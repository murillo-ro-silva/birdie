Within RCA in the early days (ca 1970s), the 1801 and 1802 microprocessors were sometimes referred to as \"the COSMAC\". Hobbyists usually refer to it simply as \"the 1802\". It is being manufactured by Intersil Corporation as a high-reliability microprocessor. The 1802 has an architecture different from most other 8-bit microprocessors.\\n\\nIn 1970 and 1971, Joseph Weisbecker developed a new 8-bit architecture computer system called FRED (Flexible Recreational Educational Device). Working on it at home, the RCA engineer hoped that FRED would become the basis of a personal computer sold by his company. RCA released Weisbecker\\'s work as the COSMAC 1801U and 1801R (also known as TA6889/TA6890 and TC 1084/TC 1085) in early 1975, using its CMOS process (called \"COS/MOS\", an acronym for \"Complementary Silicon/Metal-oxide Semiconductor\"). In 1976, a team led by Jerry Herzog integrated the two chips into one, the 1802.\\n\\nSuccessors to the 1802 are the CDP1804, CDP1805, and CDP1806, which have an extended instruction set, other enhanced features (like on-chip RAM and ROM, and built-in Timer), with some versions running at faster clock speeds, though not a significant speed difference. Some features are also lost, like the DMA auto-boot loader functionality. There are also some minor pin function changes.\\n\\nSection::::Introduction.\\nThe RCA 1802 has a static core CMOS design with no minimum clock frequency, so that it can be run at very low speeds and low power, including a clock frequency of zero to suspend the microprocessor without affecting its operation. It has two separate 8-pin buses: an 8-bit bidirectional data bus and a time-multiplexed address bus, with the high-order and low-order 8-bits of the 16-bit address being accessed on alternate clock cycles.\\n\\nThe 1802 has a single bit, programmable and testable output port (Q), and four input pins which are directly tested by branch instructions (EF1-EF4).\\n\\nIts I/O mode is flexible and programmable, and it has a single-phase clock with an on-chip oscillator. Its register set consists of sixteen 16-bit registers. The program counter (PC) can reside in any of these, and is settable using the SEP Rn instruction, providing a simple way to implement multiple PCs, and to perform subroutine calls. (see Subroutine calls below). Similarly, pointers and indirect addressing use the X register (SEX Rn instruction), or the 16 registers can be used as general purpose registers. DMA In and Out and Interrupts use specific registers.\\n\\nSection::::Applications.\\nSection::::Radiation hardening.\\nIn addition to \"bulk silicon\" C2L CMOS technology, the 1802 was also available fabricated in Silicon on Sapphire (SOS) semiconductor process technology, which gives it a degree of resistance to radiation and electrostatic discharge (ESD). Along with its extreme low-power abilities, this makes the chip well-suited in space and military applications (also, at the time the 1802 was introduced, very few, if any, other radiation-hardened microprocessors were available in the market). The radiation hardened 1802 version was manufactured at Sandia National Laboratories in agreement with RCA.\\n\\nSection::::Space technology and science.\\nThe 1802 was used in many spacecraft and space science programs, experiments, projects and modules such as the Galileo spacecraft, various Earth-orbiting satellites and satellites carrying amateur radio.\\n\\nThe 1802 has also been verified from NASA source documentation to have been used in the Hubble Space Telescope, the Magellan Venus probe and others.\\n\\nSection::::Microcomputer systems.\\nA number of were based on the 1802, including the COSMAC ELF (1976), Netronics ELF II, Quest SuperELF, COSMAC VIP, Comx-35, Finnish Telmac 1800 and Oscom Nano, Yugoslav Pecom 32 and 64, and the Cybervision systems sold through Montgomery Ward in the late 70s, as well as the RCA Studio II video game console (one of the first consoles to use bitmapped graphics). The Edukit single board computer (SBC) trainer system, similar to an expanded COSMAC Elf, was offered by Modus Systems Ltd. in Britain in the early 1980s. Infinite Incorporated produced an 1802-based, S-100 bus expandable console computer trainer in the late 1970s called the UC1800, available assembled or in kit form.\\n\\nAs part of 1802 Retrocomputing hobbyist work, other computers have been built more recently (post-2000), including the Membership Card microcomputer kit that fits in an Altoids tin and the Spare Time Gizmos Elf 2000 (Elf 2K), among others. See Emulators and Simulators for other systems.\\n\\nSection::::Product integration.\\nThe 1802 was also used in scientific instruments and commercial products. \\nPost-1980 Chrysler and associated model vehicles use the 1802 in their second-generation Electronic Lean-Burn System, with electronic spark control, one of the first on-board auto computer-based control systems.\\n\\nThe 1802 was used in the manufacture of many pinball machines and video arcade games in Spain.\\n\\nSection::::Programming languages.\\nThe first high-level language available for the 1802 was Forth, provided by Forth, Inc. in 1976. Other available programming languages, both interpreters and compilers, are CHIP-8 (and variants), 8th (a version of Forth created by Lee Hart), Tom Pittman\\'s Tiny BASIC, C, various Assemblers and cross-assemblers, and others. Other specialty languages were used by federal agencies such as NASA and its installations, including Johnson Space Center, AMES, Goddard, Langley, Marshall, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which included the HAL/S cross-compiler, STOIC, a Forth-like language, and others.\\n\\nSection::::Emulators and simulators.\\nThe 1802 chip and computers using the microprocessor have been emulated and simulated in hardware and/or software by hobbyists. One design is in VHDL for an FPGA. A bus-accurate, full speed COSMAC Elf clone was created without a CDP1802 microprocessor chip or CDP1861 video chip using PIC microcontrollers. An online simulator of the COSMAC Elf (enhanced) written in JavaScript runs in the user\\'s browser with no need to download.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\nSection::::Part number suffix designations.\\nVarious suffixes to the CDP1802 part number denote technical specifications, including (A, B, & C) \"operating speed\" (3.2\\xa0MHz to 6.4\\xa0MHz), \"temperature\" (-40\\xa0Â°C to +85\\xa0Â°C, -55\\xa0Â°C to +125\\xa0Â°C), and \"voltage ranges\" (4V to 10.5V), \"package type\" (D, E, Q), and \"burn-in\" (X). These were somewhat standardized between the various source suppliers, including RCA, Intersil, Harris, Hughes Aircraft, and Solid State Scientific (SSS). Hughes used the HCMP prefix, and SSS used the SCP (and possibly BCP) prefix, instead of CDP, and had additional suffixes that have not been documented as of yet. (examples: CDP1802A, CDP1802ACE, CDP1802BCD, HCMP1802AP, SCP1802D)\\n\\nSection::::Registers and I/O.\\nThe 1802 is an 8-bit byte machine, with minimal support for 16-bit operations, except via 2-byte manipulation. The primary accumulator is the 8-bit \\'D\\' register (Data register). The single bit carry flag is DF (Data Flag). Most operations use the D register, including arithmetic and logic and memory reference load and store instructions. Most 16-bit operations have to work on the lower byte and then the upper byte, via D, using the DF as carry and borrow as needed. Instructions allow the get and put of the upper and lower bytes of the sixteen 16-bit registers via D. However, the 16-bit registers can be incremented and decremented with single instructions, and a few instructions perform automatic increment and decrement, like LDA (load advance) and STXD (store via X and decrement). 16-bit register and value comparisons would also need to use the D register as a go-between, using multiple instructions to perform the operations.\\n\\nAn important feature of the 1802 is the register design of sixteen registers of 16 bits each. Using the SEP instruction, you can select any of the 16 registers to be the program counter; using the SEX instruction, you can select any of the 16-bit registers to be the index register. Register R0 has the special use of holding the memory address for the built-in DMA controller. Register R1 has the special use of being the program counter for the interrupt handler.\\n\\nThe processor has five special I/O lines. There is a single Q output that can be set with the SEQ instruction and reset with the REQ instruction. There are four external, single-bit flag inputs, EF1, EF2, EF3, and EF4, and there are eight dedicated branch instructions to conditionally branch based on the state of those input lines. There are seven Input and seven Output port instructions that utilize the RX register and D accumulator.\\n\\nThe EF and Q lines were typically used for multiple interfaces on 1802-based hobbyist computers because of the lines\\' favorable and easy handling. It was typical for the Q line to drive a status LED, a cassette interface, an RS-232 interface, and the speaker. This meant that the user could actually hear RS-232 and cassette data being transmitted (unless a volume control was implemented). Traditionally, the EF4 line is attached to the INPUT momentary pushbutton on the COSMAC Elf. Other systems might use one of the other lines.\\n\\nThere are some other special use registers and flags, some internal, and some usable programmatically: 4-bit N, P, X, and I; 8-bit T; and 1-bit IE.\\n\\nSection::::Branching.\\nThere are three types of unconditional and conditional branching in the 1802, Short and Long, and Skips.\\n\\nShort branches are 2-byte instructions, and use 256-byte range, single byte address, page absolute addressing in the range 0 to 255 (hex FF). There is no relative branching. The short branch always jumps within the page that contains the address byte.\\n\\nLong branches use full 16-bit addressing to support the 64K memory address space, and are the only 3-byte instructions.\\n\\nSkip instructions increment the PC by one for the unconditional Short Skip, or two for the Long Skips. Only the Long Skip has conditional branching.\\n\\nSection::::Subroutine calls.\\nThe processor does not have standard subroutine CALL address and RET instructions, though they can be simulated. The 16-register design makes possible some interesting subroutine call and return mechanisms, though they are better suited to small programs than general purpose coding.\\n\\nA few commonly used subroutines can be called quickly by keeping their address in one of the 16 registers; however, the called subroutine must know (hard coded) what the calling PC register is to perform the \"return\" instruction. The SEP instruction is used to call a subroutine pointed to by one of the 16-bit registers and another SEP to return to the caller (SEP stands for \"Set Program Counter\", and selects which one of the 16 registers is to be used as the program counter from that point onward). Before a subroutine returns, it jumps to the location immediately preceding its entry point so that after the SEP \"return\" instruction returns control to the caller, the register will be pointing to the right value for next usage. (the processor always increments the PC after reference and usage (retrieving the next instruction to execute), so this technique works as noted)\\n\\nAn interesting variation of this scheme is to have two or more subroutines in a ring so that they are called in round robin order. On early hobbyist computers, tricks and techniques like this were commonly used in the horizontal refresh interrupt to reprogram the scan line address to repeat each scan line four times for the video controller.\\n\\nOne well-known and often-used routine is known as SCRT (Standard CALL and RETURN Technique), which allows general purpose subroutine Call and Return, including passing of parameters \"in line\", and nested subroutines using a stack. Although any of the available registers can be used for this technique, per programmer\\'s preference, many use the routine supplied by RCA in the CDP1802 User Manual, where the suggested register usage is R2 = Stack Pointer, R3 = General Program Counter (PC), R4 = Call, R5 = Return, R6 = Passed Arguments Pointer (non-destructive). Even though these supportive routines are small, there is an execution speed overhead using them. (as opposed to what would be incurred if actual CALL and RET instructions were part of the microprocessor\\'s design) This setup allows R0 to be used for DMA and R1 to be used for Interrupts, if desired, allowing R7 through RF (hex) for general program usage.\\n\\nSection::::Addressing modes.\\nBecause of the 16-bit address bus, and the 8-bit data bus, the sixteen general purpose registers are 16 bits wide, but the accumulator D-register is only 8 bits wide. The accumulator, therefore, tends to be a bottleneck. Transferring the contents of one register to another involves four instructions (one Get and one Put on the HI byte of the register, and a similar pair for the LO byte: GHI R1; PHI R2; GLO R1; PLO R2). Similarly, loading a new constant into a register (such as a new address for a subroutine jump, or the address of a data variable) also involves four instructions (two load immediate, LDI, instructions, one for each half of the constant, each one followed by a Put instruction to the register, PHI and PLO).\\n\\nThe two addressing modes \"Indirect register\", and \"Indirect register with auto-increment\" are then fairly efficient, to perform 8-bit operations on the data in the accumulator. There are no other addressing modes, though. Thus, the \"direct addressing\" mode needs to be emulated using the four instructions mentioned earlier to load the address into a spare register; followed by an instruction to select that register as the index register; followed, finally, by the intended operation on the data variable that is pointed to by that address.\\n\\nSection::::DMA and load mode.\\nThe CDP1802 has a built-in DMA controller, having two DMA request lines for DMA input and output operations. R0 is used as the DMA address pointer.\\n\\nThe DMA controller also provides a special \"load mode\", which allows loading of memory while the CLEAR and WAIT inputs of the processor are active. This allows a program to be loaded without the need for a ROM-based bootstrap loader. This was used by the COSMAC Elf microcomputer and its successors to load a program from toggle switches or a hexadecimal keypad with no required software and minimal hardware.\\n\\nSection::::Instruction timing.\\nClock cycle efficiency is poor in comparison to most 8-bit microprocessors. Eight clock cycles makes up one machine cycle. Most instructions take two machine cycles (16 clock cycles) to execute; the remaining instructions take three machine cycles (24 clock cycles). By comparison, the MOS Technology 6502 takes two to seven clock cycles to execute an instruction, and the Intel 8080 takes four to 18 clock cycles.\\n\\nSection::::Support chips.\\nSection::::Graphics.\\nIn early 1802-based microcomputers, the companion graphics Video Display Controller chip, RCA CDP1861 (for the NTSC video format, CDP1864 variant for PAL), used the built-in DMA controller to display black and white bitmapped graphics on standard TV screens. The 1861 was also known as the Pixie graphics system.\\n\\nAlthough the faster versions of 1802 could operate at 4â5\\xa0MHz (at 5\\xa0V; it was faster (6.4\\xa0MHz) at 10\\xa0V), it was usually operated at 3.58\\xa0MHz divided by 2 (1.76\\xa0MHz) to suit the requirements of the 1861 chip which gave a speed of a little over 100,000 instructions per second.\\n\\nThe CDP1862 Color Generator Circuit IC, an 1861 companion chip, could be used to generate color graphics. Some computer systems, like the Pecom 64, used the VIS (Video Interface System), consisting of the CDP1869 and CDP1870 companion ICs, for somewhat higher resolution color graphics.\\n\\nSection::::Code samples.\\nThis code snippet example is a diagnostic routine that tests ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) Operations.\\n\\nNote: The above routine presumes that the CDP1802 microprocessor is in an initial reset state (or that it has been set as such prior to executing this code). Therefore, the program counter (PC) and the X indirect register \\'pointer\\' are both set to 16-bit register R0. That is why you can output an immediate value, as in the example \\'OUT 4,00\\', because PC and X are both pointing to R0. The PC is incremented after the opcode instruction byte is retrieved from memory, so it points to the next address when the OUT 4 is executed. Therefore, it outputs the value in memory pointed to by RX = R0, which is the next immediate byte. The OUT instruction also increments the X register, which is R0, which is also the PC, so it outputs the immediate value after the OUT and continues program execution at the next instruction address after the immediate value. This is why you see the routine set X (SEX) to register R6 and R0 as needed. Also note that, although the OUT opcode increments the RX register, to easily output a section of memory (\\'buffer\\'), INP does not. It stores the value at the address pointed to by RX and into the D 8-bit data byte accumulator, but RX is not modified.\\n\\nThe routine also presumes that OUT 4 will display the value in the CPU system\\'s 8-bit LED or 2-digit hex display, and IN 4 gets the value from the eight toggle switches (or possibly the hex keypad). The BN4 opcode (loop; * = \\'this address\\'), \"branch if the single-bit input EF4 line is lo\", is used to test if the momentary \\'Input\\' pushbutton is pressed. The B4 opcode (\\'if hi\\') loop waits for the button to be released. SEQ and REQ turn the single Q line, which is usually attached to an LED, on and off.\\n\\nThe 1802 is a \"byte machine\", but has 16 16-bit registers, R0-RF (sometimes referred to as 0-F without the \\'R\\' prefix). To deal with 16-bit register data, the programmer must Get and Put the Hi or Lo values of the registers using the D accumulator as the go-between. These high and low bytes of the registers are sometimes referred to as Rn.0 (lo) and Rn.1 (hi). Short Branches are 2-byte opcodes with page-absolute addressing, and a 256-byte address boundary.

This school is the only public high school within the city limits of Hutchinson. The enrollment for 2013-2014 was 1,487 students. The school mascot is the Salthawk and the school colors are blue and gold. During 2016-2017, the principal is Ronn Roehm and activities director is Kevin Armstrong.\\n\\nHutchinson High School is a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Athletic teams compete in the 5A and 6A divisions and are known as the \"Salthawks\". Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. The Salthawk football team won six consecutive state championships from 2004-2009.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe first high school in Hutchinson was established in 1872 to help educate the growing population of Hutchinson. The first high school graduating class occurred in 1882. Due to the demand for more space, a new high school was constructed in 1891 at 5th and Maple. This location would last for nineteen years. In 1910, the city voted to approve the construction of a new $125,000 high school, located at 7th and Walnut. In 1930, the Salt Hawk (shortened to Salthawk in the 1990s) became the school\\'s official mascot. The high school would remain in this location until 1960 when, due to inadequate conditions, Hutchinson High moved to its current location at 13th and Severance.\\n\\nSection::::School layout.\\nHutchinson High School consists of several halls. A Hall is the longest hall in the school. It is attached to the Salthawk Activity Center at the west and runs to the east where it turns north toward the cafeteria. A Hall is bisected by the recently constructed M Hall which houses upgraded drama, band, orchestra and choir rooms. The \"M-Hall Expansion\" also included the construction of a new auditorium, allowing for the old one to be repurposed into a learning facility. This also created new space for an upgraded 3-D art room, making use of the previous \"backstage\" area. Apart from A and M hall, there is B, C, G, F, and V halls. The Hutchinson Career and Vocational Technology Education (HCTEA or V hall) buildings, including the recently constructed T Building, stand alone. There are three gymnasiums on campus (North Gym, South Gym, and the Main Gym/Salthawk Activity Center, known better as \\'the SAC\\') Many students attend classes and athletics practices (dominant swimming) at the YMCA close to campus. Students are also allowed to make the short trip to nearby Hutchinson Community College to take classes.\\n\\nSection::::Extracurricular activities.\\nThe Salthawks are classified as a 6A school, the largest classification in Kansas according to the Kansas State High School Activities Association.

They have traditionally been a Democratic constituency, in the main.\\n\\nSection::::Hispanic/Latino Participation and Key Issues.\\nAccording to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates as of July 1, 2013, there are roughly 54 million Hispanics living in the United States, representing approximately 17% of the U.S. total population, making people of Hispanic origin the nation\\'s largest ethnic minority. Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics, the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position among Hispanics overall. The U.S. Census indicates that the Hispanic population of the United States is the fastest growing minority group in the country.\\n\\nMore than 9% of eligible voters nationwide are Latino. The majority support for Democratic candidates continues a pattern among Hispanic voters. In a December 2011 poll, 67% of Hispanics said they were Democrats, and 20% said they were Republicans.\\n\\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, 60% of Hispanics voted Democratic, while 38% voted Republican. In 2008, 67% of Hispanics voted for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, while 31% of Hispanics voted for Republican presidential candidate John McCain. In 2006, 69% of Latino voters supported Democratic candidates in congressional races, while 30% supported Republican candidates.\\n\\nAccording to an October 2010 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, Hispanics rank education, jobs, and health care as their top three issues of concern. Immigration ranks as the fourth most important issue for all Latinos.\\n\\nA 2012 study by the Center for Immigration Studies projected that in November 2012 Hispanics would comprise 17.2 percent of the total U.S. population, 15 percent of adults, 11.2 percent of adult citizens, and 8.9 percent of actual voters. By comparison, the report found that in 2012, non-Hispanic whites are expected to be 73.4 percent of the national vote and non-Hispanic blacks are expected to be 12.2 percent. The report noted that by weight \"eight percentage points of the Hispanic vote nationally equals slightly less than one percentage point of the non-Hispanic white vote.\" The study also compared the 8.9 percent Hispanic share of voters to veterans (12 percent of the electorate), those with family incomes above $100,000 (18 percent), seniors 65 and older (19 percent), married persons (60 percent), and those who live in owner-occupied housing (80 percent).\\n\\nIn terms of voter turnout, the Center for Immigration Studies projected that 52.7 percent (Â± 0.6) of eligible Hispanics will vote in the 2012 election, an increase from 49.9 percent in 2008 and a continuation of the past decade\\'s long upward trend. The projected Hispanic voter participation rate of 52.7 percent compares to 66.1 percent for non-Hispanic whites and 65.2 percent for non-Hispanic blacks in 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Democrats and Hispanic/Latino Voters.\\nSupport for the Democratic Party among Hispanics has remained strong because of the Democratic Party\\'s platform of less immigration restrictions, civil rights for Hispanics, and support for social programs that tend to benefit low-income Hispanic families. Although some Latino leaders have criticized the party for not doing enough to help Latino candidates move from city council, legislative and congressional seats to the party\\'s highest elected offices. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a candidate in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, has noted that victories by Hispanic Republican candidates in several key races during the 2010 election cycle, including Marco Rubio in Florida\\'s U.S. Senate race and the elections of Brian Sandoval as Nevada\\'s first Hispanic governor and Susana Martinez as the country\\'s first Latina governor, have posed a significant challenge to the Democratic Party in retaining support among Hispanic and Latino voters. \"Democrats have to recruit more Hispanic candidates and they have to start siding with Hispanics on redistricting and other issues,\" Richardson said, \"because many Hispanics perceive the party doesn\\'t care enough about electing more Hispanic officials.\"\\n\\nOther Hispanic Democrats, including former DNC vice-chairwoman Linda Chavez-Thompson, have accused the party of taking Hispanic support for granted, and not doing enough to increase turnout among Latinos: \"I think for the longest time [the Democratic Party], including myself, automatically thought that if you were a Latino you voted Democrat,\" she said. \"Thatâs not true anymore. We need to ramp up our Latino outreach. We canât sit back and let the Republicans take votes because we donât have a message for Latino voters.\" Chavez-Thompson, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 2010, further stated that more money and effort needs to be spent by the Democratic Party and its supporters on targeted messaging, recruitment. \\n\\nThe Democratic Party however has some issues with Hispanics regarding abortion, gay rights, and stance on limited government, especially in matters of religious freedom.\\n\\nSection::::Republicans and Hispanic/Latino Voters.\\nSection::::Republican Outreach to Hispanic and Latino Voters.\\nRepublicans have long maintained their party is a natural fit for Hispanics, particularly recent immigrants, because of the party\\'s social conservatism, anti-abortion stance and positions for private school vouchers and other school choice proposals as well as lower taxes. Republicans are trying to chip away at Hispanicsâ overall 2-1 preference for Democrats.\\n\\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich have taken proactive measures. Jeb Bush chairs the Hispanic Leadership Network, an ongoing effort by the American Action Network and the American Action Forum to provide a platform for the Hispanic community to connect with center-right policies and leaders. Newt Gingrich started The Americano, a bilingual news and commentary web site that promotes conservative ideals within the Hispanic community.\\n\\nSection::::Hispanic/Latino Criticism of the Republican Party.\\nThe main divider between Hispanics and Republicans is the differing views and perceived harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration and racism. 81% of Latinos believe that unauthorized immigrants should not be deported. Some Republicans encourage reforming the immigration system, while other Republicans advocate deporting them all. Republicans also support efforts to enforce the law (deporting illegal aliens), while most Republicans are open to welcoming back immigrants who enter America through legal avenues.\\n\\nFormer Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. said, âIf we become perceived as an anti-immigrant party, America, being a country of immigrants, will never allow us to be the majority party.â \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hispanic and Latino American politics in the United States', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7126155'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'QgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7126672', 'text': 'Mariano\\n\\nMariano is a masculine name from the Romance languages, corresponding to the feminine Mariana.\\n\\nIt is an Italian, Spanish and Portuguese variant of the Roman Marianus which derived from Marius, and Marius derived from the Roman god Mars (see also Ares) or from the Latin \"maris\" \"male\".\\n\\nMariano and Marian are sometimes seen as a conjunction of the two female names Mary and Ann. This name is an homage to The Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus.\\n\\nMariano, as a surname, is of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese origin from the personal name \"Mariano\", from the Latin family name \"Marianus\" (a derivative of the ancient personal name \"Marius\", of Etruscan origin). In the early Christian era it came to be taken as an adjective derived from \"Maria\", and was associated with the cult of the Virgin Mary. It was borne by various early saints, including a 3rd-century martyr in Numibia and a 5th-century hermit of Berry, France. It is also a Sephardic Jewish surname derived from the term Merano. The term, which is frequently derived from the New Testament phrase \"maran atha\" (\"our Lord hath come\"), denotes in Spanish \"damned,\" \"accursed,\" \"banned\"; also \"hog,\" and in Portuguese it is used as an opprobrious epithet of the Jews because they do not eat pork. The name was applied to the Spanish Jews who, through compulsion or for form\\'s sake, became converted to Christianity in consequence of the cruel persecutions of 1391 and of Vicente Ferrer\\'s missionary sermons.

It is the first album to feature Dean Butterworth on drums, who joined the band in March 2005 after former drummer Chris Wilson departed in 2005. Billy Martin has mentioned in an interview that Benji Madden came up with the name for the album. This style can be heard in the album\\'s third single, \"Dance Floor Anthem\", which is the most successful song on the album by debuting at No. 2 on the Australian charts and reaching No.25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It is the final album by Good Charlotte to be released through Daylight Records; they subsequently signed a deal with Capitol.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nIn March 2005, the band went on a UK tour. While on this tour, the band were working on new material on their tour bus. Vocalist Joel Madden expressed an interest to move beyond three-chord song structures, as first displayed on \"The Chronicles of Life and Death\". Guitarist Billy Martin has kept this in mind while writing the majority of the material. At this point, Madden reckoned they had anywhere from a quarter to half an album\\'s worth of songs. In May, drummer Chris Wilson left the group and was replaced by Dean Butterworth. The group met him through John Feldmann of Goldfinger. In August, the band revealed they would be recording later in the year with producer Eric Valentine. Madden had been revisiting acts he used to enjoy, such as Oasis, the Police and the Clash. He also mentioned that it would feature a large amount of keyboards, played by Martin.\\n\\nUp to this point, they had 12 songs written, and had plans to go into pre-production in November and record in December. Instead, they took a break to focus on their personal lives. Martin worked on painting while the Madden brothers spent time producing other acts and DJing. They eventually got the urge to work again and reconvened in February 2006. The band reconnected with Don Gilmore, who produced their first album, and showed him the 50 songs they had written. Gilmore was dismissive of all of the material, except for \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\".\\n\\nDave Massey, executive vice president of A&R at Sony Music Labels Group and Gilmore proposed that they reinvent themselves; a view the Madden brothers also shared. Massey said: \"[They] wrote some very promising early songs, but both Don and myself really wanted to push the envelop as to what could be achieved\". Gilmore recommended that the Madden brothers needed to escape from the Los Angeles scene in order to focus on the songs, suggesting Vancouver, Canada. Vancouver\\'s picturesque environment was used as inspiration, and over the course of seven weeks, they wrote a new batch of songs. The group were anxious and scared about impressing Gilmore; after they wrote \"Victims of Love\", Joel Madden said they \"felt like \\'OK, now we\\'re definitely on to something new and different.\\'\"\\n\\nSection::::Recording.\\nEvery two weeks, the band would get together and show each other the songs they had. All of the ones they liked, they made demos of. They eventually demoed around 40 from the Madden brothers, 12 from Martin and five from bassist Paul Thomas. The demos were sent in batches of ten to Gilmore, who would often respond saying he only liked one of the tracks. Gilmore challenged the band to write new material that was different for them. The group demoed another 30 songs before they began recording the final choices in July. The band had previously met with a number of producers, but eventually went with Gilmore due to his helpful comments on the demos.\\n\\nSessions took place at Armoury Studios and The Warehouse in Vancouver, and at NRG Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Recording was handled by Mark Kiczula with assistant engineer Fox Phelps. Martin used his Paul Reed Smith guitar for 3/4s of recording, while the remaining quarter was done with a John 5 Telecaster. They were played through Mesa Boogie and Dual Rectifiers heads connected to Marshall amplifiers. He used a Eventide H3000 Harmonizer effects pedal on nearly all of the songs. Benji Madden played Ernie Ball running through JCM heads connected to Marshall amplifiers.\\n\\nThe band were conversing with Avenged Sevenfold during the MTV Video Music Awards and invited them to the studio to hear the album. Joel Madden queried if they wanted to appear on a song, and picked \"The River\". M. Shadows lends his vocals and Synyster Gates contributed a guitar solo to the track. Bobbie Page, Terry Wood, Maxine Waters and Carmen Carter sung backing vocals on \"All Black\". The Incognito Horns played horns on \"Broken Hearts Parade\". BC Smith and Bart Hendrickson did programming. Sessions concluded on September 14, and the recordings were sent for mixing three days later. They were mixed by Andy Wallace at Soundtrack Studios in New York City. John O\\'Mahony served as Pro Tools engineer with assistance from Mike Scielzi. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City.\\n\\nSection::::Composition.\\nThe group wanted to move away from the dark overtones of their past work. Joel Madden said that since their contemporaries\\' music was \"getting really dramatic\", they decided to move into dance-orientated territory, incorporating hip hop and dance elements into their pop punk sound. The album features a heavy use of keyboards compared to \"The Chronicles of Life and Death\". According to Martin, they toyed with keyboards a bit on \"Chronicles\", which everyone enjoyed. As a result, when writing for \"Good Morning Revival\", Martin would work on an idea with a keyboard instead of his guitar. Madden said Butterwoth was important to the making of the album, saying he was from a \"different school\" of drumming. Martin said the album\\'s title is meant to \"represent a fresh kind of starting over\". Discussing \"Misery\", Madden said they lived in a \"world full of distraction, and no one is supposed to be sad or feel anything but great and happy and do whatever it takes to be happy\".\\n\\n\"The River\" talks about people who get involved in the lifestyle of Los Angeles and lose their identity as a result. Madden said \"Dance Floor Anthem\" was a break-up song that encouraged someone to \"Get out there and meet somebody, have a good time. â¦ Forget about it. Don\\'t buy into the drama.\" \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was inspired by DJ Junior Sanchez, who was a friend of Madden\\'s, after Sanchez taught Madden about DJ and dance culture. Madden had intended for the song to be released by Sanchez. However, it was included on the album after people were positive towards the song. Discussing \"Where Would We Be Now\", \"Break Apart Her Heart\" and \"Something Else\", Joel Madden said \"Love is a big part of me and I\\'ve accepted that and it\\'s in my music. And I\\'m not afraid to just show it.\" \"Beautiful Place\" was written by Benji Madden while he was in Mexico. When Butterworth laid down a drum track for it, the drums became part of the hook. Madden said \"March On\" was partially inspired by the Cardigans\\' \"Lovefool\".\\n\\nSection::::Release.\\nIn mid-September, \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was posted on the group\\'s website. In September and October, the group went on a headlining club tour with The Pink Spiders. In December, the group filmed a music video for \"The River\" in Los Angeles, California with director Marc Webb. It features the Los Angeles River, which Benji Madden said was symbolic in that \"it\\'s concrete, polluted, graffitied, and when you think of \\'baptism in the river\\' [the chorus of the song], you think peaceful and serene\". Joel Madden said in an interview with MuchMusic that the album release has been pushed back to early March 2007. In January 2007, the Madden brothers went on a promotional South Pacific tour. On January 15, \"The River\" was released to radio. The following day, a music video was released for \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\", directed by Marvin Scott Jarrett.\\n\\nThe music video for \"The River\" premiered on TV on February 5. It featured performance scenes next to the Los Angeles river, mixed in footage of other places in Los Angeles. To promote the video, the band partnered with Bix.com to create a web portal that allowed their fans to upload pictures that could be incorporated in the background of the video. These customized clips could then be sent to friends and appear on social networking platforms. \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was released as a CD single in Australia on February 24 with a Broken Spindles remix and music video of the track, an acoustic version of \"I Just Wanna Live\" and \"Face the Strange\" as B-sides. \"Good Morning Revival\" was released on March 27 through Epic and Daylight Records. Physical retailers, such as Target, Best Buy, Circuit City and Walmart, were each given exclusive bonus tracks, as did digital retailer iTunes. The Australian edition featured a DVD, which included \"The River\" music, a making-of video, and an EPK.\\n\\n\"Dance Floor Anthem\" was released as a CD single in Australia on June 30 with radio and album versions of the song and a Brass Knuckles remix of \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" as B-sides. Also included was the music video to \"Dance Floor Anthem\", which was filmed in Canada and directed by Sean Michael Turrell. The band supported Justin Timberlake on the US leg of his FutureSex/LoveShow tour in August and September. In October, the group on a tour of Australia. \"Misery\" was released as a CD single in Australia on December 12 with a live version of the track as a B-side. \"Where Would We Be Now\" was released to US radio on May 20, 2008. In July and August, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Boys Like Girls, with support from Metro Station and the Maine, dubbed the Soundtrack of Your Summer tour. Benji Madden posted an outtake \"No Communication\" from the album sessions on their website in May 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nInitial critical response to \"Good Morning Revival\" has been mostly mixed, with a score of 45/100 points on review aggregator site Metacritic, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The New York Times gave the album a negative review, calling it \"a mystifyingly inept CD that includes some of the worst lyrics you will â or, with any luck, wonât â hear all year.\" The Guardian said \"\"Revival\" is a fourth album of stunning fatuousness.\" Dr Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic said \"Good Morning Revival is inconsistent; downright sinful at times, it contains sparks of brilliance and some very creditable pop moments.\" \"Alternative Press\" said \"Good Charlotte have become caricatures of themselves\". \"NOW Magazine\" said \"After years and years of hating every ounce of Maryland\\'s mall-punk icons Good Charlotte, it seems now that the actual trick to enjoying their music on any plausible level is to go into the whole thing with absolutely no expectations. Not even low expectations. Nothing.\" However, \"Billboard\" was positive of the album, calling it \"an album that proves being rich and famous doesn\\'t always blunt a band\\'s creative appetite.\"\\n\\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" placed the album at number 4 on their list of worst albums of 2007. By May 2008, the album had sold 284,000 copies in the US. In 2016, Benji Madden said of the album: \"This was when we either could have quit or do what we did. â¦ We could have tried to make The Young And The Hopeless again, but that, to me, would have been giving up\" Later that year, Joel Madden said it was his favorite Good Charlotte album, and that \"people donât give it the credit it needs, as a record and for where we were at for our age. I think we really put together a body of work that was cohesive.\"\\n\\nSection::::Track listing.\\nAll songs by Benji Madden, Joel Madden and Don Gilmore, except where noted.\\n\\n\\nBonus tracks\\n\\nSection::::Personnel.\\nPersonnel per booklet.\\nGood Charlotte\\n\\nAdditional musicians\\n\\nProduction\\nSection::::Chart positions.\\nThe album has achieved spots on album charts in many countries.

The story holds that suspecting his imminent arrest, Polubotok secretly deposited 200,000 gold coins (chervonets) in the Bank of England, under 7.5% annual interest. The amount, the bank, and the interest vary in different versions: some sources cite two barrels of gold, or 2.5% annual interest, or the Bank of the British East India Company. In his will, Polubotok allegedly bequeathed eighty percent of the gold to a future independent Ukraine, and the rest to his successors.\\n\\nSection::::Russian investigation and recovery attempts.\\nThe story first became widely known in 1907, when it was published in the Russian journal \"New Time\" by Professor Alexander Rubets. In 1908 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia ordered the issue to be investigated by the Russian Consulate in London. Specifically, their unclaimed deposits at the Bank of England over the previous 200 years were investigated, and were found to total less than the alleged amount of Polubotok\\'s fortune.\\n\\nIn August 1913 a group of 170 individuals was met in Starodub, Chernihiv region who called themselves the offspring of Polubotok. However, none of the offspring were able to documentarily provide the bonifide documents regarding their relationship to Polubotok nor provide any information regarding the account at the Bank of England.\\n\\nSection::::Ukrainian Soviet recovery attempts.\\nA relative - Ostap Polubotok was however found in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In 1922 he met up with the Ukrainian Soviet Consul - Yuri Kotsubinsky in Vienna and had with him a copy of the 200-year-old document attesting to his legacy.\\n\\nKotsubynsky approached Hryhory Petrovsky with a plan for the recovery of the fortune.\\n\\nIn July 1922 a meeting took place between Ostap Polubotok, Robert Mitchell (from the Bank of England and because of Kotsubynsky\\'s ailment Consul Peter in Maria-Esensdorf outside of Vienna.\\n\\nThe matter however came to a halt with the removal and repression of Petrovsky and Kotsubynsky.\\n\\nSection::::Soviet investigation and recovery attempts.\\nOn January 22, 1960 under the Dwight Eisenhower administration the United States proclaimed Ukraine Day. The Soviet KGB reported that England had given money to support this propagandist action and that the money had come from the Polubotok bank account. The matter came to the attention of Nikita Khrushchev who initiated an investigation to recover the money. A commission as set up which included historians - Dr Olena Kompan, and Dr Olena Apanovych.\\n\\nIn January 1968 Olena Apanovych published her findings in a paper read at the Presidium. She was later asked not to discuss this \"state secret\".\\n\\nAccording to the investigators on 22 May 1723 Polubotok received a summons to appear in Petersburg. Polubotok thought that the matter was related to his son\\'s secret meeting with Pylyp Orlyk in France. Polubotok began his trip to the Russian capital 13 July 1723. It accompanied two huge carts of \"salt\" and \"salted fish\". The carts continued to Arkhangelsk and were put onto an English frigate from where the gold was sent to London.\\n\\nThe cargo was met in London by Polobotok\\'s son and Pylyp Orlyk and the gold was deposited into the Bank of England with two copies of Polubotok\\'s instructions in Latin. These two documents remain in the Bank of England today.\\n\\nIn the chaotic time of the Soviet Union\\'s collapse, the story again attracted public attention. In May 1990, Ukrainian poet Volodymyr Tsybulko announced that if the gold were returned, it would amount to 38 kilograms for each citizen of independent Ukraine. This astronomical figure, about twenty times the world\\'s gold reserve, was achieved due to compounding of interest over 270 years. The heated interest in the Polubotok treasury coincided with a visit to Kiev on June 9, 1990 of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Ukrainian parliament ordered the creation of a special committee headed by the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine, Dr. Petro Tronko, which visited London. The gold, however, has not been found. Recently, poet Tsybulko confessed that his speech in 1990 was propagandistic.\\n\\nSection::::Outcomes.\\nThe legend of Polubotok\\'s gold was made into a comic film.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Gold of Polubotok', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7131965'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7133957', 'text': 'Refugio Independent School District\\n\\nRefugio Independent School District is a public school district based in Refugio, Texas (USA).\\n\\nLocated in Refugio County, a small portion of the district extends into Bee and Victoria counties.\\n\\nIn 2009, the school district was rated \"academically acceptable\" by the Texas Education Agency.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Athletics.\\nOn December 16th, 2011 the Refugio Bobcats were victorious in the State Title game against the Cisco Loboes.

While a high school athlete Tyus participated in basketball and began her track endeavors as a high jumper before transitioning to the sprints after being invited to a summer track clinic at Tennessee State University in 1960. It was in this same year that Tyus\\'s father died leaving the job of male role model in Tyus\\'s life to her soon to be track coach at Tennessee State Ed Temple.\\n\\nSection::::College and professional career.\\nTyus, from Tennessee State University, participated in the 1964 Summer Olympics at age 19. In the heats of the event, she equaled Wilma Rudolph\\'s world record, propelling her to a favored position for the final, where her main rival was fellow American Edith McGuire. Tyus won the final, beating McGuire by 0.2 seconds.

In the final, she set a new world record of 11.08 s to become the first person, male or female, to retain the Olympic 100 metres title.

She was forced to take an hour bus ride to school each day, in spite of the fact that there was a white school within walking distance. Racial divide in her neighborhood also prevented Tyus from playing with the white girls that lived nearby and as the nearest black family lived almost a mile away, Tyus spent most of her time playing sports with her brothers and the white boys in the neighborhood. As she grew older her father helped to solidify the idea that she could accomplish anything in her life, but not without hard work to overcome racial stigma.\\n\\nAfter finishing high school Tyus attended Tennessee State University (TSU), making her the first of her family to go to college. While at TSU Tyus participated in the Tigerbelles collegiate team. Tyus began training with TSU coach Ed Temple, however poor grades, study habits, and a general lack of interest in her classes nearly derailed her chances to continue her training and attend the 1964 Olympics. She has credited her training with Coach Temple as helping with her development and success in her sports, academic, and professional life, especially as he highlighted the struggle that comes with being a black athlete and having to work harder to receive positive recognition.\\n\\nIn December 1968 Tyus moved with her then boyfriend from Georgia to California, where she worked as a substitute teacher. She married her boyfriend in 1969 and held multiple jobs until becoming a teacher in 1971. Tyus left this job within a year in order to stay at home with her first child. Tyus\\'s first marriage ended in 1974 and in 1978 she married Duane Tillman, with whom she had her second child, a son.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Wyomia Tyus', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71386'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7141188', 'text': \"Frank Padavan\\n\\nFrank Padavan (October 31, 1934 â October 8, 2018) was an American engineer and politician.

Lord Vlad Luciferian was later ejected from the group due to internal differences. Although the band says their lyrical themes are simply \"anti-JewishChristian and/or anti-religion\", they have been accused of far-right and racist views. Gelal Necrosodomy has responded to these accusations by stating \"black metal to me is paganism, and paganism is neo-fascism, and neo-fascism is anti-christian, and anti-christianity is black metal. It is a circle that cannot be altered for everything fits in perfectly.\"\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Early history (1992-1996).\\nThe band started in 1992 with Gelal on guitars, bass guitar and keyboards, and Bestial Luciferian on drums and vocals. By the end of the year, they recorded their debut demo, \"Goat of a Thousand Young\". The next year, they played their first concert with Kommando on bass (from Arghoslent) and Tom Philips (from While Heaven Wept) on keyboards as guests. After the show, Gelal quit the band due to his animosity toward Bestial Luciferian. The band soon split up, but Bestial Luciferian (now Lord Vlad Luciferian) tried to reform GBK, bringing with him Demonic on bass. Tom Philips was set to replace Gelal before Demonic convinced him to rejoin. This lineup then recorded the \"Triumph of the Hordes\" demo in 1994.\\n\\nAfter the release of the demo, Gelal and Demonic learned that Lord Vlad Luciferian added female voices to one of the songs without asking, and that he had messed up deals with several record companies. Gelal, now even more angry towards Lord Vlad Luciferian, fired him from the band. After this, Demonic quit the band due to lack of time, so Gelal asked The Marauder (guitar player of Arghoslent at the time) to play bass, and recruited The Black Lourde of Crucifixion on drums/vocals (Cazz Grant from Crucifier). This was the lineup which recorded the \"A Witness to the Regicide\" EP in 1996.\\n\\nSection::::\"Mocking the Philanthropist\" (1997-2000).\\nThe next LP made GBK one of the most controversial underground black metal acts in the United States. Bassist Der Sturmer (Der StÃ¼rmer was the name of a Nazi newspaper published 1923-1945) replaced the Marauder, and the new lineup recorded the LP \"Mocking the Philanthropist\" on the Belgian record label Wood-Nymph. The CD booklet contained pictures of the band wearing shirts of far-right bands (Bound for Glory and Spear of Longinus), leading to tour boycotts and other problems. In their first nine years, GBK had only played nine gigs. The album was refused distribution in Germany due to the allegedly offensive booklet. Wood-Nymph refused to print a new booklet and, as a result, the label soon folded due to the poor distribution of the album. The CD would later be repressed by Morbidund Cult and Drakkar Productions in 2004 and 2006 respectively.\\n\\nSection::::Judeobeast Assassination to Kosherat (2001-2005).\\nThe follow-up to \"Mocking the Philanthropist\" was \"Judeobeast Assassination\", released in 2001. The album\\'s lyrics focused on the inseparability of Judeo-Christianity, mocking both the New Testament and the Old Testament (\"Mocking the Philanthropist\" had focused only on the New Testament). The lyrics were much more provocative and sexually perverse than the ones on \"Mocking the Philanthropist\". The music on the album had a more bass-heavy mix and a thicker sound, something relatively uncommon in Black Metal. The album was almost twenty minutes shorter, in order to fit onto a piece of vinyl.\\n\\nIn 2002, The Black Lourde of Crucifixion left GBK to focus more on Crucifier, and he wasn\\'t interested in touring Europe. The lineup for the \"Pimps of Gennesarret Tour\" was Grimnir Wotansvolk on vocals, Gelal Necrosodomy on guitar, Demonic on bass, and the Gulag on drums; the same lineup that would record \"Kosherat\" in 2005. \"Kosherat\" was released in 2005 on Drakkar Productions, and would be the band\\'s final album before their disbandment. The album featured the new lineup of Grimnir Wotansvolk (later changed to Grimnir Heretik) on vocals, Gelal Necrosodomy on guitar, Demonic on bass, and the Gulag on drums. The album\\'s central focus was on pre-Christian Judaism, mocking such rituals as the Red Heifer and male circumcision. The album also featured three re-recorded tracks from their vinyl EPs, as well as two Chaos 88 covers.\\n\\nSection::::Recent history (2006-present).\\nVocalist Richard P. Mills died in 2006 of drug overdose. Mills, who also went by the names Grimnir Wotansvolk and G. Heretik, was the grandson of horse breeder Alice du Pont Mills, and was the owner of the National Socialist black metal record label and distributor Vinland Winds. He released Pantheon\\'s \"Ergriffenheit\" 10\" vinyl record as well as Spear of Longinus and Graveland vinyl records. The label\\'s last release was an exclusive US release of Russian far-right thrash metal band Corrosia Metalla in 2008. The same year, the last GBK recordings were released as a split album with Absurd from Germany and Sigrblot from Sweden; the tracks were recorded during the same session as the \"Kosherat\" album and were \"exclusively planned for this split\".\\n\\nThe band became active again as of 2009. In December 2009, they played Chicago\\'s Hooligan Black Metal show, along with Heathen Hammer, Martial and Absurd. The band also performed at Hell\\'s Headbash III in September 2016.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': \"Grand Belial's Key\", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7143336'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '714771', 'text': 'GÇui dialect\\n\\nGÇui or GÇwi (pronounced in English, and also spelled \"ÇGwi, Dcui, Gcwi,\" or \"Cgui\") is a Khoe dialect of Botswana with 2,500 speakers (2004 Cook). It is part of the GÇana dialect cluster, and is closely related to Naro. It has a number of loan words from ÇÊ¼Amkoe. GÇui, ÇÊ¼Amkoe, and Taa form the core of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund, and share a number of characteristic features, including extremely large consonant inventories.\\n\\nSection::::Phonology.\\nGÇui has 89 consonants (with 52 clicks) or 52 consonants (and 20 clicks), depending on analysis. There are ten vowels, and two to six tones, again depending on analysis.\\n\\nSection::::Clicks.\\nGÇui has 24 simple click consonants, plus complex clicks variously analyzed as consonant clusters or airstream contours. As with many of the TshuâKhwe languages, clicks have lost some of their importance under the influence of neighboring Bantu languages. Many words which previously began with clicks (as shown by cognates in related languages) have lost them over the past few centuries in GÇui. Nonetheless, GÇui has the largest known inventory of clicks of any Khoe language.\\n\\nGÇui has been described with a contrast between velar and uvular clicks. However, all GÇui clicks are uvular (or pharyngeal); the \\'uvular\\' part of the latter is part of an airstream contour, a transition from a click to a non-click release: effectively, the click transitions into a non-click consonant. (See NÇng language for a similar situation in another language.) Nakagawa proposes that the contour and glottalized clicks are not single sounds, but sequences of a click and a uvular or glottal consonant, though Miller (2011) notes that such an analysis creates problems when extended to other languages with clicks.\\n\\nAltogether there are thirteen such series, or \"accompaniments\", and all 52 possible combinations are found. Except for the lack of bilabial clicks, the inventory is nearly identical to that of some speakers of ÇÊ¼Amkoe, which is in intense contact with GÇui and may have borrowed some of its clicks from GÇui, and lost others not found in GÇui.\\n\\nMiller (2011), in a comparative study with other languages, interprets Nakagawa\\'s description as follows. (Nakagawa\\'s and are analyzed as and , respectively.)\\nThe voiced contour (\\'uvular\\') clicks tend to be prenasalized, .\\nAs in the majority of languages with clicks, the glottalized nasal series are pronounced with a glottal release in initial position, and prenasalized after a vowel. The contrast between glottalized oral and glottalized nasal clicks is unusual, but has also been reported from ÇÊ¼Amkoe and Yeyi since Nakagawa announced its discovery in GÇui. The Khute dialect of GÇui also has preglottalized nasal clicks allophonically. They developed from glottalized nasal clicks before pharyngealized vowels, perhaps under ÇÊ¼Amkoe influence:\\n\\nSection::::Other consonants.\\nMost words are of the form CV, CVV, CVCV, CVN, where C stands for a consonant, V for a vowel, and N for a nasal consonant (m, n). In CVCV words, only a limited set of consonants () may occur in medial position (the second syllable). Of these, two () may not occur at the beginning of a word, and due to restrictions with nasal vowels may be argued to be allophonic. The is pronounced after a lateral click or a pharyngeal vowel (but not after a velar ejective ). only occurs in mimesis. occurs in a single word, \"t\\'aa\" \\'to carve\\', which is not widely known.\\n\\nThe palatals, which are unique among Khoisan languages to GÇana-GÇui, derive historically from the alveolars before non-pharyngealized vowels. In GÇana this shift has only partly occurred.\\n\\nSection::::Vowels.\\nGÇui has five modal vowels, , three nasal vowels, , and two pharyngeal vowels, . There are diphthongs and , but they are allophones of . GÇui also has breathy-voice vowels, but they are described as part of the tone system.\\n\\nOnly the five modal vowels occur in monomoraic (CV or V) roots, which except for the noun \"ÏÃ²\" \\'thing, place, case\\' are all grammatical morphemes. These are reduced to three nasal vowels after nasal consonants, including the glottalized nasal clicks.\\n\\nThe modal vowels and the pharyngeal vowels, , occur as the first vowel (V1) of bimoraic roots, CVCV, CVV, and CVN, though the modal vowels are reduced to before a nasal coda, CVN. This corresponds to in GÇana. Pharyngeal and are also in complementary distribution: in CVV words and in CVCV and CVN words; some speakers use in CVV roots too, so that their pharyngeal vowels are reduced to .\\n\\nThe modal and nasal vowels (but not the pharyngeals) occur as the second vowel (V2) of bimoraic roots, CVCV or CVV, though only modal vowels may follow the medial consonants , and only nasal vowels follow the medial consonants . Either oral or nasal vowels may follow or null (CVV roots). That is, medial may be seen as allophones of .\\n\\nThe initial consonant (C1) may be any but . The medial consonant (C2) may be . N may be .\\n\\nThere are other vowel restrictions. V1 is always i in CVCV words when C1 is non-click palatal, for example. (This is because those sounds arose historically from alveolars followed by , which are still found in Naro.) Uvular(ized) consonants cause vowel lowering.\\n\\nSection::::Tone.\\nGÇui may be analyzed as having two abstract phonemic tones, plus breathy voice, which is covered here rather than under vowels.\\n\\nMonosyllabic morphemes carry one of two tones, high and low. Bimoraic roots carry one of six tones: high-level, high-mid (or \"high falling\"), mid-low (or \"mid\"), low-mid dipping/rising, high falling (or \"falling\"), and low falling (or \"low\"). Low falling and low-mid are accompanied by a breathy voice phonation, the other four with a clear phonation. The high and low falling tones form a natural class, triggering for example a high tone on the suffix -si, whereas the other four root tones trigger a low tone on -si.\\n\\nThat is, there are two tones or CV and V roots; two tones on bimoraic roots with breathy vowels, one of them falling; and four tones on bimoraic roots with other vowels, one of them falling. Thus there are four phonemic tones on CVCV, CVV, and CVN roots, the number expected if there are two possible tones on each mora, with moraic N carrying tone, though their contours are not simple juxtapositions of high/low + high/low.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'GÇui dialect', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714771'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7152031', 'text': 'Killing machine\\n\\nKilling machine may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Killing machine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7152031'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'UAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7152303', 'text': \"Eivind Aadland\\n\\nEivind Aadland (born 19 September 1956) is a Norwegian conductor and violinist.

The world the characters inhabit is one more technologically advanced than our own, but also home to the strange and supernatural. Beyond the comic itself, the world of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is expanded upon by supplemental prose material, including \"The New Traveller\\'s Almanac\", \"Allan and the Sundered Veil\", and the documents from the \"\".\\n\\nSection::::The British Isles.\\nIn the \"Black Dossier\", the alternate history of the League\\'s United Kingdom is explored in depth. As in medieval Welsh Mythology, in approximately 1100 BC, Brutus of Troy founds the kingdom of Britain (then called Brutain) with the capital at New Troy. He is accompanied by the ageless and gender swapping , who aids Brutus in subduing Brutain\\'s population of savage giants and their chieftain, Gogmagog. In 43 AD Britain is invaded by the Roman Empire under Claudius. In 363, the year of Merlin\\'s birth, the Emperor Julian declares Britain a pagan nation. In 410 the Romans withdrew, and Uther Pendragon rose to power. Circa 450, his son Arturus became king, ruling until 468. Britain descended into barbarism, plagued by ogres, giants, and faeries ruled by Arthur\\'s half-sister Morgana. The faerie remained a powerful force in Britain, so much so that King Henry VIII took the second cousin of King Oberon of the Faerie, the polydactyl Faery-blooded Anne Boleyn, as his wife. From this union sprang Queen Gloriana the First, who reigned from 1558 to 1603. Under her rule, magical and otherworldly forces became more popular in Britain. Her court held such notables as Johannes Suttle, Edward Face, Sir Jack Wilton, and Sir Basildon Bond (ancestor to Campion and James Bond). Gloriana was also the patron and associate of William Shakespeare.\\n\\nAfter her death, the puritanical magic hater King Jacob the First ascended to the throne, and proceeded to purge the faerie and other supernatural races from Britain, resulting in the faerie kingdom cutting all ties with the human world by 1616. It was also under Jacob\\'s rule that the King Jacob Bible was compiled. Beginning in 1610, Prospero, by order of a decree written by Gloriana before her death, began to assemble the first \\'League\\' of extraordinary individuals to defend Britain. The group disbanded when Prospero returned to the Blazing World, but was succeeded by similar groups in the 1740s, early 19th century, 1890s, early 20th century, and a failed group in the 1950s.\\n\\nIn the late 1890s the United Kingdom was attacked by Martian invaders, who were defeated via germ warfare. The nation went on to fight in World War I and against the Germany of Adenoid Hynkel in World War II. After the war, General Sir Harold Wharton, an agent implanted by rogue factions of MI5 into the Labour Party, took power and turned the United Kingdom into a communist dictatorship. Under Wharton\\'s Ingsoc government, cameras monitored citizens\\' daily activities, torture of dissidents was widespread, and a reduced and simplified version of English known as Newspeak was made the official language of the state. After Wharton\\'s death in 1952, he was succeeded by Gerald O\\'Brien. O\\'Brien was unable to maintain power, and conceded to the Conservative Party\\'s demands to be reinstated as an official party. Soon after he was voted out of office, and most of the Ingsoc government\\'s programs were reversed.

VPython allows users to create objects such as spheres and cones in 3D space and displays these objects in a window. This makes it easy to create simple visualizations, allowing programmers to focus more on the computational aspect of their programs. The simplicity of VPython has made it a tool for the illustration of simple physics, especially in the educational environment.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn 1985, the cT programming language was created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. Contributors to the project included David Andersen, Bruce Sherwood, Judith Sherwood, and Kevin Whitley. The cT programming language was largely spawned from the TUTOR (1965) and the MicroTutor (1977) programming languages. Although cT had many applications, its primary usage was 2D graphics for the classroom setting. cT was used for a variety of purposes, but its main niche was the creation of programs for education. Many prize-winning educational programs were written in cT (see VISQ), especially in the area of physics. In 1997, students at Carnegie Mellon were taught cT in a new introductory physics course created by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood.\\n\\nIn 1998, David Scherer entered the university as a freshman and enrolled in one of the introductory physics classes that used cT. Although cT offered a relatively easy 2D graphics programming environment, Scherer saw the possibility of creating an even better tool. In the spring and summer of 2000, with the assistance of David Andersen, Ruth Chabay, Ari Heitner, Ian Peters, and Bruce Sherwood, Scherer created Visual, a module for Python that was not only easier to use than the cT programming language, but also rendered objects in three dimensions. The combination of Python plus Visual is called VPython. Further development of the cT programming language was ended and the newly created VPython was used in its place. Since VPython\\'s creation, several versions have been released to the public.\\n\\nIn 2016, developers announced that classic VPython would no longer be developed. Instead, development will concentrate on Glowscript and Jupyter implementations of the language.\\n\\nSection::::Usage.\\nVPython is a simple rendering tool for 3D objects and graphs. Its main use has been in education, but it has also been used in commercial or research settings. VPython was first used in introductory physics courses at Carnegie Mellon and then spread to other universities and eventually high schools, especially in connection with the Matter & Interactions curriculum.\\n\\nA related development due to David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood is GlowScript, which makes it possible to write and run VPython programs in a browser, including on mobile devices, thanks to the RapydScript Python-to-JavaScript compiler, created by Alexander Tsepkov. Programs can be written, run, and stored at glowscript.org, and the compiled-to-JavaScript code can be exported and embedded in one\\'s own web page. John Coady has created the ivisual version for use in the IPython, now Jupyter environment, using the GlowScript WebGL graphics libraries to render 3D output in an IPython/Jupyter notebook. Rhett Allain in his Wired blog shows an example of using Trinkets to embed both editable VPython source code and 3D execution in one\\'s own web page.\\n\\nSection::::Objects.\\nSee the article on Python for Python syntax. This article will address several of the objects that are VPython specific. Click here for the complete documentation. The cylinder object is a good example of a simple VPython object. Here is an example of a simple cylinder as given in VPython\\'s documentation (in older VPython implementations, the module to import is \"vpython\", not \"visual\"):\\n\\nSome similar objects offered by the VPython 3D rendering engine are the cone, sphere, and box objects. In addition to solid objects, VPython offers graphing tools as well.

It is commonly used in failure analysis and non-destructive evaluation. It also has applications in biological and medical research. The semiconductor industry has found the SAM useful in detecting voids, cracks, and delaminations within microelectronic packages.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe first scanning acoustic microscope was developed in 1974 by R. A. Lemons and C. F. Quate at the Microwave Laboratory of Stanford University. Since then, many improvements to such systems have been made to enhance resolution and accuracy.\\n\\nSection::::Principles of operation.\\nScanning acoustic microscopy works by directing focused sound from a transducer at a small point on a target object. Sound hitting the object is either scattered, absorbed, reflected (scattered at 180Â°) or transmitted (scattered at 0Â°). It is possible to detect the scattered pulses travelling in a particular direction. A detected pulse informs of the presence of a boundary or object. The `time of flight' of the pulse is defined as the time taken for it to be emitted by an acoustic source, scattered by an object and received by the detector, which is usually coincident with the source. The time of flight can be used to determine the distance of the inhomogeneity from the source given knowledge of the speed through the medium.\\n\\nBased on the measurement, a value is assigned to the location investigated. The transducer (or object) is moved slightly and then insonified again. This process is repeated in a systematic pattern until the entire region of interest has been investigated. Often the values for each point are assembled into an image of the object. The contrast seen in the image is based either on the object's geometry or material composition. The resolution of the image is limited either by the physical scanning resolution or the width of the sound beam (which in turn is determined by the frequency of the sound).\\n\\nSection::::Applications.\\nSection::::Device testing.\\nSAM is used for counterfeit detection, product reliability testing, process validation, vendor qualification, quality control, failure analysis, research, and development. Detecting discontinuities in silicon is just one of the ways scanning acoustic microscopy is being used for testing in the semiconductor market.\\n\\nSection::::Medicine and biology.\\nSAM can provide data on the elasticity of cells and tissues, which can give useful information on the physical forces holding structures in a particular shape and the mechanics of structures such as the cytoskeleton. These studies are particularly valuable in investigating processes such as cell motility.\\n\\nSome work has also been performed to assess penetration depth of particles injected into skin using needle-free injection \\n\\n\", 'title': 'Scanning acoustic microscope', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7168569'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'WgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '717108', 'text': 'Tara Spencer-Nairn\\n\\nTara Spencer-Nairn (born January 6, 1978) is a Canadian actress best known for her work on the television series \"Corner Gas\".\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nSpencer-Nairn was born in Montreal, Quebec, but raised in Vancouver, British Columbia.

As a young man he was a successful sports shooter, winning an individual bronze and a team gold in the free pistol event in the 1903 World Championship held in Buenos Aires. He would receive a team silver in the 1904 edition in Lyon, France. He was the founder of Argentina\\'s National Olympic Committee. As a politician he became the leader of the anti-personalistic faction of the centrist part of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) co-founded by Yrigoyen, opposed to some of president HipÃ³lito Yrigoyen\\'s policies. In contrast to Yrigoyen\\'s popular style, Alvear belonged to the self-appointed \"aristocracy\" of Buenos Aires and never tried to hide it. He married opera singer Regina Pacini. In 1917, he was appointed Ambassador to France.\\n\\nIn 1922, Argentina\\'s president HipÃ³lito Yrigoyen designated Alvear to be his successor. During his term, the economy of Argentina reached a peak performance, which would come to an abrupt halt due to the Great Depression shortly after his mandate ended.\\n\\nAfter the coup against Yrigoyen on September 6, 1930, Alvear gained control of the party and led the unsuccessful opposition to the conservative governments that followed, including the failed revolution of 1932. As a result, he was arrested and deported to Europe. Securing an agreement to the effect from President AgustÃ­n Justo in 1935, Alvear returned to Argentina, whereby he became the UCR\\'s nominee for the presidency. Encouraged by favorable results during mid-term elections in 1936, the UCR ran a vigorous campaign ahead of the 1937 presidential election.

She appears in the now non-canon \"Legends\" series, as the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker. In the different video games, she has been voiced by Heidi Shannon, Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie. Despite not being part of the regular canon and never appearing in the film series, Mara is considered one of the most popular \"Star Wars\" characters.\\n\\nSection::::Concept and development.\\nMara Jade was introduced in the \"Star Wars Expanded Universe\", which Lucasfilm would later brand as non-canonical to the \" Star Wars\" franchise. Her first appearance was in Timothy Zahn\\'s \"Heir to the Empire\" (1991). Zahn imagined Jade as a strong, complex female character, which he found was lacking in the \"Star Wars\" universe. While competent, she is also flawed. When the \"Thrawn Trilogy\" ended in 1993 with \"The Last Command\", Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character. When he was asked to write another novel, he established two goals: \"to end the war between the New Republic and the Empire, and to get Luke Skywalker and Mara together.\" Although Lucasfilm initially resisted the idea of Luke marrying Mara, they eventually acquiesced.\\n\\nCompared to \"Star Wars\" sole iconic female character, Princess Leia, Zahn said, \"Mara has a sharper and more sarcastic manner, and of course, she had to go through the painful realization that her service had been to an evil cause. But they\\'re both women who are strong without sacrificing their femininity, a balance which I think some authors have trouble writing. Bear in mind too, that Leia was one of the first people in the New Republic who decided Mara could be trusted, which perhaps says something about their understanding of each other.\"\\n\\nIn 2006, Zahn called Mara and Grand Admiral Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created, saying that \"Mara, with her attitude and her Jedi skills, is just plain fun to write, especially when she\\'s in oppositionâor in partnershipâwith Luke.\" In a 1998 \"Star Wars Insider\" poll of fans\\' favorite \"Star Wars\" characters, Mara was the only expanded universe character to break the top 20.\\n\\nSection::::Appearances and depiction.\\nIn 2018, Zahn said that Lucasfilm had given him some creative control over the character of Mara Jade: any possible appearance of Mara in new works requires Zahn\\'s approval. Zahn also explained that the Lucasfilm Story Group also had the authority to prevent him from incorporating Mara back into the canon, and that any appearance would have to be approved by both parties. Zahn said that he would only allow her to appear if she plays an important role in the plot, and that he would block any kind of cameo. Previously, the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn, whom Zahn also created, had made the jump from \"Legends\" to canon, albeit with a slightly reworked story. Due to that, Zahn said that he hoped to find a way to bring Mara into the canon, stating \"If there was a generic, or organic, spot for her to fit into a story... I promise people, I will pitch it to the Lucasfilm story group, and then, it\\'s their decision whether to allow it or not.\"\\n\\nSection::::\"Legends\".\\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\\n\\nMara is introduced as smuggler Talon Karrde\\'s second-in-command in \"Heir to the Empire\". The novel establishes that she was previously an \"Emperor\\'s Hand\"âa special agentâfor Emperor Palpatine.\\n\\nSeveral stories depict Jade before the events in \"Heir to the Empire\", showing her training under Palpatine and executing his orders. The Thrawn trilogy depicts Mara\\'s first confrontation with Luke Skywalker, whom she has sworn to kill to avenge Palpatine\\'s death (Palpatine having sent her a faked image of Luke and Vader turning on him together, rather than Vader killing Palpatine on his own and the demand for Luke\\'s death simply motivated by Palpatine\\'s desire for revenge against his father rather than Luke himself having done anything). This was reinforced by the Emperor\\'s final telepathic command to assassinate Luke, which had plagued her thoughts since his death; upon learning this situation, Luke vowed to help Mara break Palpatine\\'s hold on her, regardless of the danger she posed to him. Towards the end of the trilogy, she turns against the Empire and resolves her anger toward Luke and silences the command without killing him, instead killing Luke\\'s \"clone\"â Luuke Skywalkerâ who had been made by the Dark Jedi Joruus C\\'baoth to challenge Luke. In doing so, she took Anakin Skywalker\\'s blue lightsaber (which Luuke was using), and used it instead of Luke\\'s green lightsaber to defeat C\\'baoth. At the close of \"The Last Command\", Luke gives her Anakin\\'s lightsaber not only because she had earned it, but because he truly wanted her to have it. Over the course of the series, Luke recognizes in Mara an underdeveloped affinity for the Force ; and although she initially resists Jedi training, she eventually becomes a Jedi Master.\\n\\nLuke and Mara develop a strong bond in Zahn\\'s \"The Hand of Thrawn Duology\"; he proposes marriage, and the two wed in Michael A. Stackpole\\'s graphic novel \"Union\". She delivers a son, Ben, during \"The New Jedi Order\" series.\\n\\nIn the \"Legacy of the Force\" series, Mara becomes suspicious of her nephew, Jacen Solo, when he sends Ben on several ethically dubious missions. Upon learning that Jacen has become a Sith apprentice, Mara vows to kill him, but Jacen ultimately kills \"her\" in \"Sacrifice\". She later appears as a Force ghost, first to Ben and then to Luke, in \"Revelation\". She also appears as a Force ghost to Cade Skywalker in the \"\" comics, set more than a century after the \"Star Wars\" films.\\n\\nMara also appears in the short story \"Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade\", by Timothy Zahn, in the anthology \"Tales from Jabba\\'s Palace\". In this story, she infiltrates Jabba the Hutt\\'s palace as a dancing girl in order to assassinate Luke Skywalker under orders of the Emperor, but misses her chance when Jabba drops him into the Rancor\\'s lair and he escapes.\\n\\nSection::::Other appearances.\\nMara was portrayed by model Shannon McRandle (as Shannon Baksa) on several cards in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.\\n\\nMeeting her was also a mission objective in the now defunct massively multiplayer online game \"Star Wars Galaxies\". She is a playable character in \",\". \"\", \"\" and \"\". She also narrates the Imperial campaign in \"\". \\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nMara Jade was chosen by IGN as the 19th top \"Star Wars\" character. IGN\\'s Jesse Schedeen also listed the character as the top 10th \"Star Wars\" hero, noting that she \"entered the Expanded Universe early, and she\\'s stuck around for so long because she\\'s just a great character\". UGO Networks called the character the seventh top \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe character, calling her complex. In 2006, Zahn called Mara and Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Mara Jade', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71789', 'cat_id': '71789', 'cat_title': \"Brazilian_BahÃÆÃÂ¡'ÃÆÃ\\xads\", 'cat_pages': '4', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718196', 'text': 'Albert Pujols\\n\\nJosÃ© Alberto Pujols AlcÃ¡ntara (born January 16, 1980) is a Dominican-American professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played 11 seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals, with whom he was a three-time National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) (, , ) and nine-time All-Star (2001, 2003â2010). He then was a one-time All-Star additionally with the Angels in 2015. A right-handed batter and thrower, Pujols stands tall and weighs .\\n\\nPujols was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to the United States in 1996. After one season of college baseball, he was selected by the Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 MLB draft. As a rookie for the Cardinals in 2001, he was unanimously voted the NL Rookie of the Year. Pujols played for the Cardinals, contributing to two World Series championships in and . After the 2011 season, Pujols became a free agent and signed a 10-year contract with the Angels.\\n\\nPujols was at the height of his career a highly regarded hitter who showed a \"combination of contact hitting ability, patience and raw power.\" He is a six-time Silver Slugger who has twice led the NL in home runs, and he has also led the NL once each in batting average, doubles and RBI. He is significantly above-average in career regular season batting average (.302), walk rate (10.9 percent) and Isolated Power (.252). He holds the MLB all-time record for most times grounded into a double play (376). With 14 seasons of 100 or more RBI produced, he is tied with Alex Rodriguez for the most in MLB history. Pujols got his 3,000th career hit in 2018, becoming the 32nd player in MLB history to do so. Pujols also became the fourth member of the 3,000-hit club to also hit 600 home runs, joining Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and Rodriguez in this exclusive club. He is a strong future candidate for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nPujols was raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a softball pitcher, but he was also an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.\\n\\nPujols played baseball at Fort Osage High School in Independence and was named an All-State athlete twice. As a senior, he was walked 55 times in protest because opposing coaches believed he was older than 18, but he still hit eight home runs in 33 at bats. One of his home runs travelled 450 feet. After graduating from high school a semester early in December 1998, he was given a baseball scholarship to Maple Woods Community College. Pujols hit a grand slam and turned an unassisted triple play in the first game of his only college season. Playing shortstop, he batted .461 with 22 home runs as a freshman before deciding to enter the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft.\\n\\nSection::::Professional baseball career.\\nSection::::Minor league career.\\nFew teams were interested in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended that his team sign Pujols, and quit his job when Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick. Pujols initially turned down a $10,000 bonus and spent the summer playing for the Hays Larks of the Jayhawk Collegiate League (a summer league in the National Baseball Congress); his total of 48 runs batted in (RBI) with the team was tied for ninth with Tyler Wasserman in Larks\\' history. When the Cardinals increased their bonus offer to $60,000, he signed.\\n\\nPujols began his minor league career in 2000 playing third base with the Peoria Chiefs of the single-A Midwest League. He batted .324 with 128 hits, 32 doubles, six triples, 17 home runs and 84 RBI, in 109 games. He finished second in the league in batting (behind Ryan Gripp), tied for ninth in doubles (with Andrew Beattie and Justin Leone), tied for fourth in triples (with six other players), tied for sixth in home runs (with Shawn McCorkle and Lance Burkhart) and sixth in RBI. He was voted the league\\'s Most Valuable Player and named to the All-Star team. Pujols also played 21 games with the Potomac Cannons in the high-A Carolina League that year, batting .284 with 23 hits, eight doubles, one triple, two home runs and 10 RBI. He finished the 2000 season with the Memphis Redbirds in the AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), and after appearing in three regular season games with them, he batted .367 in the playoffs and was named the postseason Most Valuable Player (MVP) as the Redbirds won their first PCL title.\\n\\nSection::::St. Louis Cardinals (2001â2011).\\nSection::::Early career (2001â2003).\\nDuring spring training in 2001, incumbent first baseman Mark McGwire said to Cardinals manager Tony La Russa that if he did not promote Pujols to the major league roster, \"it might be one of the worst moves you make in your career.\" La Russa later recounted the \"myth\" that Pujols only made the Opening Day roster in 2001 because Bobby Bonilla was injured. According to La Russa, he and the rest of Cardinals management were impressed enough by Pujols that they decided to promote him to the big league club even before Bonilla\\'s injury. Although the team did not require Pujols to fill any particular position, the Cardinals activated him to the Opening Day roster, and he started all season at either third base, right field, left field, or first base.\\n\\nOn Opening Day against the Colorado Rockies on April 2, he recorded his first career hit, a single against pitcher Mike Hampton in an 8â0 loss. Four days later, he had three hits and three RBI â including his first home run â against the Arizona Diamondbacks\\' Armando Reynoso in a 12â9 win. Through 2015, he was one of three players to hit 20 or more home runs in their rookie year before July, along with Wally Berger (1930) and Joc Pederson (2015).\\n\\nAt midseason, Pujols became the first Cardinals\\' rookie since Luis Arroyo in 1955 to make the All-Star Game. He finished the season batting .329 (sixth in the league) with 194 hits (fifth in the league), 47 doubles (fifth in the league), 37 home runs and 112 runs. His 37 home runs led the Cardinals, topping Jim Edmonds\\'s 30 and McGwire\\'s 29. He was named the National League (NL) Silver Slugger Award winner for the third base position, and he finished fourth in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, behind Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Luis Gonzalez. He was unanimously named the NL Rookie of the Year after setting an NL rookie record with 130 RBI (fifth in the league) and becoming the fourth MLB rookie to hit .300 with 30 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBI.\\n\\nThe Cardinals finished the 2001 season with a 93â69 record and advanced to the playoffs as the National League wild card team. The team advanced to the NL Division Series (NLDS). In Game 2 on October 10, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run home run against Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson in a 4â1 victory. The Cardinals, however, were eliminated in five games, and Pujols had just two hits in 18 at-bats.\\n\\nAfter playing several positions in 2001, Pujols spent most of 2002 in left field. He began the season batting cleanup but was moved in May to the third spot in the lineup, where he remained for the rest of his Cardinals career. Pujols hit his 30th home run and 100th RBI of the season in a 5â4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds in August, making him the sixth Cardinal to have back-to-back 30-home-run seasons and the second Cardinal (the other was Ray Jablonski) to start his career with back-to-back 100-RBI seasons. The following month, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run single against Pete Munro in a 9â3 victory over the Houston Astros that gave the Cardinals the NL Central title. Pujols finished the year batting .314 (seventh in the NL) with 185 hits (tied for fourth in the NL), 40 doubles (eighth in the NL), 34 home runs (10th in the NL), 118 runs scored (second in the NL to Sosa\\'s 122) and 127 RBI (second in the NL). He became the first player in major league history to hit over .300 with at least 30 home runs, 100 runs scored and 100 RBI in his first two seasons. Pujols finished second in MVP voting to Bonds, becoming the first Cardinal since Stan Musial to finish in the top four in MVP voting for consecutive seasons. At the end of the 2002 season, Chris Haft of \"MLB.com\" called him \"an outstanding hitter.\"\\n\\nPujols\\'s contributions helped the Cardinals finish third in home runs and second in batting average and RBI; the Cardinals\\' pitching staff also finished fourth in ERA. The Cardinals again reached the playoffs, and Pujols had three hits and three RBI in a three-game sweep of the Diamondbacks in the 2002 NLDS. The team advanced to the 2002 NL Championship Series (NLCS), but lost in five games to the San Francisco Giants. Pujols had five hits, one home run and two RBI in the series.\\n\\nFive Cardinals were named to the All-Star Game in 2003 while Pujols led the NL in votes. It was the first of eight straight seasons that Pujols would reach the All-Star Game. From July 12 to August 16, Pujols had a 30-game hitting streak, tied for the second-longest in Cardinals\\' history with Musial and behind only Rogers Hornsby\\'s 33-game streak. On July 20, Pujols hit his 100th career home run, a game-winner in a 10â7 victory over the Dodgers. He became the fourth major leaguer to hit his 100th home run in his third season, along with Ralph Kiner, Eddie Mathews and Joe DiMaggio. Pujols hit his 114th home run on September 20 in a game against the Astros, which tied him with Kiner for most home runs by a player in his first three seasons.\\n\\nIn 157 games, Pujols hit 43 home runs (fourth in the league, behind Jim Thome, Richie Sexson and Bonds) and had 124 RBI (tied with Sexson for fourth and behind Preston Wilson, Gary Sheffield and Thome). He became the youngest player since Tommy Davis in 1962 to win the NL batting title after batting .359, and he led the league in runs (137), hits (212) and doubles (51). Pujols joined Rogers Hornsby as the only players in Cardinals\\' history to record more than 40 homers and 200 hits in the same season. Though his stellar play had Cardinals\\' fans chanting \"M-V-P!\" during home games as early as June, Pujols again finished second to Bonds in MVP voting. He won his second Silver Slugger Award and first \"Sporting News\" Player of the Year Award. Pujols\\' contributions helped the Cardinals rank second in batting average and third in home runs in the NL; however, the pitching staff posted a 4.60 ERA, which was below the league average, and the Cardinals missed the playoffs.\\n\\nSection::::New contract (2004â2005).\\nAfter receiving many awards in his first three seasons, Pujols was rewarded monetarily for his accomplishments on February 20, 2004, when he signed a seven-year, $100\\xa0million contract extension with a $16\\xa0million club option for 2011 with no-trade provisions. He was moved to first base in 2004 after the Cardinals traded Tino Martinez in the offseason. On June 16, he hit a walk-off home run against Reds pitcher Mike Matthews in the 10th inning of a 4â3 victory.\\n\\nPujols\\'s highlights later in the season included a July game in which he hit five RBI and three home runs, and another in which he broke up a no-hitter by Giants pitcher Dustin Hermanson. During a September game against the Rockies, he earned his 500th RBI, joining DiMaggio and Ted Williams as the only players to have 500 RBI in their first four seasons. He said he was confident there was going to be \"a lot more.\" Although Pujols was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis during the second half of the season, he finished the season with a .331 average (fifth in the league), 196 hits (fifth), 51 doubles (second to Lyle Overbay\\'s 53), 46 home runs (tied with Adam Dunn for second behind AdriÃ¡n BeltrÃ©\\'s 48) and 123 RBI (third, behind Vinny Castilla\\'s 131 and Scott Rolen\\'s 124) in 154 games. He also led the league in runs scored, with 133. He finished third in MVP voting (behind Bonds and BeltrÃ©), joining Musial as the only Cardinals to finish in the top five in voting for at least four years in a row. He won the Silver Slugger Award at first base, the third position he won the award at. Pujols, along with teammates Edmonds and Rolen, earned the nickname \"MV3\" for their phenomenal seasons; Pujols led the three in home runs and batting average.\\n\\nThe Cardinals won the NL Central, aided by the MVP and pitcher Chris Carpenter, who won 15 games and had a 3.46 ERA his first season with the team. In Game 4 of the NLDS against the Dodgers, Pujols hit a three-run home run against Wilson Ãlvarez and had four RBI as the Cardinals won, 6â2, and took the series three games to one. In Game 6 of the NLCS, Pujols had three hits, scored three runs (including the winning run), and hit a two-run home run off Munro in a 12-inning, 6â4 victory. The Cardinals won the series in seven games, advancing to the World Series for the first time since 1987. Pujols was named the NLCS MVP after batting .500 with four home runs and nine RBI. He was one of three Cardinals to bat over .250 in the series against the Boston Red Sox (after batting .333) as the Cardinals were swept by Boston in four games.\\n\\nBy 2005, many baseball fans thought that Pujols was the best Cardinal since Musial. Pujols picked up his 100th RBI of the season on August 31, joining Williams, DiMaggio and Al Simmons as the only players with 100 RBI in their first five seasons. Pujols hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Reds on September 30, making him the third-youngest major league player to reach that milestone (behind Mel Ott and Eddie Mathews) and the second-fastest to reach it (behind Kiner). In 161 games, Pujols batted .330 (second to Derrek Lee\\'s .335 average) with 195 hits (fourth behind Lee, Miguel Cabrera and Jimmy Rollins), 38 doubles, 41 home runs (third, behind Andruw Jones\\'s 51 and Lee\\'s 46), 117 RBI (tied with Burrell for second behind Jones\\'s 128) and 129 runs scored (first in the league). For the first time in his career, he won the NL MVP award as Bonds was limited to 14 games due to an injury.\\n\\nPujols returned to the playoffs as the Cardinals won the NL Central for the second year in a row. He had five hits in nine at-bats with four runs scored and two RBI in the NLDS as the Cardinals swept the Padres. In Game 5 of the NLCS against the Astros, with the Cardinals trailing by two runs and only one out from elimination in the ninth inning, Pujols hit a game-winning three-run home run against Brad Lidge that landed on the train tracks in the back of Minute Maid Park. The Cardinals won 5â4. \"MLB.com\" writer Matthew Leach later called it \"one of the most famous playoff home runs in recent years.\" Nevertheless, the Cardinals were eliminated in Game 6 by the Astros. Pujols batted .304 with two home runs and six RBI in the series.\\n\\nSection::::Continued success and first World Series (2006â2008).\\nOver two games in April 2006, Pujols hit home runs in four consecutive plate appearances, making him the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Pujols maintained after the game that he was more concerned with winning than the numbers: \"I don\\'t look at numbers,\" he said. \"I don\\'t know. I didn\\'t know anything about [the record] until you guys brought it up. Because that\\'s not me. I don\\'t get locked in on numbers. I don\\'t get locked in on anything like that. I get locked in on seeing the ball and helping my team out to win and hopefully doing some damage out there.\"\\n\\nPujols had three hits and four RBI, including his 1,000th career hit (a home run against Jerome Williams), as the Cardinals defeated the Cubs 9â3 on April 21, 2006. On June 4, he was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career with a strained right oblique that kept him out for three weeks.\\nOn August 22, Pujols hit a three-run home run and a grand slam against John Maine in an 8â7 loss to the Mets. On September 28, with the Cardinals trailing 2â1 to the Padres in the eighth inning, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Cla Meredith, helping the Cardinals win 4â2 and end a seven-game losing streak. The win preserved the Cardinals\\' 1.5 game division lead; La Russa said afterward that it was \"the most huge of the huge ones he\\'s hit.\"\\n\\nPujols finished the season with a .331 average (third to Freddy Sanchez\\'s .344 and Cabrera\\'s .339), 177 hits, 33 doubles, 49 home runs (second to Ryan Howard\\'s 58), 137 RBI (second to Howard, 149) and 119 runs scored (tied with Matt Holliday, Hanley RamÃ­rez, and Alfonso Soriano for fifth). Of his 49 home runs, 20 accounted for a game-winning RBI, breaking Willie Mays\\' single-season record set in 1962. He finished second to Howard in MVP voting and won the NL Gold Glove Award for first base. He won his first of four consecutive Fielding Bible Awards for the first base position.\\n\\nLed by Pujols and Carpenter, the Cardinals won the NL Central and reached the playoffs for the third year in a row. In Game 1 of the NLDS against the Padres, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Jake Peavy as the Cardinals won 5â1. He had a game-winning RBI against David Wells and had three hits in Game 2 as the Cardinals won 2â0. He batted .333 with a home run and an RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Padres in four games. In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Mets, Pujols scored three runs as the Cardinals won 9â6. He batted .318 with one home run and one RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Mets in seven games.\\n\\nIn Game 1 of the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Justin Verlander as the Cardinals won 4â2. In Game 5, he made a sprawling, flip-from-his-back play to rob PlÃ¡cido Polanco of a hit as the Cardinals clinched the series giving Pujols his first career World Series ring.\\nNear the beginning of the 2007 season in an April 22 game against the Cubs, Pujols hit a game-winning three-run home run against Ryan Dempster in the 10th inning of a 12â9 victory, tying Ken Boyer for second all-time on the Cardinals\\' home run list with his 255th. Pujols finished the season with 185 hits, 38 doubles and 103 RBI (a career-low). He was among the league leaders in batting average (.327, sixth) and home runs (32, tied with Carlos Lee and Chris Young) for 10. He scored 99 runs, ending his streak of seasons with at least 30 home runs, a .300 average, 100 runs scored and 100 RBI, at six. He grounded into a major-league leading 27 double plays. He finished ninth in MVP voting, the first year he had finished outside the top five in his career.\\n\\nPujols began 2008 by reaching base in 42 straight games, the longest streak to open a season since Derek Jeter reached base in the first 53 games of 1999. On June 11, he was placed on the DL with a strained left calf muscle. Although he was expected to miss three weeks, he was activated from the DL on June 26. Pujols hit his 300th home run against Bob Howry on July 4 in a 2â1 loss to the Cubs. He said after the game that to him it was \"just another homer that goes out of the park. I\\'m happy to do it in front of our fansâthey were waiting for it.\"\\nOn September 11, in a 3â2 loss to the Cubs, Pujols hit his 100th RBI of the season against Rich Harden, making him the third player in major league history to start his career with eight seasons of at least 100 RBI (along with Simmons and Williams). He regretted that the milestone came in a loss, saying, \"I wish it would have come with a great win. It would have been more special.\" In 148 games in 2008, Pujols batted .357 (second to Chipper Jones\\'s .364 average) with 187 hits (third, behind Reyes\\'s 204 and David Wright\\'s 189), 44 doubles (tied with Stephen Drew and Aramis RamÃ­rez for fourth in the league behind Berkman and Nate McLouth\\'s 46 and Corey Hart\\'s 45), 37 home runs (tied with Ryan Braun and Ryan Ludwick for fourth in the league behind Howard\\'s 48, Dunn\\'s 40, and Delgado\\'s 38), 116 RBI (fourth, behind Howard\\'s 146, Wrights 124 and Adrian Gonzalez\\'s 119) and 100 runs scored. He grounded into a National League-leading 27 double plays. Pujols won his second NL MVP Award, and he won the Silver Slugger Award for the fourth time in his career. He was named \"The Sporting News\" Player of the Year for the second time in his career. For his work off the field, he was named the 2008 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award. He considered having Tommy John surgery after the season but underwent nerve transposition surgery on his right elbow instead to ease discomfort.\\n\\nSection::::Later career and second World Series (2009â2011).\\nOn April 25, 2009, Pujols picked up his 1,000th career RBI with a 441-foot grand slam against David Patton in an 8â2 victory over the Cubs. \"I hit that ball as good as I can hit a ball,\" he said after the game. On July 3, he hit his 10th career grand slam against Weathers in a 7â4 victory over the Reds, breaking Musial\\'s record for most grand slams by a Cardinal. The grand slam was also his 350th career home run, making him the third-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey, Jr.. He received the highest number of votes in NL history for the All-Star Game that year.\\n\\nPujols had four hits, three runs scored and five RBI on August 4, including a grand slam against Sean Green which tied the NL record for most grand slams in a season (five), in a 10-inning, 12â7 victory over the Mets. In 160 games, Pujols batted .327 (third, behind RamÃ­rez\\'s .342 and Pablo Sandoval\\'s .330) with 186 hits (sixth), 45 doubles (second to Miguel Tejada\\'s 46), 47 home runs (first), 135 RBI (third behind Fielder and Howard\\'s 141) and 124 runs scored (first). He was unanimously named the NL MVP for the third time, tying Musial as the Cardinals\\' leader in that category. For the fifth time in his career, he won the Silver Slugger Award. He won the \"Sporting News\" MLB Player of the Year award for the second consecutive year, joining Williams and Joe Morgan as the only players to win it in back-to-back years. For the fourth year in a row, he won the Fielding Bible Award for first base.\\n\\nAided by the mid-season acquisition of Matt Holliday (who replaced Ryan Ludwick as the cleanup hitter) and the emergence of Adam Wainwright (who led the NL in wins), the Cardinals returned to the playoffs after a two-year hiatus. In the NLDS against the Dodgers, Pujols batted .300 with one RBI as the Cardinals were swept in three games. Following the postseason, Pujols had surgery to remove five bone spurs from his right elbow. The Cardinals called the surgery a \"success,\" and Dr. James Andrews decided that Pujols did not need Tommy John surgery at that time.\\n\\nFor April 2010, Pujols earned his first Pepsi Clutch Performer of the Month Award. He batted .348, 1.270 OPS, three home runs and 14 RBI with runners on base. Further, in situations with his team leading by one run, tied, or having the potential tying run on base, at bat, or on deck after the seventh inning (\"late-and-close\"), he batted .583 (7-for-12) with a home run, two doubles, three RBI and five runs scored.\\n\\nOn June 29, 2010, in an 8â0 victory over the Diamondbacks, Pujols hit five RBI and hit two home runs against Dontrelle Willis for his 37th career multihomer game, which tied Musial\\'s franchise record for multihomer games. \"It\\'s pretty special,\" he said of tying Musial. \"I\\'m blessed to have the opportunity to be compared sometimes with him.\"\\n\\nOn August 26, he hit his 400th career home run against Jordan Zimmermann in a 13-inning, 11â10 loss to the Nationals. He became the third-youngest player to reach the milestoneâbehind Griffey, Jr. and Rodriguezâand he became the fourth-quickest player by at bats to reach the milestone (behind McGwire, Babe Ruth, Harmon Killebrew, and Thome). On September 11, in a 12-inning 6â3 loss to Atlanta, Pujols had three RBI and reached 100 RBI for the 10th consecutive year with a two-run double against Tommy Hanson. Only Simmons has a longer streak of 100 RBI seasons at the beginning of a career, with 11. Pujols joined Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Rodriguez in having 10 consecutive seasons of 100 or more RBI at any time in their career. Foxx and Rodriguez are the only two players besides Pujols to have 10 consecutive years of 30 home runs and 100 RBI. The next day, in a 7â3 victory over the Braves, he passed Musial to be the all-time Cardinals\\' leader in multi-home run games when he hit two home runs against Tim Hudson for the 38th time in a game.\\n\\nIn 159 games, Pujols batted .312 (sixth) with 183 hits (fifth) and 39 doubles (tied for eighth with Marlon Byrd); he led the league in runs scored (115), home runs (42) and RBI (118). He won his second Gold Glove Award for first base, and he won the NL First Base Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time. He finished second in the NL MVP voting to Joey Votto, who said he was \"shocked\" that Pujols only got one first-place vote.\\n\\nPujols and the Cardinals set a deadline for the start of 2011 spring training for contract extension negotiations but failed to reach an agreement. After Pujols struggled in his first 30 games of the season in batting .231, he batted .316 with 30 home runs in his final 117 games. Against the Cubs, he hit consecutive extra-inning walk-off home runs on June 4 and 5 for the first time since Albert Belle in 1995. Carpenter noted after the game that Pujols\\' slump earlier in the year was over: \"He continues to do great things, there\\'s no doubt about it,\" he said. \"The things that he\\'s done the last few days have been just like the old Albert.\"\\n\\nOn June 19 against the Royals, Wilson Betemit collided with Pujols, inducing a small fracture his left wrist and keeping him inactive until July 5. On July 30, in a 9â2 victory over the Cubs, he got his 2,000th career hit against Carlos MÃ¡rmol, becoming the fifth Cardinal to reach 2,000 hits and 12th-fastest major leaguer by games to reach the milestone. In the Cardinals\\' final game of the season, against the Astros on September 28, he had the game-winning RBI against Brett Myers in the 8â0 victory, helping the Cardinals overcome a 10.5-game deficit to Atlanta to win the Wild Card. Pujols finished the season with 173 hits (tied for ninth with Aramis RamÃ­rez), 29 doubles (a career-low), and 105 runs scored (tied for third with Justin Upton behind Ryan Braun\\'s 109 and Matt Kemp\\'s 115). He saw his streak of seasons batting at least .300 with 30 home runs and 100 RBI snapped when he hit 37 home runs (third, behind Fielder\\'s 38 and Kemp\\'s 39), but batted .299 with 99 RBI (seventh); however, only three other players in the major leagues matched him in those categories (JosÃ© Bautista, Fielder, and Kemp), causing Tyler Kepner of \"The New York Times\" to write, \"Even when Pujols struggles, he excels.\" He grounded into a major-league leading 29 double plays. He was fifth in MVP voting.\\n\\nIn Game 2 of the NLDS against the Phillies on October 2, Pujols had a game-winning RBI single against Cliff Lee in the 5â4 victory. He batted .350 with one RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Phillies in five games. In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Brewers, he had four hits, three runs scored, one home run and five RBI, in a 12â3 victory. He batted .478 with two home runs and nine RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Brewers in six games.\\n\\nOn October 22, in Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols became the first player to get at least four hits, two home runs and five RBI in a World Series game in a 16â7 victory over the Rangers. Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored and six RBI in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in baseball history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), became the first player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBI in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBI the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent for the first time in his career.\\n\\nSection::::Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels (2012âpresent).\\nThree teams were reported to be interested in Pujols during the offseason: the Cardinals, the Miami Marlins, and the Los Angeles Angels. The Cardinals offered Pujols a 10-year, $210\\xa0million deal (with $30\\xa0million deferred), but Pujols rejected it. His wife explained on a radio talk show that they were \"insulted\" and \"confused\" that the Cardinals had initially offered Pujols a five-year deal. The Marlins reportedly offered Pujols a 10-year contract too, but on December 8, he signed a 10-year deal with the Angels worth around $254\\xa0million. The contract offered by the Marlins was reportedly around the value as that offered by the Angels. However, the Marlins refused to include a no trade clause in the contract.\\n\\nSection::::2012.\\nPujols did not perform very well to begin the 2012 season, batting .217 with no home runs and four RBI in the month of April. Soon after the Angels called up top prospect Mike Trout and fired hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, Pujols\\'s numbers began to rise, as he batted .323 with 13 home runs from May 15 through the All-Star Break. On July 31, he hit two home runs against Derek Holland in a 6â2 victory over the Rangers. After the game, Holland observed that Pujols had \"definitely turned it around, no doubt about it... He had a slow start, but he\\'s picked it up. He\\'s a great hitter...\" On August 14, Pujols had four RBIs, including a game-winning three-run home run against Ubaldo JimÃ©nez in a 9â6 victory over the Cleveland Indians. \\n\\nIn 153 games, Pujols batted .285 (at the time, a career low) with 173 hits, 50 doubles (second to Alex Gordon\\'s 51), 30 home runs, 105 RBIs (7th in AL), and 85 runs scored.\\n\\nSection::::2013.\\nOn August 19, 2013, Pujols was ruled out for the remainder of the 2013 season after suffering a foot injury. Pujols had by far the worst season of his career in 2013, failing to play at least 100 games for the first time in his career. Pujols also posted career worsts in hits, runs scored, doubles, home runs, RBI, walks, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS. Overall in 99 games, Pujols batted .258 with 101 hits, 19 doubles, 17 home runs, 64 RBI, and 49 runs scored.\\n\\nIn August 2013, former Cardinals player Jack Clark accused Pujols of using performance-enhancing drugs on his radio show on WGNU in St. Louis. Clark served as the Cardinals\\' hitting coach during the early part of Pujols\\'s tenure in St. Louis. On the morning of August 9, Pujols issued a statement adamantly denying that he had ever taken PEDs. He denounced Clark\\'s allegations as \"irresponsible and reckless,\" and threatened to sue Clark and WGNU over the allegations. Partly due to legal threats from Pujols, InsideSTL Enterprises, which owns WGNU\\'s weekday airtime under a time brokerage agreement, cut ties with Clark. On October 4, 2013, Pujols filed a defamation lawsuit against Clark. In response, Clark challenged Pujols to both take polygraph tests to resolve who is telling the truth. However, on February 10, 2014, Clark apologized and retracted his accusations against Pujols, saying he had \"no knowledge whatsoever\" that Pujols ever used PEDs. \"During a heated discussion on air, I misspoke,\" Clark said. In return, Pujols dropped the suit.\\n\\nSection::::2014.\\nOn April 22, 2014, Pujols hit his 499th and 500th home runs of his career off of Taylor Jordan in a game versus the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Pujols became the 26th player ever to reach the 500 home run mark, as well as the third youngest to reach it. He also became the first player to hit career home runs 499 and 500 in the same game. Nationals Park is the same ballpark where he hit his 400th career home run in the 2010 season. Participating in the longest game of the year in MLB, and the longest in the history of Angel Stadium, Pujols ended a 19-inning, 6:31 contest against the Red Sox with a solo home run for a 5â4 final score. It was also his first walk-off home run as an Angel and first since June 2011. On September 6, against the Minnesota Twins, Pujols collected his 2,500th career hit, a two-run go-ahead double off of Jared Burton in the 9th inning. He also passed the 1,500 run mark in the same game. In the process, he became the fifth player in major league history with 2,500 hits and 500 home runs while maintaining a .310 lifetime batting average (the others were Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, and Manny Ramirez). For the season, he batted .272 and grounded into an American League-leading 28 double plays. After the 2014 season, Pujols led all active players in doubles, with 561.\\n\\nAfter the season, Pujols traveled to Japan to join a team of MLB All-Stars playing against All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the 2014 Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.\\n\\nSection::::2015.\\nBefore the 2015 season, Pujols enjoyed his first offseason in his time with the Angels in which he was both free of injury or recuperation from injury. However, his offensive production lagged behind his career levels the first month of the season. By the end of April, Pujols was batting .208 with three home runs and nine RBI in 86 plate appearances. While it was suggested that this was because of older age, or his recent poor health, it seemed to be simply due to bad luck. The next month, Pujols\\' offensive production had started to come around. Between May 28 and June 22 he batted .356 with 15 homers, 30 RBI and a 1.326 OPS. At this time, he was leading the American League in home runs with 23, and was on pace to hit more than 50.\\n\\nAfter batting .303/.395/.737 with 13 home runs in June 2015, Pujols was named AL Player of the Month for the first time and seventh overall monthly award. His home run total led the major leagues and 73 total bases tied Manny Machado for first in the AL. Remarkably, his batting average on balls in play was .218, significantly lower than the league average of about .300.\\n\\nSelected to the 2015 All Star Game, Pujols was announced as a reserve for the American League. Due to an injury just days earlier with Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera, Pujols instead started at first base. It was his 10th overall selection to the midsummer classic, and first as a member of the Angels.\\n\\nOn September 22, Pujols hit his 556th career home run to pass RamÃ­rez for sole possession of 14th place on the all-time career home run leaderboard. In the last game of the season, on October 4, Pujols hit his 40th home run, the seventh time he had done so in a season. Among active MLB players, he trailed only Alex Rodriguez, with eight. With Trout also hitting 40 home runs, the 2015 Angels became just the 31st team in MLB history with multiple players to hit 40+ home runs in a season. For the season, he batted .244/.307/.480, and he had the lowest batting average on balls in play (.217) of all major league players.\\n\\nSection::::2016.\\nOn April 30, 2016, Pujols became the 85th player to make 10,000 career plate appearances. On May 2, Pujols became the 20th player all-time to amass 5,000 career total bases. On August 17, Pujols joined Barry Bonds as the only other player to be intentionally walked over 300 times. Playing the Toronto Blue Jays on August 25, he reached 100 RBI for the 13th time in his career, the fifth player to do so.\\n\\nWhile playing Cincinnati on August 29, Pujols hit his 26th home run and 103rd RBI of the season. The home run tied him with Frank Robinson for ninth place on the all-time home run list at 586, and allowed him to become the seventh player all-time with 1,200 career extra base hits, and the 21st to reach 1,800 RBI. On September 16, Pujols became the 16th player all-time to reach 600 career doubles. \\n\\nHe batted .268 for the season. He tied for 2nd in the AL in double plays grounded into, with 24. For the season, he had the second-slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.6 feet/second.\\n\\nSection::::2017.\\nOn June 3, 2017, Pujols became the ninth player in Major League history to hit at least 600 home runs, when he hit a grand slam against the Minnesota Twins. He was the fourth-youngest player to achieve the feat (behind Alex Rodriguez, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron), and the first to hit a grand slam for his 600th home run. On August 10, Pujols became the 37th player all-time to amass 11,000 career plate appearances. \\n\\nFor the season, Pujols played in 149 games and had 593 at bats but set career-lows in batting average (.241), on base percentage (.286), slugging percentage (.386), doubles (17), and walks (37), while leading the majors by grounding into 26 double plays. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 21.8 feet/second.\\n\\nSection::::2018.\\nOn May 4, Albert Pujols recorded his 3,000th major league hit, against Mike Leake of the Seattle Mariners. On June 10, Pujols surpassed Stan Musial\\'s career RBI total of 1,951, moving into seventh place all-time for that category. On June 18, he became the 29th player all-time to amass 10,000 career at-bats.\\n\\nOn July 12, Pujols hit his 630th career home run, moving into a tie with Ken Griffey Jr. for sixth place all-time for that category. The next day, Pujols was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to left knee inflammation. He hit a single on August 10 for his 1,000th hit as an Angel, becoming the ninth player to record 1,000 hits in both the American League and National League. He had surgery on his left knee in August, ending his season, and on his right elbow to remove a bone spur in September.\\n\\nIn 2018 he batted .245/.289/.411 with 19 home runs, and 64 RBIs (matching the lowest season total of his career). He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players for the second consecutive year, at 22.2 feet/second. He was the sixth-oldest player in the American League.\\n\\nSection::::Playing style.\\nPujols\\'s swing has been praised for its consistency. \"It\\'s the same swing every time,\" former teammate Lance Berkman once said. \"He has the ability to repeat his swing over and over and over, which leads to him being very consistent,\" Cardinals\\' video coordinator Chad Blair said. \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as \"quick\" and \"quiet.\" Pujols uses a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but he uses a 33-ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when he swings. He has credited his hitting ability partly to guessing what pitchers will do: \\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nPujols married his wife, Deidre, on January 1, 2000. They have five children: Isabella (Deidre\\'s daughter from a previous relationship), Albert, Jr., Sophia, Ezra and Esther Grace. During the offseason, they live in St. Louis. Albert and his wife are supporters of people with Down syndrome, a condition Isabella was born with. In 2007, Pujols became a U.S. citizen, scoring a perfect 100 on his citizenship test.\\n\\nPujols is close friends with third baseman PlÃ¡cido Polanco, a former teammate with the Cardinals. Polanco has called Pujols his \"closest friend in baseball,\" and Pujols is the godfather to Polanco\\'s son, Ishmael. Pujols is also friends with Robinson CanÃ³, who selected Mark Trumbo for the 2012 Home Run Derby after Pujols asked him to.\\n\\nIn 2009, Pujols donated money to the Mike Coolbaugh Memorial Tournament, allowing the event to occur after a sponsor backed out. On August 28, 2010, Pujols and La Russa attended Glenn Beck\\'s Restoring Honor rally in Washington, D.C., after being assured by Beck that the rally was not political. During the rally, Pujols was presented with a medal for his off-the-field efforts.\\n\\nSection::::Business ventures.\\nIn 2006, Pujols and the Hanon family opened Pujols 5 Westport Grill, a restaurant located in Westport Plaza of Maryland Heights, Missouri. A 10-foot, 1,100-lb. statue of Pujols was dedicated on November 2, 2011, outside the restaurant. An anonymous donor commissioned sculptor Harry Weber to create the statue, which belongs to the Pujols Family Foundation. After Pujols signed with the Angels, the restaurant was renamed the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame Grill.\\n\\nIn 2008, Pujols teamed up with St. Louis Soccer United, a group looking to bring a Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise to the St. Louis area. However, the group\\'s bid for a franchise was unsuccessful, and a USL team (Saint Louis FC) was formed .\\n\\nSection::::Christianity.\\nPujols and his wife are Christians. He became a Christian on November 13, 1998, influenced in part by Deidre and his grandmother. \\n\\nDuring his tenure with the Cardinals, Pujols and his family attended West County Community Church, a Southern Baptist church in Wildwood, Missouri.\\n\\nSection::::Pujols Family Foundation.\\nIn 2005, Albert and Deidre Pujols launched the Pujols Family Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to their \"commitment to faith, family and others.\" The organization promotes awareness of Down syndrome and works to support those who have it and their families, aids the poor in the Dominican Republic, and supports people with disabilities and/or life-threatening illnesses. Among other activities, the foundation hosts events for people with Down syndrome. The foundation gave the Down Syndrome Association of Greater St. Louis the resources to open an office and hire staff. In 2009, the Albert Pujols Wellness Center for Adults with Down Syndrome opened in Chesterfield, Missouri; Pujols was present at the opening on November 18. The foundation hosts an annual \"All Stars Basketball Game\" with down syndrome players at Missouri Baptist University.\\n\\nPujols has taken several trips to the Dominican Republic, by taking supplies as well as a team of doctors and dentists to the poor who need medical care. The Pujols Family Foundation also holds an annual golf tournament to raise money to send dentists to the Dominican Republic.\\n\\nSection::::Accomplishments.\\nThrough 2018, Pujols ranked in the top 10 players in major league history in four career statistical categories: home runs (sixth), runs batted in (seventh), total bases (ninth), and doubles (10th). He also holds the all-time career record for Grounding Into a Double Play with 374. At the end of the 2018 season, he ranked among active players ninth in batting average (.302), second in slugging percentage (.554), and fourth in on-base plus slugging (.936). Through 2018, he ranked first among active players in doubles, home runs, RBI and runs scored. Pujols has a .994 fielding percentage at first base through 2018 (13th among active first basemen), led active first basemen in career errors with 106, and set the major league single-season record for assists with 185 in 2009.\\n\\nPujols is in the top 10 in several Cardinals\\' statistics. He is second to Musial in doubles (455), home runs (445) and RBI (1,329). He is seventh in games (1,705), seventh in batting average (.328), third in runs scored (1,291, behind Musial and Lou Brock), and fourth in hits (2,073, behind Musial, Brock and Hornsby). He also is in the top 10 in several single-season Cardinals\\' records. His 137 runs scored in 2003 are tied for seventh with Tommy McCarthy, his 51 doubles in 2003 and 2004 are tied with Musial for sixth, he holds five of the top 10 Cardinals\\' home run totals, and his 137 RBI in 2006 are tied for seventh with Jim Bottomley, Johnny Mize and Joe Torre.\\n\\nPujols has earned praise from many of his fellow players and coaches. In 2008, he was named the most feared hitter in baseball in a poll of all 30 MLB managers. La Russa has called him \"the best player I\\'ve ever managed.\" Votto referred to him as \"one of the greatest hitters of all time.\" Larry Walker called him \"a great hitter,\" and Brendan Ryan said, \"He\\'s the best there is.\" Fernando ViÃ±a said, while Pujols was with the Cardinals, \"He\\'s the face of the Cardinals.\"\\n\\n', 'title': 'Albert Pujols', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718196'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718354', 'text': 'Yibin\\n\\nYibin (; Sichuanese Pinyin: nyibin; Sichuanese pronunciation: ) is a prefecture-level city in the southeastern part of Sichuan province, China, located at the junction of the Min and Yangtze Rivers. Its population was 4,471,840 inhabitants according to the 2010 census of whom 836,340 lived in the built-up area made of Cuiping District.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nHuman habitation of Yibin dates back at least 4,000 years. Yibin was established as a county in the Han dynasty (206 BC â AD 220). Under the Ming and Qing, the town and its hinterland was known as Xuzhou Commandery \"XÃ¹zhÅufÇ\"), which was variously romanized as Suifu, Suifoo, and Suchow. Its population around 1907 was estimated at 50,000.\\n\\nSection::::Geography and climate.\\nYibin is located in the southeast portion of Sichuan at the southern end of the Sichuan Basin, bordering Zhaotong (Yunnan) to the south, Luzhou to the east, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Leshan to the west, and Zigong to the north, and has a total area is . The city ranges in latitude from 27Â° 50\\'â29Â° 16\\' N, and in longitude from 103Â° 36\\'â105Â° 20\\' E, stretching east-west and north-south.\\n\\nThe city is located at the confluence of the Min and Yangtze Rivers. Above Yibin, the Yangtze is also known as the Jinsha River. Below Yibin, the Yangtze is known in Chinese as the \"Chang Jiang\" or \"Long River.\"\\n\\nAs with the rest of the Sichuan Basin, Yibin has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen \"Cwa\") with high humidity year-round; winters are short and mild while summers long, hot, and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July and August; the annual mean is . Despite its location in the Yangtze River valley, it is still cooler than Chongqing, located further downstream, in its warmest months. Frost is uncommon and the frost-free period lasts 347 days. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 10% in December and January to 42% in August, the city receives only 1,018 hours of bright sunshine annually; Yibin has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, lower than even nearby Chengdu and Chongqing. Spring (MarchâApril) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (OctoberâNovember).\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nThe city\\'s industry focuses on electronics, food products, and power generation. It also produces paper, silk, and leather products. The surrounding region is rich in agricultural resources, growing rice, barley, oil seeds, sesame, and tea.\\n\\nThe largest employer in Yibin is Wuliangye, a company best known for Wuliangye, a brand of sorghum-based distilled spirits known as baijiu. The Wuliangye Group grew from a small company employing just 300 people in 1977 into a large company employing over 20,000 on a seven square kilometer plant. According to an August 2005 article in a securities weekly, the Wuliangye Group is 72% state owned and provides 70% of the revenues of Yibin City, a major regional center at the head of the Yangtze in southeastern Sichuan. In 2004 6,225 retired military worked for the company, out of a total work force of over 20,000. One third of top management positions are held by retired members of the military. Unsuccessful efforts to diversify its business, poor transparency and a murky ownership pictures are among the company\\'s problems today. However, liquor is not the sole product of the WuLiangye Group. It also provides the specialized high-tech anti-counterfeit packaging and printing business and engineering services. Wuliangye now contributes about 60% of Yibin\\'s GDP.\\n\\nSection::::Transportation.\\nThe region\\'s natural waterways provide transportation links with the surrounding area, and Yibin is also connected to Chongqing and Chengdu by rail and express highway. Yibin\\'s proximity to the Yunnan and Guizhou borders also means that transportation to the provinces is available by rail and by bus.\\n\\nYibin has three and ten .\\n\\nYibin Airport offers flights to Beijing, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Kunming, Lhasa, Sanya, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xi\\'an, and Yichang.\\n\\nSection::::Tourism.\\nThere are several hot springs near Yibin, plus many other tourist attractions. Such attractions include the Bamboo Sea in Changning County and the Xingwen Stone Forest. Cuiping mountain in the centre of the city provides wonderful views of Yibin.

The language of Uzbeks, it is spoken by some 33 million native speakers in Uzbekistan and elsewhere in Central Asia.\\n\\nUzbek belongs to the Eastern Turkic, or Karluk, branch of the Turkic language family. External influences include Persian, Arabic and Russian. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel to , a feature that was influenced by Persian.\\n\\nSection::::Name.\\nIn the language itself, Uzbek is \\' or \\'. In Arabic script, and .\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nTurkic speakers probably settled the Amu Darya, Syr Darya and Zarafshan river basins since at least 600â700 CE, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of Eastern Iranian languages who previously inhabited Sogdia, Bactria and Khwarezm. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 9thâ12th centuries, who were a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yaghma and other tribes.\\n\\nUzbek can be considered the direct descendant or a later form of Chagatai, the language of great Turkic Central Asian literary development in the realm of Chagatai Khan, Timur (Tamerlane), and the Timurid dynasty (including the early Mughal rulers of India). The language was championed by Ali-Shir Nava\\'i in the 15th and 16th centuries. Nava\\'i was the greatest representative of Chagatai language literature. He significantly contributed to the development of the Chagatai language and its direct descendant Uzbek and is widely considered to be the founder of Uzbek literature. Ultimately based on the Karluk variant of the Turkic languages, Chagatai contained large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords. By the 19th century it was rarely used for literary composition, but disappeared only in the early 20th century.\\n\\nThe term \"Uzbek\" as applied to language has meant different things at different times. Prior to 1921 \"Uzbek\" and \"Sart\" were considered to be different dialects:\\n\\nIn Khanate of Khiva, Sarts spoke a highly Oghuz Turkified form of Karluk Turkic. After 1921 the Soviet regime abolished the term \"Sart\" as derogatory, and decreed that henceforth the entire settled Turkic population of Turkestan would be known as \"Uzbeks\", even though many had no Uzbek tribal heritage.\\n\\nHowever, the standard written language that was chosen for the new republic in 1924, despite the protests of Uzbek Bolsheviks such as Fayzulla Khodzhayev, was not pre-revolutionary \"Uzbek\" but the \"Sart\" language of the Samarkand region. Edward A. Allworth argued that this \"badly distorted the literary history of the region\" and was used to give authors such as the 15th century author Ali-Shir Nava\\'i an Uzbek identity. All three dialects continue to exist within modern spoken Uzbek.\\n\\nSection::::Writing systems.\\nUzbek has been written in a variety of scripts throughout history:\\n\\nDespite the official status of the Latin script in Uzbekistan, the use of Cyrillic is still widespread, especially in advertisements and signs. In newspapers, scripts may be mixed, with headlines in Latin and articles in Cyrillic. The Arabic script is no longer used in Uzbekistan except symbolically in limited texts or for the academic studies of Chagatai (Old Uzbek).\\n\\nIn the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, where there is an Uzbek minority, the Arabic is still used.\\n\\nIn Afghanistan, the traditional Arabic orthography is still used.\\n\\nSection::::Grammar.\\nSection::::Phonology.\\nSection::::Vowels.\\nStandard Uzbek has six vowel phonemes:\\n\\nSection::::Morphology and syntax.\\nAs a Turkic language, Uzbek is null subject, agglutinative and has no articles and no noun classes (gender or otherwise). The word order is subjectâobjectâverb (SOV). Words are usually oxytones (i.e. the last syllable is stressed), but certain endings and suffixal particles are not stressed.\\n\\nIn Uzbek, there are two main categories of words:\\n\\nUzbek uses the following verbal suffixes:\\n\\nThe present and future tenses are both expressed with the \"-a\" and \"-y\" suffixes.\\n\\nNouns take the \"-ni\" suffix as an indefinite article. Unsuffixed nouns are understood as definite.\\n\\nSection::::Word order.\\nThe word order in the Uzbek language is subjectâobjectâverb (SOV), which means that, unlike in English, the object comes before the verb and the verb is the last element of the sentence. \\nSection::::Number of speakers.\\nEstimates of the number of speakers of Uzbek vary widely. The Swedish encyclopedia \"Nationalencyklopedin\" estimates the number of native speakers to be 30 million,\\nand the \"CIA World Factbook\" estimates 25 million. Other sources estimate the number of speakers of Uzbek to be 21 million in Uzbekistan, 3.4 million in Afghanistan, 900,000 in Tajikistan, 800,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 500,000 in Kazakhstan, 300,000 in Turkmenistan, and 300,000 in Russia.\\n\\nSection::::Loan words.\\nThe influence of Islam, and by extension, Arabic, is evident in Uzbek loanwords. There is also a residual influence of Russian, from the time when Uzbeks were under the rule of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Most importantly, Uzbek vocabulary, phraseology and pronunciation has been heavily influenced by Persian through its historic roots. Uzbek has been significantly influenced by Persian and it also influenced Tajik (a variety of Persian). Among Turkic languages, perhaps Uzbek is the most influenced language by Persian.\\n\\nSection::::Dialects.\\nThe Uzbek language has many dialects, varying widely from region to region. However, there is a commonly understood dialect which is used in mass media and in most printed materials. Among the most-widespread dialects are the Tashkent dialect, Uzbek dialect, the Ferghana dialect, the Khorezm dialect, the Chimkent-Turkestan dialect, and the Surkhandarya dialect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Uzbek language', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71836', 'cat_id': '71836', 'cat_title': 'Brazilian_adult_models', 'cat_pages': '2', 'cat_subcats': '2', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718434', 'text': 'Hamilton Island\\n\\nHamilton Island may refer to:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hamilton Island', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718434'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718685', 'text': \"Henry Garrioch\\n\\nSir William Henry Garrioch (4 May 1916 â 18 February 2008) was the Acting Governor-General of Mauritius from 31 October 1977 until 23 March 1978.\\n\\nSection::::Legal career.\\nGarrioch joined the Colonial Service in 1936 and was subsequently appointed a First Grade Clerk in 1946, when he was picked to be a judge's secretary.

This hypothesis proposes that instead of segregating their DNA during mitosis in a random manner, adult stem cells divide their DNA asymmetrically, and retain a distinct template set of DNA strands (parental strands) in each division. By retaining the same set of template DNA strands, adult stem cells would pass mutations arising from errors in DNA replication on to non-stem cell daughters that soon terminally differentiate (end mitotic divisions and become a functional cell). Passing on these replication errors would allow adult stem cells to reduce their rate of accumulation of mutations that could lead to serious genetic disorders such as cancer.\\n\\nAlthough evidence for this mechanism exists, whether it is a mechanism acting in adult stem cells in vivo is still controversial.\\n\\nSection::::Methods.\\nTwo main assays are used to detect immortal DNA strand segregation: label-retention and label-release pulse/chase assays.\\n\\nIn the label-retention assay, the goal is to mark \\'immortal\\' or parental DNA strands with a DNA label such as tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). These types of DNA labels will incorporate into the newly synthesized DNA of dividing cells during S phase. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they have not yet delineated an immortal DNA strand. During these conditions, the adult stem cells are either dividing \"symmetrically\" (thus with each division a new \\'immortal\\' strand is determined and in at least one of the stem cells the immortal DNA strand will be marked with DNA label), or the adult stem cells have \"not yet been determined\" (thus their precursors are dividing symmetrically, and once they differentiate into adult stem cells and choose an \\'immortal\\' strand, the \\'immortal strand\\' will already have been marked). Experimentally, adult stem cells are undergoing symmetric divisions during growth and after wound healing, and are not yet determined at neonatal stages. Once the immortal DNA strand is labelled and the adult stem cell has begun or resumed asymmetric divisions, the DNA label is chased out. In symmetric divisions (most mitotic cells), DNA is segregating randomly and the DNA label will be diluted out to levels below detection after five divisions. If, however, cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, then all the labeled DNA will continue to co-segregate with the adult stem cell, and after five (or more) divisions will still be detected within the adult stem cell. These cells are sometimes called label-retaining cells (LRCs).\\n\\nIn the label-release assay, the goal is to mark the newly synthesized DNA that is normally passed on to the daughter (non-stem) cell. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they are dividing \"asymmetrically.\" Under conditions of homeostasis, adult stem cells should be dividing asymmetrically so that the same number of adult stem cells is maintained in the tissue compartment. After pulsing for long enough to label all the newly replicated DNA, the DNA label is chased out (each DNA replication now incorporates unlabeled nucleotides) and the adult stem cells are assayed for loss of the DNA label after two cell divisions. If cells are using a random segregation mechanism, then enough DNA label should remain in the cell to be detected. If, however, the adult stem cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, they are obligated to retain the unlabeled \\'immortal\\' DNA, and will release all the newly synthesized labeled DNA to their differentiating daughter cells in two divisions.\\n\\nSome scientists have combined the two approaches, by first using one DNA label to label the immortal strands, allowing to adult stem cells to begin dividing asymmetrically, and then using a different DNA label to label the newly synthesized DNA. Thus, the adult stem cells will retain one DNA label and release the other within two divisions.\\n\\nSection::::Evidence.\\nEvidence for the immortal DNA strand hypothesis has been found in various systems. One of the earliest studies by Karl Lark \"et al.\" demonstrated co-segregation of DNA in the cells of plant root tips. Plant root tips labeled with tritiated thymidine tended to segregate their labeled DNA to the same daughter cell. Though not all the labeled DNA segregated to the same daughter, the amount of thymidine-labeled DNA seen in the daughter with less label corresponded to the amount that would have arisen from sister-chromatid exchange. Later studies by Christopher Potten \"et al.\" (2002), using pulse/chase experiments with tritiated thymidine, found long-term label-retaining cells in the small intestinal crypts of neonatal mice. These researchers hypothesized that long-term incorporation of tritiated thymidine occurred because neonatal mice have undeveloped small intestines, and that pulsing tritiated thymidine soon after the birth of the mice allowed the \\'immortal\\' DNA of adult stem cells to be labeled during their formation. These long-term cells were demonstrated to be actively cycling, as demonstrated by incorporation and release of BrdU.\\n\\nSince these cells were cycling but continued to contain the BrdU label in their DNA, the researchers reasoned that they must be segregating their DNA using an immortal DNA strand mechanism. Joshua Merok \"et al.\" from the lab of James Sherley engineered mammalian cells with an inducible p53 gene that controls asymmetric divisions. BrdU pulse/chase experiments with these cells demonstrated that chromosomes segregated non-randomly only when the cells were induced to divide asymmetrically like adult stem cells. These asymmetrically dividing cells provide an \"in vitro\" model for demonstration and investigation of immortal strand mechanisms. \\n\\nScientists have strived to demonstrate that this immortal DNA strand mechanism exists \"in vivo\" in other types of adult stem cells. In 1996 Nik Zeps published the first paper demonstrating label retaining cells were present in the mouse mammary gland and this was confirmed in 2005 by Gilbert Smith who also published evidence that a subset of mouse mammary epithelial cells could retain DNA label and release DNA label in a manner consistent with the immortal DNA strand mechanism. Soon after, scientists from the laboratory of Derek van der Kooy showed that mice have neural stem cells that are BrdU-retaining and continue to be mitotically active. Asymmetric segregation of DNA was shown using real-time imaging of cells in culture. In 2006, scientists in the lab of Shahragim Tajbakhsh presented evidence that muscle satellite cells, which are proposed to be adult stem cells of the skeletal muscle compartment, exhibited asymmetric segregation of BrdU-labelled DNA when put into culture. They also had evidence that demonstrated BrdU release kinetics consistent with an immortal DNA strand mechanism were operating \"in vivo\", using juvenile mice and mice with muscle regeneration induced by freezing.\\n\\nThese experiments supporting the immortal strand hypothesis, however, are not conclusive. While the Lark experiments demonstrated co-segregation, the co-segregation may have been an artifact of radiation from the tritium. Although Potten identified the cycling, label-retaining cells as adult stem cells, these cells are difficult to identify unequivocally as adult stem cells. While the engineered cells provide an elegant model for co-segregation of chromosomes, studies with these cells were done \"in vitro\" with engineered cells. Some features may not be present \"in vivo\" or may be absent \"in vitro\". In May 2007 evidence in support of the Immortal DNA Strand theory was discovered by Michael Conboy et al., using the muscle stem/satellite cell model during tissue regeneration, where there is tremendous cell division during a relatively brief period of time. Using two BrdU analogs to label template and newly synthesized DNA strands, they saw that about half of the dividing cells in regenerating muscle sort the older \"Immortal\" DNA to one daughter cell and the younger DNA to the other. In keeping with the stem cell hypothesis, the more undifferentiated daughter typically inherited the chromatids with the older DNA, while the more differentiated daughter inherited the younger DNA.\\n\\nExperimental evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis is sparse. In one study, researchers incorporated tritiated thymidine into dividing murine epidermal basal cells. They followed the release of tritiated thymidine after various chase periods, but the pattern of release was not consistent with the immortal strand hypothesis. Although they found label-retaining cells, they were not within the putative stem cell compartment. With increasing lengths of time for the chase periods, these label-retaining cells were located farther from the putative stem cell compartment, suggesting that the label-retaining cells had moved. However, finding conclusive evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis has proven difficult.\\n\\nSection::::Further models.\\nAfter Cairns first proposed the immortal DNA strand mechanism, the theory has undergone several refinements.\\n\\nIn 2002, he proposed that in addition to using immortal DNA strand mechanisms to segregate DNA, when the immortal DNA strands of adult stem cells undergo damage, they will choose to die (apoptose) rather than use DNA repair mechanisms that are normally used in non-stem cells. \\nEmmanuel David Tannenbaum and James Sherley developed a quantitative model describing how repair of point mutations might differ in adult stem cells. They found that in adult stem cells, repair was most efficient if they used an immortal DNA strand mechanism for segregating DNA, rather than a random segregation mechanism. This method would be beneficial because it avoids wrongly fixing DNA mutations in both DNA strands and propagating the mutation.\\n\\nSection::::Mechanisms.\\nThe complete proof of a concept generally requires a plausible mechanism that could mediate the effect. Although controversial, there is a suggestion that this could be provided by the Dynein Motor. This paper is accompanied by a comment summarizing the findings and background.\\n\\nHowever, this work has highly respected biologists among its detractors as exemplified by a further comment on a paper by the same authors from 2006.

Coleman\\'s outburst could have been due to members of Chute Boxe entering the ring. Despite this, Silva and other Chute Boxe members attacked Coleman in the ring, Baroni took Silva to the ground and Wanderlei had to be restrained with a foot placed on his head. Following the event, Coleman approached Chute Boxe to apologize, but the Chute Boxe fighters turned him away.\\n\\nSection::::PRIDE 32 The Real Deal.\\nTeam Hammer House was heavily represented at Pride FC\\'s first American show, PRIDE 32 in Las Vegas on October 21, 2006, being involved in three of the eight fights including the main event.

Rutherford also obtained a temporary restraining order against him the following month.\\n\\nGiersch\\'s U.S. visa was revoked in April 2012, after Rutherford\\'s lawyer informed the State Department about issues pertaining to Giersch\\'s businesses, which led the Department to conclude that they had sufficient evidence to deport him.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the allegations involved fraud or an involvement in drugs and weapons dealing in South America, considered terrorism under the Victory Act. Giersch consequently was unable to enter the United States and took up residence in France and Monaco. In May 2012, Rutherford and Giersch\\'s children went to France to spend the summer with their father. Rutherford asked the court to grant her sole custody so that she could keep the children primarily in the United States following their visit to France, as the existing joint custody agreement required her to travel frequently to enable Giersch to spend time with the children.\\n\\nIn August 2012, in a widely reported decision, a California Superior Court judge ruled that the 50/50 custody arrangement should remain and that, because Giersch is unable to travel to the United States, the children should live in France with him and attend school there, with Rutherford traveling there to visit them. Though Rutherford opposed the decision and requested a stay of proceedings while she appealed, her request was denied and it was ruled that, in two years, his eligibility to enter the United States and the consequent well-being of the children will be reassessed.\\n\\nIn June 2013, Rutherford filed for bankruptcy, stating she had debts of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the $1.5 million she spent on legal fees relating to the divorce and custody dispute with Giersch.\\n\\nIn May 2015, Rutherford was granted temporary sole custody of her children, following a ruling that both her son and daughter be brought back to the United States from Monaco, where they had been living with their father since 2012. On July 23, 2015, a California judge ruled that California did not have jurisdiction over Rutherford\\'s child custody case because she resides in New York, and her former husband was again awarded custody.\\n\\nRutherford then filed a case in New York but on July 27, 2015, the New York court ruled it also did not have jurisdiction.\\n\\nIn December 2015, the Monaco courts reconfirmed that full custody remained with the children\\'s father, with Rutherford granted extensive visitation rights in France and Monaco as well as shared input regarding \"health, schooling, religious education and any change of residence\".\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kelly Rutherford', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=719194'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'bQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7193238', 'text': 'Paul H.

Besides twelve books of artistic and scholarly prose, his essays and short stories have been published in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Partisan Review\", \"North American Review\", \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"Prism International\", and many other American and Canadian periodicals. His fiction has also appeared in Russian, Polish, and Israeli journals. A three-time recipient of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts fellowships in writing, he has also received numerous grants for writing both fiction and non-fiction from the City University of New York. Draitser has given numerous public lectures and book talks at universities and cultural centers in the United States, Canada, UK, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and Russia.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nDraitser grew up in a Jewish family in the Soviet Union in the post-World War II years, in the anti-Semitic atmosphere of late Stalinism, at a time when Jews were forced to be silent about their religion and often tried to change their Jewish names. It was an oppressive childhood filled with suspicion and mistrust. As a young student, Draitser excelled at literature and decided that he wanted to be a journalist, despite his mother\\'s preference that he study engineering. At that time, Jews attempting to enter the humanities encountered resistance, as Soviet system saw those areas as politically vulnerable and felt that Jews entering them would try to subvert the system. Despite this, Draitser earned degrees first in engineering, and later in journalism.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nDraitser has published both fiction and nonfiction since 1965. His work has appeared in leading Russian journals (including \"Youth, Literary Gazette\", and \"Crocodile\") under his pen name \\'Emil Abramov\\'. He began his writing career as a freelancer contributing satirical articles to Soviet newspapers and magazines, though he had to be careful about what he wrote. For example, while he could criticize a particular factory for the poor workmanship of goods it produced, he could not criticize the economic system as a whole, although it became increasingly clear to him that the lack of competition that would inspire innovation combined with the Soviet mandate to guarantee work for all employees, regardless of their work ethic, made it impossible to produce quality products. Eventually, Draitser wrote an article critical of an important official which led to him being blacklisted, and prompted him to leave for the United States. \\nIn 1975, he settled in Los Angeles, where he earned a Ph.D. in Russian literature from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1986, he accepted a position at Hunter College in New York City, where he continues to teach. His first book published in the United States, \"Forbidden Laughter\" (1980) brought him national attention. Feature articles on him and his book appeared in \"The New York Times<nowiki></nowiki>\", Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. He has appeared on \"NBC News with Tom Brokaw\", the \"Merv Griffin Show<nowiki></nowiki>\", and National Public Radio.\\n\\nDraitser\\'s research and writing have been supported by grants from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, the Social Science Foundation, and numerous grants from the City University of New York. A three-time recipient of fellowships from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, he has been awarded residencies at the Vermont Arts Studios, Byrdcliffe Woodstock Art Colony, Renaissance House, and Banff Center for the Arts (Canada).

The arena is owned and operated by the Fairbanks North Star Borough. Originally constructed as an airplane hangar for the Lend-Lease program in Tanacross, southeast of Fairbanks, the building was dismantled, transported to Fairbanks and reassembled in 1968. It has undergone two major renovations since then. The building is home to the Fairbanks Ice Dogs ice hockey team. The borough\\'s parks and recreation department is headquartered in the building.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nPrior to 1968, the building now known as the Big Dipper was an aircraft hangar located in Tanacross, Alaska. Constructed during World War II, the building saw little use after the war.\\n\\nIn 1968, Hez Ray, a teacher and coach at Lathrop High School, organized a crew of high school students and volunteers and undertook a project to move the derelict hangar to Fairbanks and repurpose it as an ice skating arena. Coach Rayâs initial group of boys were âFirst Boots on the Groundâ in the beginning of the enormous project. The incredible story of this adventure is in Coach Rayâs book âThe Big Dipper, A Dream is Bornâ. (Copyright Hez Ray, 2014) () The group purchased the hangar for a dollar and, using equipment donated by Fairbanks construction companies, dismantled the building and moved it to Fairbanks. The volunteers then reconstructed the building in its present location from the dismantled parts of the hangar. After rebuilding the hangar, the volunteers built an ice rink and bleachers inside, but due to a lack of resources the building itself was reconstructed essentially as it had been in Tanacross. Heated restrooms and locker rooms with showers were added in 1972-1973. The building itself remained unheated until its 1980s renovation, with large portable space heaters normally associated with airplane hangars used on occasion in the winter, in an attempt to provide some heat to the facility during events.\\n\\nThe Alaska Gold Kings, a hockey team which began in 1975 as a league team sponsored by the Teamsters Union Local 959, played at the Dipper for more than two decades before moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado. The World Eskimo Indian Olympics was held in the building for most of its existence. When the Dipper was unavailable due to renovations, WEIO decided to hold their 2007 event at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, the first time it was held outside of Fairbanks. As an enticement to remain in Fairbanks, WEIO was offered the Carlson Center in place of the Dipper for future events, where it has been held since.\\n', 'title': 'Big Dipper Ice Arena', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7200638'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7200799', 'text': 'Jonas SnÃ¤ckmark\\n\\nJonas \"SnÃ¤ckan\" SnÃ¤ckmark (born 27 January 1986 in Halmstad, Halland County, Sweden) is a Swedish metal-singer who stood out as one of the eleven finalists in Idol 2006 - the Swedish version of Idol.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Jonas SnÃ¤ckmark', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7200799'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7203963', 'text': \"Giants Challenge\\n\\nThe Giants Challenge is a one-day mountain-bike marathon held in April in the rugged and picturesque Giant's Castle area of the Drakensberg Mountains in South Africa.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Giants Challenge', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7203963'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'eAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7206755', 'text': 'Tom Nieporte\\n\\nThomas Nieporte (October 21, 1928 â December 21, 2014) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1950s and 1960s.\\n\\nNieporte grew up in the Cincinnati suburb of North College Hill, Ohio.

It is currently held by Labor Party MP Coralee O\\'Rourke.\\n\\nSection::::Overview.\\nThe seat is one of four within the Townsville urban area in North Queensland. Significant utilities within the Mundingburra electorate are the Townsville Hospital, the Douglas Campus of James Cook University and Stockland Shoppingcentre. Suburbs of the Electorate include; Heatley, Cranbrook, Aitkenvale, Mundingburra, Vincent, Douglas, Annandale, Gulliver, Mysterton, Rosslea, part of Kirwan and Pimlico north of the Ross River.\\n\\nMundingburra Electorate is bordered by the Burdekin (South), Townsville (North and East) and Thuringowa (West) Electorates.\\n\\nSection::::Electoral history.\\nThe first incarnation of the Mundingburra electorate was created at the 1911 redistribution, encompassing parts of the former electorates of Herbert and Bowen. It was a historically Labor seat, but from 1944 onwards was held by North Queensland Labor Party MP Tom Aikens. It changed significantly in a 1949 redistribution, and was abolished in 1959, with most of the district becoming part of the new Townsville South electorate.\\n\\nSection::::1996 by-election.\\nThe Mundingburra electoral district attracted national attention and headlines in early 1996 with a by-election called after the Court of Disputed Returns declared the result in the seat from July 1995 election void. The result had taken over a week to determine and ended up with the incumbent member, Ken Davies of the Labor Party, winning by 16 votes. This gave the Goss government a one-seat majority in Parliament - 45 seats to the Coalition\\'s 43 and one conservative-leaning independent, Liz Cunningham. Davies was subsequently appointed as Minister for Emergency Services and Consumer Affairs.\\n\\nThe Liberals challenged the result in August and on 8 December, the court ordered a new election, partly on the basis that administrative difficulties had deprived several military personnel serving in Rwanda of their vote. It was generally understood that the fate of the Goss government likely rested on the result, and Goss himself was prominent in it, announcing amongst other things a A$1 billion Korean zinc smelter for Townsville and asking voters to end the uncertainty \"bedevilling\" the Queensland political system. An expected federal election in March 1996 where the unpopular Keating Government (also Labor) would face the voters was a key feature in the background.\\n\\nThings became somewhat chaotic when Labor, on the basis of internal polling data and a legal case between Davies and the Commonwealth Bank, decided to drop Davies as its endorsed candidate, selecting Tony Mooney, the mayor of Townsville in his place. Davies reacted angrily, ultimately running as an independent and generating a considerable level of media publicity. A total of 12 candidates supporting a raft of causes ended up nominating by the draw of ballot papers on 12 January. On 25 January, Keating called the federal election for 2 March, which Goss described as an \"outside distraction\".\\n\\nContradictory polls generally suggested the Coalition would win, although a late poll by AGB McNair two days before polling day suggested Labor could still win. However, on the day, a swing of 2.83% to the Liberals saw their candidate Frank Tanti, a shop manager and committed Christian who had run a low-level doorknocking campaign for months, win the by-election. Within days, it became clear that Independent Liz Cunningham would support the Coalition, and the Goss government resigned, allowing Rob Borbidge to form a minority government which lasted until the 1998 election. At that election, Labor, under Peter Beattie, won back both Mundingburra and governing party status.\\n', 'title': 'Electoral district of Mundingburra', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7207251'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ewE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7207738', 'text': 'Innocent Ntsume\\n\\nInnocent Ntsume (born 7 July 1980) is a South African professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nNtsume began his professional career in 1999 with Jomo Cosmos, before moving to FC AK in August 2008.

Since then, there have been dozens of suicide attacks within and outside the republic of Chechnya, resulting in thousands of casualties among Russian security personnel and civilians. The profiles of the suicide bombers have varied, as have the circumstances surrounding the bombings.\\n\\nAlthough the most publicized Chechen suicide attacks have taken place in Moscow, most attacks have occurred in Chechnya, while several additional attacks have taken place in the extended North Caucasus region and particular the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. The majority of suicide bombings, targeting military installations and government compounds in and around Chechnya and also top government officials, have been directed against those whom the separatists consider to be combatants.\\n\\nSection::::Summary.\\nAs of 2009, most of the bombers appear to be ethnic Chechens, with a few known exceptions. Although some of the attacks may have also been carried out by Ingush, an ethnic group closely related to the Chechens (the Ingush bear a separate set of grudges against Russia, including Russian support of the Ossetian side of the East Prigorodny Conflict), none have occurred in the republics of Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria or with any known involvement of local rebel groups there.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of any foreign involvement in either the planning or execution of Chechen attacks aside from the inspiration from the tactics employed in the ArabâIsraeli conflict. In contrast to Palestinian suicide bombers, whose families are offered large cash rewards, no financial rewards are given. Female suicide bombers, referred to as \"\"shahidka\"\" by Chechens (meaning a female Islamic martyr) or \"Black Widows\" by Russians (as they have often had their husbands [and/or children] killed by the Russian army or the Kadyrovtsy), comprise a clear majority of Chechen suicide attackers; this trend stands in direct contrast to ongoing suicide bomb campaigns in Israel and Iraq, where women constitute only a small minority of suicide bombers.\\n\\nWhat is also somewhat unusual about Chechen bombing is that although the tactics used are largely similar to those used by Islamic militants, religion is usually not the cited motivation, despite Russian claims. For example, female bomber Khava Barayeva stated that she attacked in the name of Chechen independence, and urged more Chechens to do the same for their national honor.\\n\\nFamily members of identified bombers often suffer severe reprisals (beatings, arson attacks, kidnappings, torture and murder) at the hands of masked gunmen presumed to be government agents and members of pro-Kremlin militias, although the same may be said about the relatives of all Chechen rebels.\\n\\nThrough the first five years of the Chechen-Russian conflict (including the First Chechen War and most of the first year of the Second Chechen War), there were no planned suicide bombings related to Chechnya. The highest concentrations of suicide attacks to date occurred in the following time periods:\\n\\nRadical rebel commander Shamil Basayev and his extremist gang, Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs, claimed responsibility for many of them.\\n\\nIn late 2004, following the Beslan disaster, attacks (excluding those against the Kadyrov regime) ceased for four years due to major changes in tactics employed by the separatist movement. The reason for this was cited as a certain amount of shame over Beslan on the part of the Chechen separatists. A spokesman said in 2004 that \"A bigger blow could not have been dealt on us. ... People around the world will think that Chechens are beasts and monsters if they could attack children.\"\\n\\nThe bombings resumed by 2008 and in April 2009. Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov announced the reactivation of the Riyadus-Salikhin extremist gang, which had been disbanded in 2006 at the behest of Umarov\\'s predecessor Sheikh Abdul Halim. Numerous attacks were then conducted during what Umarov called the \"year of offensive\".

From June 2001 to November 2002 he was the republic's Prime Minister and for a time Jergenia looked to be the favourite to succeed Abkhazia's first president Vladislav Ardzinba.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nJergenia was born on 8 August 1941 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He graduated from the Moscow State University with a diploma in Law in 1963. During Soviet times, he held several offices within the administration of the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: investigator at the Interior Ministry, chief investigator of the Prosecutorâs Office of Sukhumi, Public Court Chairman of Sukhumi and member of the Supreme Court of the\\nAbkhazian ASSR.\\n\\nAfter the break-up of the Soviet Union, from 1992 to 2001, Jergenia served as the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Abkhazia, as which, amongst other things, he had to defend Abkhazia's treatment of its prisoners of war. On 14 April 1999 Jergenia was re-appointed by the People's Assembly to a second term as Prosecutor General only after several rounds of voting.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2002 Jergenia was the chief negotiator and designated representative at the Georgian-Abkhazian peace for President Vladislav Ardzinba. In this capacity, he personally handled most of the negotiations with Russia, Georgia, the United States and the United Nations.\\n\\nSection::::Prime minister.\\nJergenia was appointed to the post of Prime Minister June 7, 2001. Due to President Ardzinba's deteriorating health, Jergenia could lead Abkhazia politically, unlike previous Prime Ministers, who had mainly concerned themselves with economic policy. Perhaps even more so than other Abkhazian politicians, he was pro-Russian, and vociferously opposed to reunification with Georgia. Jergenia openly discussed working towards associate membership of Russia and encouraged Abkhazians to take up Russian passports, which a large percentage of the population eventually did. He also pledged a military alliance with Eduard Kokoity, President of South Ossetia to discourage Georgia from attacking either entity.\\n\\nOn 29 November 2002, Jergenia was fired by President Ardzinba, officially due to his failure to ensure fulfillment of budget targets and to prepare adequately for winter. However, for the first nine months of that year budget had been implemented fully and Jergenia's dismissal was widely seen as politically motivated. At the moment of his sacking, he had just returned from Moscow where he had signed a contract on supplying electricity to Krasnodar krai from Abkhazia, and he was widely seen at the time as the main candidate for succeeding Ardzinba as president. The President's wife, Svetlana Ardzinba, was Jergenia's first cousin, and Jergenia was thought to have been building up support in Moscow. Some think that Ardzinba found that Jergenia was too openly ambitious about the presidency, that he put Russian interests above Abkhazian interest, or that he dropped support for Jergenia due to his unpopularity with the Abkhazian population.\\n\\nJergenia was replaced by former Prime Minister Gennady Gagulia. This led to a shift in Abkhazian foreign policy, as Jergenia, while still steadfast on the question of independence, was much more open to negotiations than his successor.\\n\\nJergenia had been a close friend and collaborator of Ardzinba since the 1970s, but the two fell out when Ardzinba dismissed Jergenia as Prime Minister. They reconciled after Ardzinba retired as President in 2005.\\n\\nSection::::2004 Presidential elections.\\nAlready during the 2002 Parliamentary elections, while still Prime Minister, Jergenia had supported the parliamentary candidates of public movement Amtsakhara. In 2003, he spoke at Amtsakhara's congress, where he argued in favour of reducing Presidential powers and moving towards a mixed presidential/parliamentary model of government. Jergenia then became Amtsakhara's favoured candidate for the October 2004 presidential elections before it entered into an alliance with United Abkhazia and chose to back Sergei Bagapsh instead. A minority faction of Amtsakhara continued its support for Jergenia, and he did enter into the elections, with Ruslan Kishmaria as his Vice-Presidential candidate, head of the Gali district assembly. The pair came in only fourth place in the first round, receiving 2277 votes, and did not contest the second.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Anri Jergenia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=722036'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'iAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7221128', 'text': 'Fabio Bidini\\n\\nFabio Bidini (born in Arezzo on 11 June 1968) is an Italian pianist.

She traveled west in the early 1880s to teach school in Ojai, California; her letters about the trip were later published in the California Historical Quarterly (1937â1938). She was a Protestant Christian missionary in Northern China and belonged to the so-called \"missionary generation\" of Americans born between the years 1860 - 1885.\\n\\nSection::::Early years and children.\\nTo honor the example of a beloved cousin who had died in mission work in China, Anna Seward decided to travel there as a Presbyterian missionary and settled in Huang Xian, Shandong province in North China, where she met Cicero Washington Pruitt. They married on February 16, 1888, and had five children: Ida (1888â1985), John (1890â1912), Ashley (1892â1898), Virginia (died in infancy, 1894), Robert (1897â1961), and Dudley McConnell \"Mac\" (1902â1967). The death of Ashley and Virginia inspired Southern Baptists to send money to start a hospital in Huang Xian. The famous missionary Lottie Moon apparently babysat the children on some occasions. Ida was one of the few Westerners that remained influential in Chinese Aid and Development throughout much of the century even after the communist take over. While stationed in Huangxian, the children attended school at the Chefoo School operated by the China Inland Mission. Anna Seward began a missionary school for boys, and by 1904 C.W. Pruitt had organized the Baptist Theological Seminary for Central China.\\n\\nSection::::Writings and later years.\\nAnna wrote two books about missionary life in China: The Day of Small Things (Foreign Mission Board, Southern Baptist Convention, 1929) and Up from Zero: In North China (Broadman Press, 1939). She also wrote two children\\'s books set in China: The Chinese Boat Baby (Rice Press, 1938) and Whirligigs in China: Stories for Juniors (Broadman, 1948). After C.W. retired in 1936, they returned to the United States and settled in Atlanta where he became the dean of the Baptist Foreign Missions of North America.

Hesselblad is also recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations due to her efforts in World War II saving the lives of Jewish people during the genocide of the Holocaust.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nSection::::Early life and conversion.\\nMaria Elizabeth Hesselblad born on 4 June 1870 as the fifth of thirteen children born to August Robert Hesselblad and Cajsa Petersdotter Dag â Lutheran parents from FÃ¥glavik in VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland County; she had a brother: Thur. She was baptized the following month and received into the Lutheran Church of Sweden in her parish of Hudene.\\n\\nBy 1886, she had to work to help them make ends meet. At first she looked for work in Sweden, but eventually emigrated to the United States of America in 1888, where she studied nursing at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. While there, she did home nursing, which brought her into contact with the Catholic faith of many of the poor for whom she cared. She developed an interest in that faith while deep prayer and personal study led her down the path of conversion, and on 15 August 1902 â the Feast of the Assumption â she received conditional baptism from a Jesuit priest, Johann Georg Hagen, in the chapel of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in Washington, D.C. Hagen also became her spiritual director. As she reflected on that moment, she wrote: \"In an instant the love of God was poured over me. I understood that I could respond to that love only through sacrifice and a love prepared to suffer for His glory and for the Church. Without hesitation I offered Him my life, and my will to follow Him on the Way of the Cross\". Two days later, she received her First Communion and would depart for Europe.\\n\\nHesselblad approached Hagen and asked that she be received into the Church at once to which Hagen said: \"My dear daughter, how could I do that? I have just met you\". She said: \"My father, forgive me, but I have fought in darkness for twenty years; for many years I have studied the Catholic faith and have prayed for a strong faith ... I now possess this faith, and I am ready to submit to an examination on all the points of doctrine\". Hagen questioned this, and after great consideration told her: \"I see no reason not to receive you unto the Church. Today is August 12, and the 15th will be the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. That day, I will receive you into the Catholic Church; the following Sunday, the 17th, you will be able to receive Holy Communion. Spend these few days in retreat and come to see me twice a day for lessons\". It was in that same year that her brother, Thur, converted to Catholicism.\\n\\nSection::::As a religious.\\nHesselblad then made a pilgrimage to Rome, where she received the sacrament of Confirmation. She also visited the House of Saint Bridget of Sweden there, where the medieval saint had spent the last half of her life, which made a deep impression upon her. At that point she felt called to dedicate her life to the work of Christian unity. She returned to New York City briefly, only to go back to Rome, where, on 25 March 1904, she was welcomed as a guest by the nuns of the Carmelite monastery housed there; Mother Hedwig â the prioress â welcomed her after hesitating to accept her due to her weak health. However, she allowed her on the condition of a period of probation. Yet it was at this point she fell gravely ill and even had to receive the Extreme Unction. She slowly recovered and held out against her family\\'s pleas to return to Sweden.\\n\\nShe petitioned the Holy See to be able to make religious vows under the Rule of the Order which Brigid had founded, and had been a prominent presence in the Church in Sweden before the Protestant Reformation had taken hold there. She received special permission for this from Pope Pius X in 1906, at which time she assumed the Bridgettine religious habit, including its distinctive element of a silver crown. She professed into the hands of Hagen on 22 June 1906, the Feast of the Sacred Heart.\\n\\nHesselblad attempted to revive interest in the order and its founder in both Sweden and Rome. Her proposal to establish a monastery of the order on the site where Bridget had lived received no volunteers from the few monasteries of the order still in existence. Giving up on the intention of following the established way of life in the order, she proposed one which included the care of the sick. To this end she was joined by three young women from England, whom she received on 9 November 1911, with which the new congregation was established. Their particular mission was to pray and work, especially for the conversion of the Scandinavian people to the Catholic Church.\\n\\nHesselblad returned to her homeland of Sweden in 1923, where she was able to establish a community in Djursholm, while she worked nursing the sick poor. The new congregation was established in England in 1931 after receiving the approval of the Holy See. That same year, Hesselblad obtained the House of Saint Bridget in Rome for her new congregation. A foundation was made in India in 1937 which drew many new members. Her order received canonical approval on 7 July 1940.\\n\\nHesselblad became known as \"the second Bridget\". During World War II â and after â she performed many charitable works on the behalf of the poor and those that suffered due to racial laws and also promoted a movement for peace that involved Christians and non-Christians, and she became part of their journey to faith and to the Church. The war also saw her save the lives of Jewish people who would have otherwise have perished in the Holocaust had it not been for her direct intervention.\\n\\nHer apostolic zeal contributed to the conversion of the Baptist Minister Piero Chuminelli â author of a biographical account of Saint Bridget of Sweden â and she also had close ties to the former Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel Zolli (Eugenio) who converted to the faith in 1946.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nHer health declined around the time when officials prepared the canonical visit of her order. On 23 April 1957 she gave her blessing to the sisters and held her raised hands in a solemn gesture in which she murmured: \"Go to Heaven with hands full of love and virtues\". She received the sacraments thereafter.\\n\\nHesselblad died in Rome on 24 April 1957 in the first hours of the morning â it was Easter Wednesday.\\n\\nSection::::Sainthood.\\nSection::::Process and beatification.\\nThe sainthood process commenced in Rome in 1987 and concluded its work in 1990. During this period the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause and her being granted the title of Servant of God on 4 February 1988 â the first official stage in the process. The diocesan process was ratified on 21 June 1991 which allowed for the submission of the Positio to Rome for further investigation. Theologians granted the cause their approval on 10 November 1998 while the C.C.S. approved it also on 16 March 1999.\\n\\nPope John Paul II proclaimed her to be Venerable on 26 March 1999 after he recognized that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle requested for her beatification was investigated in 1996 and received ratification in Rome on 17 October 1998. The pope approved it at the beginning of 2000 allowing for her beatification on the following 9 April 2000.\\n\\nSection::::Canonization.\\nPope Francis approved the second miracle attributed to her on 14 December 2015 which would allow for her future canonization; the date was decided at an ordinary consistory of cardinals on 15 March 2016 and was celebrated in Saint Peter\\'s Square on 5 June 2016.\\n\\nThe miracle was investigated in the diocese of its origin in Cuba in February 2014 â the miracle in question occurred in the late 2000s â and was validated in Rome on 20 June 2014.

Liz Hamilton, a young woman with literary ambitions, and Merry Noel Blake, an all-American blonde beauty from Atlanta, are close friends who met while they were freshmen at Smith College in the 1950s.\\n\\nSoon after graduation, Liz writes a critically acclaimed book and drifts into unfulfilling relationships and one-night stands, including an empty encounter in an airplane lavatory, a fling with a teenaged hustler and an affair with Chris Adams, a young reporter for \"Rolling Stone\". Meanwhile, Merry fulfills her aspiration to a life of domesticity caring for a husband and child by marrying Doug Blake and moving to a beach house in Malibu.\\n\\nAlthough Merry is happy, she can\\'t help but envy Liz for her glamorous career as an author. Merry decides to write a book of her own and, with Liz\\'s assistance, \"A House by the Sea\", a trashy roman Ã  clef about the Malibu colony, finds a publisher and becomes a huge best-seller. Before long Merry is a darling of the media and her fame and fortune surpass those of Liz (who is experiencing a severe case of writer\\'s block), leading to jealousy between the old friends and problems in Merry\\'s marriage.\\n\\nThe film takes place over the course of 22 years, first depicting Merry\\'s and Doug\\'s elopement in 1959, and then picking up during three segments, taking place in 1969, 1975 and 1981, showing changes in the characters\\' relationships (and society) over the course of two decades.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nRobert Mulligan originally was slated to direct, but when members of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Screen Actors Guild went on strike four days after filming began, the production shut down. Mulligan was forced to withdraw when previous commitments conflicted with the new schedule. The film proved to be the last directed by George Cukor. It also marked the screen debuts of an 8-year-old Nicole Eggert and also Meg Ryan, who played Merry\\'s daughter in the 1969 and 1981 segments, respectively.\\n\\nNew York City locations seen in the film include the Algonquin Hotel and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Additional locations include Madison, New Jersey (standing in for Northampton, Massachusetts), Los Angeles, and Malibu. Interiors were filmed at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City. Sets were later rented for use in the Biltmore Hotel scenes in the 1984 blockbuster Ghostbusters.\\n\\nNina Foch, Dick Cavett, Ray Bradbury, Merv Griffin, Marsha Hunt, Christopher Isherwood, Gavin Lambert, Roger Vadim, and Paul Morrissey make appearances in the film.\\n\\nThe soundtrack includes \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" performed by Bessie Smith and \"On The Sunny Side of the Street\" sung by Willie Nelson.\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nCritics were mixed about the film.\\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"The movie can\\'t make up its mind whether it\\'s about a tumultuously difficult but rewarding friendship or whether it\\'s a sendup of the contemporary literary scene. It fails as both...The culprit is Gerald Ayres...[who] has spread his talents very thin...Though he has written two big roles, he doesn\\'t seem capable of writing either a romantic drama, like \"The Turning Point\", or an informed satire...Mr. Ayres can occasionally write good wisecracks...But he has no particular insight into the publishing scene. Nor does he ever convince us of the enduring strength of the friendship that lasts through thick and, more often, thin. Though Misses Bisset and Bergen are appealing actresses, \"Rich and Famous\" doesn\\'t hold together.\"\\n\\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" observed \"This film is a real curiosity. It\\'s a good-bad movie, like \"The Other Side of Midnight\" or \"The Greek Tycoon\". It contains scenes that make you want to squirm because of their awkwardness and awfulness, and yet you don\\'t want to look away and you\\'re not bored. The movie has the courage to go to extremes, and some of those extremes may not be art but are certainly unforgettable...It\\'s a slick, trashy, entertaining melodrama, with too many dumb scenes to qualify as successful.\"\\n\\n\"Variety\" wrote \"While not without its problems, \"Rich and Famous\" is an absorbing drama of some notable qualities, the greatest of which is a gutsy, fascinating and largely magnificent performance by Jacqueline Bisset...For a bright, sophisticated piece such as this, particularly one under the guidance of the irrepressibly elegant George Cukor, the somewhat harsh, murky visual style is surprising.\"\\n\\n\"TV Guide\" rated the film one out of four stars and commented, \"This could have been â and is â a very funny film; unfortunately, most of the laughs are unintentional...Although his version of Van Druten\\'s play \"Old Acquaintance\" is sexier than the original 1943 screen treatment...it also fails to satisfy on many levels...This glossy soap opera suffers from Cukor\\'s failure to control his actors. Moreover, the costumes are atrocious. The film simply lacks the sophisticated style that made Cukor famous.\"\\n\\nPauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" stated \"\"Rich and Famous\" isn\\'t camp, exactly: It\\'s more like a homosexual fantasy. Jacqueline Bisset\\'s affairs, with their masochistic overtones, are creepy, because they don\\'t seem like what a woman would get into. And Candice Bergen is used almost as if she were a big, goosey, female impersonator.\"\\n\\n\"Time Out London\" wrote \"Considering neither Bisset nor Bergen had ever shown the slightest acting ability before in movies, their performances in the Bette Davis/Miriam Hopkins roles in this loose reworking of \"Old Acquaintance\" are very capable...Of course much of the credit must go to Cukor, the veteran \\'woman\\'s director\\'; but the film disappoints in its unconfident handling of the secondary characters.\"\\n\\nSection::::Awards and nominations.\\nGerald Ayres won the Writers Guild Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Rich and Famous (1981 film)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7238599'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'kwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7241443', 'text': 'The Floor Above\\n\\nThe Floor Above is a 1914 American silent mystery film directed by James Kirkwood.

He is one of the most popular and well-known Russian poets of the 20th century.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nSection::::Early life.\\nSergei Yesenin was born in Konstantinovo in Ryazan Governorate of the Russian Empire to a peasant family. His father was Alexander Nikitich Yesenin (1873â1931), his mother Tatyana Fyodorovna (nee Titova, 1875â1955).\\n\\nBoth his parents spent most of their time looking for work, father in Moscow, mother in Ryazan, so at age two Sergei was moved to the nearby village Matovo, to join Fyodor Alexeyevich and Natalya Yevtikhiyevna Titovs, his relatively well-off maternal grandparents, who essentially raised him.\\n\\nThe Titovs had three grown-up sons, and it was they who were Yesenin\\'s early years\\' companions. \"My uncles taught me horse-riding and swimming, one of them... even employed me as hound-dog, when going out to the ponds hunting ducks,\" he later remembered. He started to read aged five, and at nine began to write poetry, inspired originally by chastushkas and folklore, provided mostly by the grandmother whom he also remembered as a highly religious woman who used to take him to every single monastery sheâd choose to visit. He had two younger sisters, Yekaterina (1905â1977), and Alexandra (1911â1981).\\n\\nIn 1904 Yesenin joined the Konstantinovo zemstvo school. In 1909 he graduated it with an honorary certificate, and went on to study in the local secondary parochial school in Spas-Klepiki. From 1910 onwards, he started to write poetry systematically; eight poems dated that year were later included in his 1925 Collected Works. In all, Yesenin wrote around thirty poems during his school years. He compiled them into what was supposed to be his first book which he titled \"Bolnye Dumy\" (Sick Thoughts) and tried to publish it in 1912 in Ryazan, but failed.\\n\\nIn 1912, with a teacherâs diploma, Yesenin moved to Moscow, where he supported himself working as a proofreader\\'s assistant at the Sytin\\'s printing company. The following year he enrolled in Chanyavsky University to study history and philology as an external student, but had to leave it after eighteen months due to lack of funds. In the University he became friends with several aspiring poets, among them Dmitry Semyonovsky, Vasily Nasedkin, Nikolai Kolokolov and Ivan Filipchenko. Yeseninâs first marriage (which lasted three years) was in 1913 to Anna Izryadnova, a co-worker from the publishing house, with whom he had a son, Yuri. 1913 saw Yesenin becoming increasingly interested in Christianity, biblical motives became frequent in his poems. \"Grisha, what I am reading at the moment is the Gospel and find a lot of things which for me are new,\" he wrote to his close childhood friend G. Panfilov. That was also the year when he became involved with the Moscow revolutionary circles: for several months his flat was under secret police surveillance and in September 1913 it was raided and searched.\\n\\nSection::::Life and career.\\nIn January 1914 Yesenin\\'s first published poem \"Beryoza\" (The Birch Tree) appeared in the children\\'s magazine \"Mirok\" (Small World). More appearances followed in minor magazines such as \"Protalinka\" and \"Mlechny Put\". In December 1914 Yesenin quit work \"and gave himself to poetry, writing continually,\" according to his wife. Around this time he became a member of the Surikov Literary and Music circle.\\n\\nIn 1915, exasperated with the lack of interest in his work in Moscow, Yesenin moved to Petrograd. He arrived at the city on 8 March and the next day met Alexander Blok at his home, to read him poetry. He received a warm welcome and soon became acquainted with fellow-poets Sergey Gorodetsky, Nikolai Klyuev and Andrei Bely and well known in literary circles. Blok was especially helpful in promoting Yesenin\\'s early literary career, describing him as \"a gem of a peasant poet\" and his verse as \"fresh, pure and resounding\", even if \"wordy\". The same year he joined the Krasa (Beauty) group of peasant poets which included Klyuyev, Gorodetsky, Sergey Klychkov and Alexander Shiryayevets, among others. In his 1925 autobiography Yesenin said that Bely gave him the meaning of form while Blok and Klyuev taught him lyricism. It was Klyuyev who introduced Yesenin to the publisher Averyanov, who in early 1916 released his debut poetry collection \"Radunitsa\" which featured many of his early spiritual-themed verse. \"I would have eagerly relinquished some of my religious poems, large and small, but they make sense as an illustration of poets\\' progress towards the revolution,\" he would later write. Yesenin and Klyuyev maintained close and intimate friendship which lasted several years.\\n\\nIn 1915 Yesenin became a co-founder of the Krasa literary group and published numerous poems in the Petrograd magazines \"Russkaya Mysl\", \"Ezhemesyachny Zhurnal\", \"Novy Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh\", \"Golos Zhizni\" and \"Niva\". Among the authors he met later in the year were Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Nikolai Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova; he also visited painter Ilya Repin in his Penaty. Yesenin\\'s rise to fame was meteoric; by the end of the year he became the star of St Petersburg\\'s literary circles and salons. \"The city took to him with the delight a gourmet reserves for strawberries in winter. A barrage of praise hit him, excessive and often insincere,\" Maxim Gorky wrote to Romain Rolland.\\nOn 25 March 1916, Yesenin was drafted for military duty and in April joined a medical train based in Tsarskoye Selo, under the command of colonel D.N. Loman. In 22 July 1916, at a special concert attended by the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (the train\\'s patron) and her daughters, Yesenin recited his poems \"Rus\" and \"In Scarlet Fireglow\". \"The Empress told me my poems were beautiful, but sad. I replied, the same could be said about Russia as a whole,\" he recalled later. His relationships with Loman soon deteriorated. In October, Yesenin declined the colonel\\'s offer to write (with Klyuyev) and have published a book of pro-monarchist verses, and spent twenty days under arrest as a consequence.\\n\\nIn March 1917, Yesenin was sent to the Warrant Officers School but soon deserted the Kerensky\\'s army. In August 1917 (having divorced Izryadnova a year earlier) Yesenin married for a second time, to Zinaida Raikh (later an actress and the wife of Vsevolod Meyerhold). They had two children, a daughter Tatyana and a son Konstantin. The parents subsequently quarreled and lived separately for some time prior to their divorce in 1921. Tatyana became a writer and journalist and Konstantin Yesenin would become a well-known soccer statistician.\\n\\nYesenin supported the February Revolution. \"If not for [it], I might have withered away on useless religious symbolism,\" he wrote later. He greeted the rise of the Bolsheviks too. \"In the Revolution I was all on the side of the October, even if perceiving everything in my own peculiar way, from a peasant\\'s standpoint,\" he remembered in his 1925 autobiography. Later he criticized the Bolshevik rule, in such poems as \"The Stern October Has Deceived Me\". \"I feel very sad now, for we are going through such a period in [our] history when human individuality is being destroyed, and the approaching socialism is totally different from the one I was dreaming of,\" he wrote in an August 1920 letter to his friend Yevgeniya Livshits. \"I never joined the RKP, being further to the left than them,\" he maintained in his 1922 autobiography.\\nArtistically, the revolutionary years were exciting time for Yesenin. Among the important poems he wrote in 1917-1918 were \"Prishestviye\" (The Advent), \"Peobrazheniye\" (Transformation, which gave the title to the 1918 collection), and \"Inoniya\". In February 1918, after the Sovnarkom issued the \"Socialist Homeland is in Danger!\" decree-appeal, he joined the esers\\' military unit. He actively participated in the magazine \"Nash Put\" (Our Way), as well as the almanacs Skify (Ð¡ÐºÐ¸ÑÑ) and Krasny Zvon (in February his large poem \"Marfa Posadnitsa\" appeared in one of the latter). In September 1918 Yesenin co-founded (with Andrey Bely, Pyotr Oreshin, Lev Povitsky and Sergey Klychkov) the publishing house Ð¢ÑÑÐ´Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ñ ÐÑÑÐµÐ»Ñ Ð¥ÑÐ´Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð² Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð° (the Labor Artel of the Artists of the Word) which reissued (in six books) all that he\\'d written by this time.\\n\\nIn September 1918, Yesenin became friends with Anatoly Marienhof, with whom he founded the Russian literary movement of imaginism. Describing their group\\'s general appeal, he wrote in 1922: \"Prostitutes and bandits are our fans. With them, we are pals. Bolsheviks do not like us due to some kind of misunderstanding.\" In January 1919, Yesenin signed the Imaginists\\' Manifest. In February he, Marienhof and Vadim Shershenevich, founded the Imaginists publishing house. Before that, Yesenin became a member of the Moscow Union of Professional Writers and several months later was elected a member of the All-Russian Union of Poets. Two of his books, \"Kobyliyu Korabli\" (Mare\\'s Ships) and \"Klyuchi Marii\" (The Keys of Mary) came out later that year.\\nIn JulyâAugust 1920, Yesenin toured the Russian South, starting in Rostov-on-Don and ending in Tiflis, Georgia. In November 1920, he met Galina Benislavskaya, his future secretary and close friend. That year, he experienced his first serious trouble with the authorities. Following an anonymous report, he and two of his Imaginist friends, brothers Alexander and Ruben Kusikovs, were arrested by the Cheka in October but released a week later on the solicitation of his friend Yakov Blumkin. In the course of that year, the publication of three of Yesenin\\'s books were refused by publishing house Goslitizdat. His \"Triptych\" collection came out through the Skify Publishers in Berlin. Next year saw the collections \"Confessions of a Hooligan\" (January) and \"Treryaditsa\" (February) published. The drama in verse \"Pygachov\" came out in December 1921, to much acclaim.\\n\\nIn May 1921 he visited a friend, the poet Alexander Shiryaevets, in Tashkent, giving poetry readings and making a short trip to Samarkand. In the fall of 1921, while visiting the studio of painter Georgi Yakulov, Yesenin met the Paris-based American dancer Isadora Duncan, a woman 18 years his senior. She knew only a dozen words in Russian, and he spoke no foreign languages. Nevertheless, they married on 2 May 1922. Yesenin accompanied his celebrity wife on a tour of Europe and the United States. His marriage to Duncan was brief and in May 1923, he returned to Moscow. In his 1922 autobiography, Yesenin wrote: \"Russia\\'s recent nomadic past does not appeal to me, and I am all for civilization. But I dislike America intensely. America is a stinking place where not just art is being murdered, but with it, all the loftiest aspirations of humankind. If it\\'s America that we are looking up to, as [a model for our] future, then I\\'d rather stay under our greyish skies... We do not have those skyscrapers that\\'s managed to produce up to date nothing but Rockefeller and McCormick, but here Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Pushkin and Lermontov were born.\"\\n\\nIn 1923 Yesenin became romantically involved with the actress Augusta Miklashevskaya to whom he dedicated several poems, among them those of the \"Hooligan\\'s Love\" cycle. In the same year, he had a son by the poet Nadezhda Volpina. Alexander Esenin-Volpin grew up to become a poet and a prominent activist in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1960s. Since 1972, till his death in 2016, he lived in the United States as a famous mathematician and teacher.\\n\\nAs Yesenin\\'s popularity grew, stories began to circulate about his heavy drinking and consequent public outbursts. In autumn 1923, he was arrested in Moscow twice and underwent a series of enquiries from the OGPU secret police. Fellow poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, wrote that, after his return from America, Yesenin became more visible in newspaper police log sections than in poetry.\\n\\nMore serious were the accusations of anti-Semitism against Yesenin and three of his close friends, fellow poets, Sergey Klytchkov, Alexei Ganin and Pyotr Oreshin, made by Lev Sosnovsky, a prominent journalist and close Trotsky associate. The foursome retorted with an open letter in \"Pravda\" and, in December, were cleared by the Writers\\' Union burlaw court. It was later suggested, though, that Yesenin\\'s departure to the Caucasus in the summer of 1924 might have been a direct result of the harassment by the NKVD. Earlier that year, fourteen writers and poets, including his friend Ganin, were arrested as the alleged members of the (apparently fictitious) Order of the Russian Fascists, then tortured and executed in March without trial.\\n\\nIn JanuaryâApril 1924, Yesenin was arrested and interrogated four times. In February, he entered the Sheremetev hospital, then was moved into the Kremlin clinic in March. Nevertheless, he continued to make public recitals and released several books in the course of the year, including \"Moskva Kabatskaya\". In August 1924 Yesenin and fellow poet Ivan Gruzinov published a letter in \"Pravda\", announcing the end of the Imaginists.\\n\\nIn early 1925 Yesenin met and married Sophia Andreyevna Tolstaya (1900-1957), a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy. In May what proved to be his final large poem \"Anna Snegina\" came out. During the year, he compiled and edited The Works by Yesenin in three volumes which was published by Gosizdat posthumously.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nOn 28 December 1925, Yesenin was found dead in the room in the Hotel Angleterre in St Petersburg. His last poem \"Goodbye my friend, goodbye\" (ÐÐ¾ ÑÐ²Ð¸Ð´Ð°Ð½ÑÑ, Ð´ÑÑÐ³ Ð¼Ð¾Ð¹, Ð´Ð¾ ÑÐ²Ð¸Ð´Ð°Ð½ÑÑ) according to Wolf Ehrlich was written by him the day before he died. Yesenin complained that there was no ink in the room, and he was forced to write with his blood.\\n\\nAccording to his biographers, the poet was in a state of depression and committed suicide by hanging.\\n\\nAfter the funeral in the Union in Leningrad, poet Yesenin\\'s body was transported by train to Moscow, where a farewell for relatives and friends of the deceased was also arranged. He was buried December 31, 1925, in Moscow\\'s Vagankovskoye Cemetery. His grave is marked by a white marble sculpture.\\n\\nA theory exists that Yesenin\\'s death was actually a murder by OGPU agents who staged it to look like suicide. The novel \"Yesenin\" published by Vitali Bezrukov is devoted to this version of Yesenin\\'s death. In 2005 TV serial \"Sergey Yesenin\" based on this novel (with Sergey Bezrukov playing Yesenin) was shown on Channel One Russia. Facts tending to support the assassination hypothesis were cited by Stanislav Kunyaev and Sergey Kunyaev in the final chapter of their biography of Yesenin.\\n\\nEnraged by his death, Mayakovsky composed a poem called \"To Sergei Yesenin\", where the resigned ending of Yesenin\\'s death poem is countered by these verses: \"in this life it is not hard to die, / to mold life is more difficult.\" In a later lecture on Yesenin, he said that the revolution demanded \"that we glorify life.\" However, Mayakovsky himself would commit suicide in 1930.\\n\\nSection::::Cultural impact.\\nYesenin\\'s suicide triggered an epidemic of copycat suicides by his mostly female fans. For example, Galina Benislavskaya, his ex-girlfriend, killed herself by his graveside in December 1926. Although he was one of Russia\\'s most popular poets and had been given an elaborate state funeral, some of his writings were banned by the Kremlin during the reigns of Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. Nikolai Bukharin\\'s criticism of Yesenin contributed significantly to the banning. Only in 1966 were most of his works republished. Today Yesenin\\'s poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.\\n\\nBernd Alois Zimmermann included his poetry in his \"Requiem fÃ¼r einen jungen Dichter\" (\"Requiem for a Young Poet\"), completed in 1969.\\n\\nThe Ryazan State University is named in his honor.\\n\\nSection::::In popular culture.\\nYesenin appears as a character in the 1981 ballet \"Isadora\", by Kenneth Macmillan.\\n\\nA monument to Yesenin opened in St. Petersburg in 1995.\\n\\nIn 2005 Russian studio Pro-Cinema Production produced a TV mini-series \"Yesenin\".

It is built on the earlier BorelâWeil theorem of Armand Borel and AndrÃ© Weil, dealing just with the space of sections (the zeroth cohomology group), the extension to higher cohomology groups being provided by Raoul Bott. One can equivalently, through Serre\\'s GAGA, view this as a result in complex algebraic geometry in the Zariski topology.\\n\\nSection::::Formulation.\\nLet be a semisimple Lie group or algebraic group over formula_1, and fix a maximal torus along with a Borel subgroup which contains . Let be an integral weight of ; defines in a natural way a one-dimensional representation of , by pulling back the representation on , where is the unipotent radical of . Since we can think of the projection map as a principal -bundle, for each we get an associated fiber bundle on (note the sign), which is obviously a line bundle. Identifying with its sheaf of holomorphic sections, we consider the sheaf cohomology groups formula_2. Since acts on the total space of the bundle formula_3 by bundle automorphisms, this action naturally gives a -module structure on these groups; and the BorelâWeilâBott theorem gives an explicit description of these groups as -modules.\\n\\nWe first need to describe the Weyl group action centered at formula_4. For any integral weight and in the Weyl group , we set formula_5, where denotes the half-sum of positive roots of . It is straightforward to check that this defines a group action, although this action is \"not\" linear, unlike the usual Weyl group action. Also, a weight is said to be \"dominant\" if formula_6 for all simple roots . Let denote the length function on .\\n\\nGiven an integral weight , one of two cases occur:\\nThe theorem states that in the first case, we have\\n\\nand in the second case, we have\\n\\nIt is worth noting that case (1) above occurs if and only if formula_18 for some positive root . Also, we obtain the classical BorelâWeil theorem as a special case of this theorem by taking to be dominant and to be the identity element formula_19.\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nFor example, consider , for which is the Riemann sphere, an integral weight is specified simply by an integer , and . The line bundle is formula_20, whose sections are the homogeneous polynomials of degree (i.e. the \"binary forms\"). As a representation of , the sections can be written as , and is canonically isomorphic to . \\n\\nThis gives us at a stroke the representation theory of formula_21: formula_22 is the standard representation, and formula_23 is its th symmetric power. We even have a unified description of the action of the Lie algebra, derived from its realization as vector fields on the Riemann sphere: if , , are the standard generators of formula_21, then \\n\\nSection::::Positive characteristic.\\nOne also has a weaker form of this theorem in positive characteristic. Namely, let be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic formula_26. Then it remains true that formula_13 for all if is a weight such that formula_8 is non-dominant for all formula_7 as long as is \"close to zero\". This is known as the Kempf vanishing theorem. However, the other statements of the theorem do not remain valid in this setting.\\n\\nMore explicitly, let be a dominant integral weight; then it is still true that formula_13 for all formula_31, but it is no longer true that this -module is simple in general, although it does contain the unique highest weight module of highest weight as a -submodule. If is an arbitrary integral weight, it is in fact a large unsolved problem in representation theory to describe the cohomology modules formula_2 in general. Unlike over formula_33, Mumford gave an example showing that it need not be the case for a fixed that these modules are all zero except in a single degree .\\n\\nSection::::BorelâWeil theorem.\\nThe BorelâWeil theorem provides a concrete model for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups and irreducible holomorphic representations of complex semisimple Lie groups. These representations are realized in the spaces of global sections of holomorphic line bundles on the flag manifold of the group. The BorelâWeilâBott theorem is its generalization to higher cohomology spaces. The theorem dates back to the early 1950s and can be found in and .\\n\\nSection::::Statement of the theorem.\\nThe theorem can be stated either for a complex semisimple Lie group or for its compact form . Let be a connected complex semisimple Lie group, a Borel subgroup of , and the flag variety. In this scenario, is a complex manifold and a nonsingular algebraic . The flag variety can also be described as a compact homogeneous space , where is a (compact) Cartan subgroup of . An integral weight determines a holomorphic line bundle on and the group acts on its space of global sections,\\n\\nThe BorelâWeil theorem states that if is a \"dominant\" integral weight then this representation is a \"holomorphic\" irreducible highest weight representation of with highest weight . Its restriction to is an irreducible unitary representation of with highest weight , and each irreducible unitary representations of is obtained in this way for a unique value of . (A holomorphic representation of a complex Lie group is one for which the corresponding Lie algebra representation is \"complex\" linear.)\\n\\nSection::::Concrete description.\\nThe weight gives rise to a character (one-dimensional representation) of the Borel subgroup , which is denoted .

The movement was centered in Salonica. The group originated during and soon after the era of Sabbatai Zevi, a 17th-century Jewish kabbalist who claimed to be the Messiah and eventually converted to Islam under threat of death in order to escape punishment by the Sultan Mehmed IV. After Zevi\\'s conversion, a number of Jews followed him into Islam and became the DÃ¶nmeh. Since the 20th century, assimilated DÃ¶nmeh have intermarried with other groups and most have assimilated into Turkish society.\\n\\nSection::::Etymology.\\nThe Turkish word \"dÃ¶nme\" is from the verbal root \"dÃ¶n-\" that means \\'to turn\\', i.e., \"to convert\", but in a pejorative sense or \\'turncoat\\'. They are also called \"SelÃ¢nikli\" \"person from Thessaloniki\" or \"avdetÃ®\" \"religious convert\" ( \"âawdah\" \\'return\\'). Members of the group refer to themselves simply as \"the Believers\" in Hebrew ( \"ha-Ma\\'aminim\"), or \"sazanikos,\" Turkish for \"carp\" in honor of the changing outward nature of the fish. An alternate explanation of this self-nomenclature is the prophecy that Sabbatai Zevi would deliver the Jews under the sign of the fish.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nDespite their conversion to Islam, the Sabbateans secretly remained close to Judaism and continued to practice Jewish rituals covertly. They recognized Sabbatai Zevi (1626â1676) as the Jewish Messiah, observed certain commandments with similarities to those in Judaism, and prayed in Hebrew and later in Ladino. They also observed rituals celebrating important events in Zevi\\'s life and interpreted Zevi\\'s conversion in a Kabbalistic way.\\n\\nThere are several branches of the DÃ¶nmeh group. The first is the Ä°zmirli, formed in Ä°zmir (\"Smyrna\"). This was the original sect, from which two others eventually split. The first schism created the sect of the Jakubi, founded by Jacob Querido (ca. 1650â1690), the brother of Zevi\\'s last wife. Querido claimed to be Zevi\\'s reincarnation and a messiah in his own right. The second split from the Ä°zmirli was the result of claims that Berechiah Russo, known in Turkish as Osman Baba, was truly the next reincarnation of Zevi\\'s soul. These allegations gained following and gave rise to the Karakashi (Turkish), or Konioso (Ladino), branch, the most numerous and strictest branch of the DÃ¶nmeh. Missionaries from the Karakashi were active in Poland in the first part of the 18th century and taught Jacob Frank (1726â1791), the alleged heir of Russo\\'s soul. Frank went on to create the Frankist sect, another non-DÃ¶nmeh Sabbatean group in Eastern Europe. Yet another group, the Lechli, of Polish descent, lived in exile in Salonika (modern Thessaloniki, Greece) and Constantinople.\\n\\nAccording to anti-Semitic âIslamist and neo-Naziâ conspiracy theorists, several leading members of the Young Turk movement, a group of constitutional monarchist revolutionaries who brought down the Ottoman Empire, were DÃ¶nmeh. At the time of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, some among the Salonika DÃ¶nmeh tried to be recognized as non-Muslims to avoid being forced to leave the city. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1922â1923, the DÃ¶nmeh strongly supported the Republican, progressive reforms of AtatÃ¼rk that tried to restrict the power of the religious establishment and to modernize society. In particular, the DÃ¶nmeh were instrumental in establishing trade, industry, and culture in the emerging Republic of Turkey, which is partially due to the prominence of Rumeli immigrants in general, and of Salonika in particular, in the early Republic years.\\n\\nAn interesting case is the one of Ilgaz Zorlu, a DÃ¶nmeh publisher who founded \"Zvi Publishers\" in 2000 and sought recognition as a Jew, but a beth din refused to recognize his Jewishness without a full conversion. He claimed to have converted in Israel and then filed a lawsuit for changing his religion from Islam to Judaism in his registry records and identification. The court voted in his favor.\\n\\nIÅÄ±k University, which is the part of the Feyziye Schools Foundation (, FMV), and TerakkÃ® schools were founded by the DÃ¶nmeh community in Thessaloniki in the last quarter of the 19th century and continued their activities in Istanbul after Greeks captured the city on 9 November 1912.\\n\\nThere is a DÃ¶nmeh community in YenikÃ¶y, SarÄ±yer.\\n\\nThe independent scholar Rifat Bali defines the term \"dÃ¶nme\" as follows:\\n\\nSection::::Ideology.\\nThe DÃ¶nmeh ideology of the 17th century revolved primarily around the Eighteen Precepts, an abridged version of the Ten Commandments in which the admonition against adultery is explained as more of a precautionary measure than a ban, likely included to explain the antinomian sexual activities of the Sabbateans. The additional commandments are concerned with defining the kinds of interactions that may occur between the DÃ¶nmeh and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The most basic of these laws of interaction was to avoid marriage with either Jews or Muslims and to prefer relations within the sect to those outside of it. In spite of this, they maintained ties with Sabbateans who had not converted and even with Jewish rabbis, who secretly settled disputes within the DÃ¶nmeh concerning Jewish law.\\n\\nAs far as ritual was concerned, the DÃ¶nmeh followed both Jewish and Muslim traditions, shifting between one and the other as necessary for integration into Ottoman society. Outwardly Muslims and secretly Jewish Sabbateans, the DÃ¶nmeh observed traditional Muslim holidays like Ramadan but also kept the Jewish Sabbath, Brit milah and major holidays. Much of DÃ¶nmeh ritual is a combination of various elements of Kabbalah, Sabbateanism, Jewish traditional law, and Sufism.\\n\\nDÃ¶nmeh liturgy evolved as the sect grew and spread. At first, much of the DÃ¶nmeh literature was written in Hebrew. Later, as the group developed, Ladino replaced Hebrew as the prominent language and became not only the vernacular language, but also the liturgical language. Though the DÃ¶nmeh had branched into several sects, all of them held the view that Zevi was the divine messiah and that he had revealed the true \"spiritual Torah\" which was superior to the practical earthly Torah. The DÃ¶nmeh created and celebrated holidays pertaining to various points in Zevi\\'s life and their own history of conversion. Based at least partially in the Kabbalistic understanding of divinity, the DÃ¶nmeh believed that there was a three-way connection of the emanations of the divine, which engendered much conflict with Muslim and Jewish communities alike. The most notable source of opposition from other contemporary religions was the common practice of exchanging wives between members of the DÃ¶nmeh.\\n\\nThe hierarchy of the DÃ¶nmeh was based in branch divisions. The Ismirli lay at the top of the hierarchy, composed of merchant classes and intelligentsia. Artisans tended to be mostly Karakashi while lower classes were mostly Jakubi. Each branch had its own prayer community, organized into a \"Kahal,\" or congregation (Hebrew). An extensive internal economic network provided support for lower class DÃ¶nmeh in spite of ideological differences between branches.\\n\\nSection::::Anti-Semitic canards and alleged political entanglements.\\nTurkish anti-Semitism and the conspiracy theories upon which it relies are centred on the mysterious figure of the DÃ¶nmeh. According to historian Marc David Baer, the phenomenon has deep roots in late-Ottoman history, and its legacy of conspiratorial accusations persisted throughout the history of the Turkish Republic and is kept alive there today. Modern anti-Semitism racially essentializes the Jew as a ubiquitous, homogenous unit acting undercover in the guise of diverse global groups, inexorably in pursuit of global political and economic control via secretive channels. As a crypto-Sabbatean sect, the DÃ¶nmeh were always an easy target of canards about secret, âcrypto-Jewishâ political control and social influence, whether charged with setting in motion political upheaval against the status quo, or accused of shaping an oppressive regimeâs grip on the status quo.\\n\\nThe DÃ¶nmehâs history of Sabbatean theological and ritual secrecy grounded in Jewish tradition, coupled with public observance of Islam, make accusations of secret Jewish control convenient, according to Baer. âSecret Jew,â then, takes on a double meaning of being both secretly Jewish and Jews who act secretively to exert control; their secret religious identity in the first place is compatible, for conspiracy theorists, with their secretive influence, especially when they cannot be distinguished from ordinary Turkish Muslims who reside everywhere, and, as Baer argues, when the modern antisemite sees the Jew as necessarily âeverywhere.â The DÃ¶nmehâs maneuverings were said to have been at the core of Young Turk Revolution and their overthrow of the Sultan AbdÃ¼lhamid II, the dissolution of the Ottoman religious establishment, and the founding of a secular republic. Pro-Sultan, religious Muslim political opponents painted these events as a global Jewish and Freemason plot carried out by Turkeyâs secret Jews, the DÃ¶nmeh, with Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, the chief revolutionary and former member of the Committee for Union and Progress (CUP), a leading DÃ¶nmeh himself.\\n\\nAdditionally, the crypto-Jewish conspiracy claim has been used throughout modern Turkish history by rightists and Islamists to undermine the legitimacy of incumbent political leadership, and, today, by leftists and secularists seeking to undermine the political legitimacy of Erdogan and the origins of Islamism more broadly. These, like other claims of Jewish aspirations to world-domination, embodied in part by the successes of Zionism, join the ranks as examples of both the enduring nature of such canards in contemporary Turkey, and of their deep-seated relationship with pervasive, worldwide theories of political conspiracy propagated by radically different political elements often simultaneously.\\n\\nSection::::Mehmet KarakaÅzade RÃ¼ÅtÃ¼.\\nIn 1924, Mehmet KarakaÅzade RÃ¼ÅtÃ¼, a Karakash DÃ¶nmeh, made allegations about DÃ¶nmehs, branches and wife-swapping rituals to \"Vakit\" newspaper. He also accused Donmehs of lacking patriotism and not having been assimilated. Discussions spread into other newspapers including the ones owned by DÃ¶nmeh groups. Ahmet Emin Yalman, in the newspaper (\"Vatan\") he owned, accepted the existence of such groups, but claimed that those groups were no longer following their traditions. Then KarakaÅzade RÃ¼ÅtÃ¼ petitioned the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to request the abolition of some DÃ¶nmehs\\' ongoing immigration from Macedonia by population exchange.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'DÃ¶nmeh', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7259439'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'nAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7259616', 'text': 'UFO\\'s and the Men Who Fly Them!\\n\\nUFO\\'s and the Men Who Fly Them! is a 1996 Man or Astro-man? 7\" EP released jointly by Jezz Thorpe (Drug Racer) and Henry Owings of Chunklet (magazine) on Drug Racer Records.

The patent dated 1439 is the earliest surviving such grant of arms made to a corporate body in England. The arms were modified in 1561, when the crest was added and the lion supporters granted. These grants were superseded in 1613 with minor modifications. The Queen as Freeman of the Fraternity possesses a small jewelled and enamelled brooch depicting its arms and circumscribed by the motto, known as \"The Drapers Company Badge\". She wears the brooch when performing royal engagements connected with the Drapers Company. The modern blazon is: \"Azure, three clouds radiated proper each adorned with a triple crown or\". The triple crown contains a cap (velvet/fabric lining visible through the gold structure) \"gules\".\\n\\nSection::::Original grant.\\nThe Drapers Company received its original grant of arms in 1439, from Sir William Bruges, Garter King of Arms. The \"Fraternity\" was founded under the protection of \"Blessed Mary the Virgin of the Mystery\" which is reflected in the iconography of the arms. The Garter King explained his design of the arms as follows:\\nThe original arms had supporters of two angels.\\n\\nSection::::Greenway Porch depiction (1517).\\nAn elaborate pre-Reformation relief stonework sculpture, showing the Drapers Company arms in a relevant context, survives in the \"Greenway Porch\", built in 1517 against the south wall of St Peter\\'s Church in Tiverton, Devon, by the wealthy merchant John Greenway (d.1529), a member of the Drapers Company and of the Merchant Adventurers Company. It shows Greenway (left, with monogram \"JG\" in a quatrefoil above) and his wife kneeling on either side of the Virgin Mary who is ascending into Heaven. Below the Virgin is an heraldic escutcheon showing the arms of the Drapers Company (\"Azure, three clouds radiated proper each adorned with a triple crown or\"), with the very rarely surviving pre-Reformation angel supporters, the Virgin being the patroness of the Drapers Company.\\n\\nSection::::1561 amendments.\\nIn 1561, two decades after the Reformation, the arms were inspected and confirmed by William Harvey, Clarenceux King of Arms. A new crest was granted of \"A golden ram\", and the angel supporters were replaced by \"Two lions or pelletÃ©e\".\\n\\nSection::::1613 amendments.\\nIn 1613 the Imperial crowns were modified in shape and a motto was granted, namely: \"Unto God only be Honour and Glory\". The\\nnew grant was made on 6 June 1613 by Garter King of Arms Sir William Segar, with blazon as follows:\\n\\nThe supporters are \"Two lions or pelletÃ©e\" (\"Two gold lions covered with black roundels\"). The crest is blazoned: \"On a wreath of their colours a mount vert thereon a ram jacent fleeced gold armed and unguled sable\" (\"On a braided wreath of blue and gold cord sstands a green hill on top of which lies gold ram with head raised and with black horns and hooves\"). The mantle (cloth covering the helmet) is blazoned: \"Gules, doubled argent\" (\"red lined with white\")\\n\\nSection::::Symbolism.\\nA number of explanations of the symbolism of the Drapers\\' arms have been postulated.\\nThe Company\\'s patron is the Virgin Mary, and each of the grants of arms are clear that this is to whom the triple crowns refer. Mary was deemed to be an empress and the symbol for an emperor/empress is a triple crown. However, as the Pope has long used (until 1963) the \"Papal Tiara\" or triple crown, as a symbol of his temporal and spiritual power, the symbol used in the Drapers\\' arms may have become politically tainted at the time of the Reformation when England declared independence from papal authority. This may explain the clarifications which were required in the 16th and 17th century grants.\\n\\nThe symbolism is likely to represent The Assumption of the Virgin. It has been suggested that the arms demonstrate that from Mary, through the Holy Spirit, comes the divine Son of God: thus the sunbeams represent the brilliance and light of the Virgin Mary, and the cloud which is a frequent symbol for the Holy Spirit. Another suggestion is that the crowned clouds are mistaken renderings of pyx-canopies, that is veils (as would be sold by drapers) hanging from pyxes.\\n\\nThe triple repetition of this main charge follows standard heraldic usage for charges of all kinds, but here also serves to emphasise the Trinity.\\n\\nSection::::Motto.\\nThe motto is: \"Unto God only be Honour and Glory\".\\n\\n', 'title': 'Coat of arms of the Drapers Company', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=727584'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'pwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7275936', 'text': \"Western station (CTA Blue Line O'Hare branch)\\n\\nWestern is a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system, serving the Blue Line, on North Western Avenue near West Armitage Avenue.

Ekinci demanded to go to Rome to speak with the Pope, but Greek and Italian F-16 Fighting Falcon jets intercepted and escorted the aircraft until it landed in Brindisi, Italy. Nobody was harmed, and Ekinci was jailed in Italy while awaiting trial. At first, the hijacking incident was linked with the envisaged visit of Pope Benedict XVI to Turkey, but later it was ascertained that Ekinci was seeking to request political asylum from Italy. On October 4, a Turkish Airlines plane was sent to take the other passengers to Istanbul.\\n\\nSection::::Hijacking.\\nOn October 3, 2006, the Boeing 737-4Y0 took off from Tirana bound for Istanbul. It was hijacked by Hakan Ekinci in Greek airspace at 14:58 UTC and was intercepted and forced by Italian F-16 Fighting Falcon interceptor jets to land at the southern Italian Adriatic port city of Brindisi. There were 113 people on board: 107 passengers and six crew members. At first it was reported that there were two hijackers, but later it was confirmed that the sole hijacker lied about the existence of an accomplice.\\n\\nAn official from Greek Ministry of National Defence said the plane had entered Greek air space at 14:58 (UTC). The pilots transmitted the hijack squawk code twice at 14:55 (UTC), while the aircraft was cruising about 25\\xa0kilometres (15\\xa0mi) north of Thessaloniki. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato reported that the hijacker slipped into the cockpit with a package which could have been a bomb when flight attendants opened the cockpit door, and the pilots acted according to the international rules in the matter and did what the hijacker wanted. The flight\\'s captain reported in Istanbul that \"while the chief stewardess entered the cockpit to ask if we needed anything, the terrorist entered by force. I tried to push him out but he was a big man and I failed to stop him\". The captain went on to say that the hijacker said he had three friends and they had explosives. He wanted to go Rome to speak with the Pope, and Italian Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato reported that, the hijacker added there are other hijackers on another unspecified plane, \"would blow that plane up if the missive didn\\'t get to the pope\". The captain reported to the air-traffic controller in Thessaloniki that \"he had two undesirables who wished to go to Italy to see the Pope and to give him a message\". Four Greek F-16 fighter jets took off and accompanied the plane until it left Greek airspace. Once in Italian airspace, two Italian F-16s intercepted, escorted, and forced it to land in Brindisi Airport in Brindisi. The airline spokesman said that Greek officials had alerted their Italian counterparts about the hijacking incident.\\n\\nSection::::Passenger accounts.\\nPassengers said that the hijacker used no violence. Sabri Abazi, an Albanian member of parliament, who was a passenger on the flight, spoke to ANSA news agency by mobile phone on board. Abazi said that there was one hijacker in the cockpit and another in the cabin, and added that he saw no weapons. Passenger ErgÃ¼n ErkÃ¶seoÄlu said \"I didn\\'t see any suspicious behaviour of the hijacker. Airplane took off and after 20 minutes later, captain announced that due to technical malfunction we would land in Italy instead of Istanbul\". Aviation authorities said that after all the passengers had left the plane, police questioned the hijacker. Abazi said that he saw only one hijacker but had been told by a flight attendant that there were two hijackers on board. Istanbul Governor Muammer GÃ¼ler reported that the hijacker Ekinci lied to the airliner\\'s pilots that he had at least one accomplice.\\n\\nSection::::Upon landing.\\nItalian police, military, and fire brigade vehicles surrounded the plane and the Italian news agency ANSA reported that police detained both hijackers. Brindisi Police Chief, Salvatore De Paolis, told Reuters \"they will request political asylum\". In an interview with reporters, a fire rescue official said \"The two hijackers want to speak to journalists so they can send a message to the Pope and explain why they did this.\" Amoto reported that the hijacker wanted to deliver a message for Pope Benedict XVI, but stated he did not have a written letter.\\n\\nHijacker Hakan Ekinci\\'s protest took six hours, and after his surrender the hijacker apologized to the captain and shook his hand; he also apologized to the passengers. CNN TÃ¼rk reported that there were 107 passengers, 80 of them Albanian and five Turkish.\\n\\nAfter the incident a Tirana airport video was released to Reuters showing Ekinci being checked by security. He was body searched and passed through a metal detector, then removed his belt, sweater, and emptied his pockets, but was cleared to proceed to his flight.\\n\\nEkinci was arrested in Italy after interrogation. Turkish Minister of Justice Cemil ÃiÃ§ek reported that there would not be a direct return request to the Italian Ministry of Justice until the Chief Public Prosecutor\\'s Office and Ministry of Internal Affairs had completed their work on the subject. They then requested the return of Ekinci. Giuseppe Giannuzzi, prosecutor of the hijacking incident, said to The Associated Press in an interview that the hijacker will remain in jail until the end of the trial which will presumably take two years after inception. Giannuzzi has charged Ekinci with hijacking and considered other charges like terrorism and kidnapping, if Ekinci is sentenced for hijacking he will be imprisoned for 7 to 21 years.\\n\\nSection::::Possible motives.\\nSeveral theories have emerged as to the motives for the hijacking. At first Turkish media reported police sources as saying the hijacking was in protest at the envisaged visit of Pope Benedict XVI, who has offended many Muslims with a recent speech linking the spread of the Islamic faith to violence. But later it was reported that the hijacker sought political asylum in Italy due to his conscientious objection to serving in the military.\\n\\nAt first, Turkish media reported that there were two hijackers, Hakan Ekinci and Mehmet ErtaÅ, but later it was ascertained that Ekinci was alone and ErtaÅ was innocent. According to the report of Turkey\\'s Ministry of Justice, first information about hijacking incident were retrieved via Interpol and authorities reported ErtaÅ\\'s name as hijacker based on Interpol\\'s report but after more investigations it was ascertained that ErtaÅ was innocent.\\n\\nTurkish officials reported the hijacker\\'s name as Hakan Ekinci, born in 1978 in Buca, who is known to have written a letter to the Pope in August 2006. He wrote, \"I am a Christian and don\\'t want to serve a Muslim army\". He also wrote that he had been attending church since 1998. Istanbul Governor Muammer GÃ¼ler reported that, Ekinci, who has been identified as a Christian convert by the Turkish media and by chief prosecutor Giuseppe Giannuzzi\\'s reporting near Lecce, is a conscientious objector Catholic and has dodged his military conscription. He left Istanbul on May 6, 2006 and had gone to Albania. Turkey\\'s Consulate General in Tirana then filed for his deportation. If he had landed in Turkey, Hakan Ekinci was certain to be interned as a draft-dodger, since the Consulate had reported the order for his deportation to the police at AtatÃ¼rk International Airport. Authorities had been investigating him since September 1 on the draft-dodging charge.\\n\\nPope Benedict XVI visited Ankara, Istanbul, and Ephesus as a guest of the Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer between November 28 and December 1, 2006. Vatican City officials reported that the Pope was informed of the hijacking incident but the preparations for his trip would not be affected.\\n\\nSection::::Passengersâ compensation flight.\\nAlthough the hijacker was found to have acted alone, Italian police took statements from passengers and searched the aircraft and baggage for a possible accomplice, and due to this process, passengers stayed in Italy during the night. On October 4, a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737, was sent from Turkey to bring the passengers back to Istanbul. The plane departed from Brindisi Airport at 4:15 (UTC) and landed in Istanbul at 5:40 (UTC) with 105 passengers, with the exception of the hijacker who had been arrested in Brindisi, and a passenger who wanted to remain in Italy.\\n', 'title': 'Turkish Airlines Flight 1476', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7276105'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '727753', 'text': 'Franz Vranitzky\\n\\nFranz Vranitzky (born 4 October 1937) is an Austrian politician.

He attended the Realgymnasium Geblergasse and studied economics, graduating in 1960. He financed his studies teaching Latin and English and as a construction worker.\\n\\nAs a young man, Vranitzky played basketball and was a member of Austria\\'s national team, which in 1960 unsuccessfully tried to qualify for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.\\n\\nIn 1962 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÃ).\\n\\nIn 1962, Vranitzky married Christine Christen, with whom he fathered two children.\\n\\nVranitzky began his career in 1961 at Siemens-Schuckert, but within the year switched to the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austriaâs central bank. In 1969, he received a doctorate in International business studies. The following year, Hannes Androsch, minister of finance under Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, appointed him economic and financial advisor. Vranitzky served as deputy director of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein (1976â1981), briefly as its director general and as director general of the Ãsterreichische LÃ¤nderbank (1981â1984).\\n\\nIn 1984, Vranitzky joined the SPÃ-Freedom Party (FPÃ) government coalition under Chancellor Fred Sinowatz as minister of finance. He was criticized for receiving multiple compensations from his various functions in government-run businesses.\\n\\nSection::::Chancellor of Austria.\\nIn the presidential elections of 1986, Chancellor Sinowatz vociferously opposed Kurt Waldheim, the candidate of the Austrian People\\'s Party (ÃVP) opposition. The former UN Secretary General\\'s campaign for office caused international controversy due to allegations about his role as a German army officer in World War II. When Waldheim was elected on 8 June, Sinowatz resigned from the government, proposing Vranitzky as his successor.\\n\\nVranitzky entered his new office on 16 June 1986. At first he continued the government coalition with the Freedom Party. On 13 September 1986, however, radical FPÃ politician JÃ¶rg Haider was elected chairman of his party, ousting the moderate Vice Chancellor Norbert Steger. Vranitzky ended cooperation with his coalition partner and had parliament dissolved.\\n\\nIn the subsequent elections on 23 November 1986, the SPÃ remained the strongest party. In January 1987, Vranitzky formed a government, based on a \"grand coalition\" with the second-largest party, the Christian democrat ÃVP, with Alois Mock serving as vice-chancellor and foreign minister. In 1988, Vranitzky also succeeded Fred Sinowatz as chairman of his party.\\n\\nUntil 1992, Austria\\'s foreign policy had to deal with the repercussions of the Waldheim controversy, as the Austrian president was shunned in some diplomatic circles. The United States regarded Waldheim as a persona non grata, thereby barring him from entering the country in 1987, while Israel had recalled its ambassador after Waldheim\\'s election. Vranitzky managed to normalise Austria\\'s relations with both countries and frequently stepped in to perform diplomatic duties commonly assigned to the president.\\n\\nOn 8 July 1991, in a speech in parliament, Vranitzky acknowledged a share in the responsibility for the pain brought, not by Austria as a state, but by citizens of this country, upon other people and peoples\", thereby departing from the hitherto official portrayal of Austria as \"Hitler\\'s first victim.\"\\n\\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Vranitzky focused on furthering relations with the nations of Eastern Europe and membership in the European Union, of which Vranitzky and his foreign minister, Alois Mock, were strong advocates. After a referendum on 12 June 1994 resulted in 66% in favour of EU membership, Austria joined the European Union in January 1995. Austria\\'s military neutrality, which had been espoused during the Cold War, was reaffirmed in the process.\\n\\nIn party politics, Vranitzky kept his distance from JÃ¶rg Haider\\'s Freedom Party - a stance the latter decried as a \"policy of exclusion.\" In the election of 1990, Vranitzky\\'s coalition government was confirmed when the Social Democrat vote remained stable while the ÃVP lost 17 seats, mainly to the FPÃ. The 1994 election saw heavy losses by both coalition parties, which nonetheless remained the two largest parties, while FPÃ and others made further gains. Vranitzky renewed the coalition with the ÃVP, which after May 1995 was led by foreign minister Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel. Later in the year, the grand coalition broke apart over budget policy, leading to the elections of December 1995, which however only saw slight changes in favor of SPÃ and ÃVP. Vranitzky and SchÃ¼ssel resumed their coalition in March 1996.\\n\\nIn January 1997, Vranitzky resigned as Chancellor and as party chairman. He was succeeded in both positions by his minister of finance, Viktor Klima.\\n\\nSection::::Later activities.\\nAfter leaving office, Vranitzky served as Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe representative for Albania from March to October 1997, before returning into the banking sector, as political consultant to the WestLB bank. In December, he was elected to the board of governors of automotive supplier Magna. He later occupied the same position for the tourism company TUI and Magic Life hotels.\\n\\nIn June 2005, he donated one of his kidneys to his wife Christine, who suffered from chronic kidney failure.\\n\\nHe actively supported his party\\'s frontrunner Alfred Gusenbauer in the 2006 elections. During the campaign it was revealed, that in 1999, Vranitzky had received a million Austrian schillings as a consultant to the BAWAG bank, which was then under public scrutiny. It was alleged that the payment was made without any service in return and that it constituted an \"indirect party funding\". Vranitzky denounced the allegations.\\n\\nVranitzky chairs the quarterly \"Vranitzky colloquia\", organised by the study group WiWiPol, which discusses economic topics and their impact on Austria and Europe.

He entered the Spanish army at age 17 and was sent to Italy as an ensign of grenadiers of the Royal Guard. In 1750 he transferred to the Walloon Guards, bodyguards of the Bourbon kings of Spain. In 1756 he was promoted to lieutenant and was made a knight in the Teutonic Order. He became a colonel (still in the Walloon Guards) in 1760.\\n\\nIn 1766 he came to New Spain as a captain in the guard of Viceroy Carlos Francisco de Croix, marquÃ©s de Croix. He subsequently served as commandant of the fortress in Acapulco and as inspector of all troops in the viceroyalty. He served in this capacity until 1770. In 1771 the term of Viceroy Croix ended, and both Francisco and Teodoro returned to Spain. \"Visitador\" JosÃ© de GÃ¡lvez returned with them.\\n\\nSection::::Provincias Internas del Norte.\\nThe Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas del Norte (\"Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North\") was established in New Spain in 1776, incorporating Nueva Vizcay, Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico, Nuevo LeÃ³n, Coahuila, Sonora y Sinaloa, Las Californias, and Spanish Texas. This arrangement was a response to numerous attacks by Apaches, Seris, Comanches, and other Indigenous tribes and to the fear of encroachment by other European powers. Headquarters was to be at Arizpe, Sonora.\\n\\nOn May 16, 1776, King Charles III of Spain named Brigadier Teodoro de Croix the first commandant general of the new jurisdiction. He replaced Hugo OconÃ³r, an appointee of New Spain Viceroy Antonio MarÃ­a de Bucareli y UrsÃºa, in charge of Spanish forces on the northern frontier. He was independent of the viceroy of New Spain in most of this territory, but in Alta California the two were to share jurisdiction.\\n\\nCroix assumed his office on January 1, 1777. He left Mexico City to inspect his new jurisdiction in August. He was responsible for military defense, civilian colonization and conversion of the Indians over the large, sparsely inhabited territory. Croix reported directly to the minister of the Indies, JosÃ© de GÃ¡lvez.\\n\\nHe built up the strongest military force across the northern frontier from Texas to Sonora than had ever been seen in the area, revamping the whole border defense in the process. On October 24, 1781, the king approved the separation of the Californias as a jurisdiction at the level of the Provincias Internas de Occidente.\\n\\nSection::::Viceroy of Peru.\\nCroix was appointed lieutenant general and named viceroy of Peru on February 13, 1783. He relinquished command in the Provincias Internas del Norte to Felipe de Neve.\\n\\nAs viceroy of Peru, he decentralized the government through the creation of seven \"intendencias\".

The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out \"amae\" may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of \"amae\", but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.\\n\\nSection::::In literary context.\\nDoi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while \"amae\" is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that \"amae\" is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs. Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (\"sasshi\" ), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (\"enryo\" ), and the \"tatemaeâhonne\" dynamics are communicative manifestations of the \"amae\" psychology of Japanese people.\\nDoi translates \"amaeru\" as \"to depend and presume upon another\\'s benevolence\". It indicates, for Doi, \"helplessness and the desire to be loved\". \"Amaeru\" can also be defined as \"to wish to be loved\", and denotes dependency needs. \"Amae\" is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one\\'s perceived needs.\\n\\nDoi says,\\nAccording to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:\\n\"Amae\" may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, \"amae\" does have a connotation of immaturity, but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of romance so common in the West.\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nDoi\\'s work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in nihonjinron studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P. 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)\\n\\nDoi\\'s work has been hailed as a distinctive contribution to psychoanalysis by the American psychiatrist Frank Johnson, who has devoted a full book-length study to Doi and to his critics.\\n\\nSection::::Publication history.\\nIt was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by John Bester was later published in 1973.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'The Anatomy of Dependence', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7282253'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7282479', 'text': 'AOL OpenRide\\n\\nAOL OpenRide was an Internet application suite made by AOL that combined e-mail, instant-messaging, a web browser and a media player in one window.

He tied for first in the 1973-74 Junior Canadian Chess Championship, but lost the playoff match to John MacPhail. One of his key early tournament victories came in the 1974 Montreal Championship, where he scored 5Â½/6. He had reached national master strength by this time, just before his twentieth birthday. He attended McGill University, studying engineering, and was an excellent student; however, he left McGill before completing his degree, in favour of becoming a chess professional. Spraggett spent his early years developing his game in minor Canadian and American Swiss system open events, where the prizes were often low. His younger brother Grant is also a strong player, having earned the FIDE Master (FM) title.\\n\\nHe was awarded the IM title in 1975, following a second-place finish at the Zonal Canadian Chess Championship in Calgary; Peter Biyiasas won. Spraggett raised his game to meet the challenge of the powerful Soviet defector Igor V. Ivanov, who had settled in Montreal in the early 1980s. Those years saw Spraggett attain success in several strong tournaments, with victories in the 1983 World Open, 1984 Commonwealth Championship, 1984 New York Open, and 1985 Commonwealth Championship. He did not play an international-standard grandmaster round-robin tournament until Wijk aan Zee early in 1985, just after his thirtieth birthday, at which time he was the highest-rated IM in the world.\\n\\nSpraggett won his first of seven Canadian titles in 1984, which qualified him into the Taxco Interzonal the next year. His fourth-place result at Taxco 1985, where he topped many more famous players, automatically earned the International Grandmaster title, and seeded him to the Candidates event, the first Canadian to achieve this. He came in last at Montpellier Candidates 1985, but qualified again for the next Candidates. In his first-round match at Saint John, 1988, Spraggett defeated world #3 Andrei Sokolov in a blitz playoff. He then lost in extra games in the 1989 Candidates' quarterfinal round to Soviet Grand Master Artur Yusupov at Quebec City.\\n\\nSpraggett has followed up with mostly superb performances in eight Chess Olympiads, eight victories in the Canadian Open Championship, and a host of tournament victories in Europe. Spraggett is widely considered to be the strongest chess player in Canadian history. His FIDE rating peaked at 2633, in January 2007, at age 52, and in the late 1980s he was ranked consistently amongst the top 100 players in the world. Spraggett has lived in Portugal since the late 1980s, and plays most of his tournaments in Europe, although he visits North America every year or two on average, to compete there. His best recent finishes include a victory at the Figueira da Foz International Chess Festival (December 2008, with 7Â½/9) and a clear second place at the CalviÃ  Open (in October 2007, with 7/9).\\n\\n\\nSection::::Playing style.\\nSpraggett is a solid positional player, who has the capability of developing sharp tactics against any opponent, but generally these tactics flow naturally and harmoniously from the position, instead of being overly forced. During his career, he has essayed a very wide range of openings, from sharp Sicilian Defences with either color, to complex King's Indian and Dutch Defences, to quieter lines such as the Caro-Kann and Queen's Indian Defences, and more subtle RÃ©ti and English Openings as White. This extensive range makes him very difficult to prepare for. Spraggett is also a strong endgame player. A true universalist of the chessboard, his style perhaps most closely resembles that of former World Champion Vasily Smyslov.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Kevin Spraggett', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7286821'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7286851', 'text': 'Nearctic (horse)\\n\\nNearctic (February 11, 1954 â 27 July 1973) was a Canadian-bred Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse. \\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nBred by E.

He pitched in Major League Baseball for ten seasons between 1886 and 1896. In several seasons, Chamberlain finished in his league\\'s top ten in a number of pitching categories, including wins, earned run average, strikeouts, and shutouts. During one of his best seasons, the 1888 St. Louis Browns won the American Association pennant with a 92â43 record. Although a righthanded pitcher, Chamberlain pitched the last two innings of an 1888 game with his left hand.\\n\\nChamberlain finished his major league career with 264 complete games out of his 301 games started. After his playing days, he was hired as a baseball umpire and later announced that he was becoming a boxer, but neither venture seems to have worked out. Not much is known about Chamberlain\\'s later life. He died in Baltimore in 1929.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nChamberlain was born on November 5, 1867 in Warsaw, New York. He was one of six children born to veterinary surgeon Irving Chamberlain and his wife Carrie. Moving to Buffalo as a child, Chamberlain began to play organized baseball as a teenager. His early professional career included stints in Hamilton, Ontario and with a Southern League team in Macon, Georgia. As a 17-year-old pitcher with Hamilton, he earned 18 wins and led the league in strikeouts.\\n\\nChamberlain made his major league debut with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association on September 13, 1886. In early October, Chamberlain was pitching in a game against the Baltimore Orioles when Louisville players began to complain that opposing pitcher Matt Kilroy was leaving the pitcher\\'s box when he threw the ball. When the umpire did not respond to Louisville\\'s complaints, Chamberlain\\'s manager told him to run forward out of the box when he let go of his pitches. The move \"scared the Baltimore batters out of their wits\" and Kilroy did not deliver any more questionable pitches.\\n\\nIn 1887, Chamberlain won 18 games for Louisville. The right-hander, who stood and weighed 168\\xa0lbs., earned the nickname \"Ice Box\". Some sources attribute the nickname to his ability to remain cool when facing tough opposition, but at least one source links the nickname to chronic laziness. On May 9, 1888, while pitching against the Kansas City Cowboys, Chamberlain pitched righthanded for the first seven innings and lefthanded for the last two innings. Louisville won the game by a score of 18â6. He was the third major league pitcher to throw with both his left and right hands during the same game. The feat was not repeated in the major leagues until Greg Harris switched arms for the ninth inning of a 1995 game.\\n\\nChamberlain was traded to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already registered 14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in the last six weeks of the season. He struck out 176 batters and registered a 2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league\\'s pitchers. The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face a trio of New York Giants pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.\\n\\nAfter Chamberlain pitched a shutout in the second game of the 1888 World Series, he lost the fourth, sixth and eighth games. Chamberlain gave up 11 runs in the eighth game. Though the Giants clinched the series after that game, they played a full ten games, with Chamberlain winning the last game. The series was Chamberlain\\'s last major league postseason playing appearance.\\n\\nSection::::Middle career.\\nThe Cincinnati Reds talked to St. Louis about acquiring Chamberlain in 1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him. That year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games and finished with 32 wins; his win total was the third highest in the league. Following the 1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players\\' League. A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players had served as a union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the group\\'s new league was attempting to compete with established baseball. Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain would jump to the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed to match the $800 pay increase that Chamberlain would have gotten in Chicago.\\n\\nChamberlain had returned to Buffalo by May 1890, where he was reported to be hanging out in pool rooms. Rumors held that Chamberlain wanted to join the Brotherhood and that he was \"playing for his release.\" He was sold to the Columbus Solons (also of the American Association) the next month. Chamberlain had appeared in five games for St. Louis and pitched in 25 more for Columbus by the end of the season. He finished the year with a league-leading six shutouts. In February 1891, Chamberlain pleaded guilty to a charge of aiding and abetting a prize fight. He received a $50 fine and the Columbus team declared that they would not retain him for the 1891 season.\\n\\nThe Philadelphia Athletics indicated immediate interest in Chamberlain, hoping that he would pitch most of the team\\'s games. Chamberlain earned a 22â23 win-loss record in 1891. He was the losing pitcher in the last of 485 shutouts recorded in the few seasons of American Association play. In August, he gave up the longest home run that had been hit at Boston\\'s Congress Street Grounds. Chamberlain pitched for the NL\\'s Cincinnati Reds in 1892, compiling a 19â23 record. In May of that season, Chamberlain pitched in an unusual game that was suspended due to sunlight; the scoreless game was in extra innings when umpire Jack Sheridan ruled that the sun was too bright for players to see the ball. The 1892 Reds finished with an overall record of 82â68. League officials split the season into two halves and the Reds finished fourth and eighth in the respective halves.\\n\\nBefore the 1893 season, Chamberlain indicated his displeasure with the climate in Cincinnati and said that he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16â12 and 10â9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe\\'s home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.\\n\\nSection::::Later career and life.\\nChamberlain had agreed to play for the Cleveland Spiders in 1895, but instead he joined a Class D baseball team out of Warren, Ohio in the Iron and Oil League. Future Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner played on the team. Years later, Wagner recalled Chamberlain as an experienced pitcher who shared his baseball knowledge with his young teammates. He reported to the Spiders in 1896. The team featured Cy Young and young pitchers such as Cy Swaim and Zeke Wilson. Chamberlain was released after appearing in two games.\\n\\nChamberlain finished his major league career with a 157â120 win-loss record and a 3.57 earned run average. Though he only finished among the top ten in complete games in two of his seasons, Chamberlain completed 264 of his 301 games started. His complete game total was ranked 64th on the all-time major league list after the 2013 season. Chamberlain also hit nine home runs, including a grand slam, during his major league career.\\n\\nIn early 1898, \"The Montreal Gazette\" reported that NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire for the coming season. Chamberlain did not ultimately work for the NL because he was unhappy with the salary that he was offered. He played local semi-amateur baseball in Buffalo and then announced that he was leaving baseball to become a boxer. He challenged Jack Baty, a black fighter, to a boxing match and posted a $500 bet on the fight. There is no record of Chamberlain boxing against Baty or anyone else, and little is known about his life after the major leagues.\\n\\nChamberlain briefly played minor league baseball for the 1899 Buffalo Bisons in the Western League. He did not win any games for Buffalo. In 1904, \"Sporting Life\" reported that the pitcher had a brother, F. Earl Chamberlain, who was named a Pacific Coast League umpire. Elton died of colon cancer at the age of 61. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Ice Box Chamberlain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7289138'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'tAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7290518', 'text': \"Old Tampa Children's Home\\n\\nThe Old Tampa Children's Home (also known as the Good Samaritan Inn) is a historic home in Tampa, Florida.

When his parents died, leaving him orphaned at the age of 12, Sherman moved to Boston, where he began working as a clerk in Boston mercantile houses four years later.\\n\\nHe soon moved to New York City, and in 1831, resettled in Newport, Kentucky, where he engaged in the manufacture of cotton bagging. On April 27, 1835, Sherman married Catharine Isabel Cox (1815â1865) of Frankfort, Kentucky with whom he eventually had 8 children. Sherman\\'s business prospered and he became well known and influential in the community.\\n\\nSection::::Texas Revolution and the Republic of Texas.\\nIn November 1835, a public meeting was held in neighboring Cincinnati to encourage support for Texas in her struggle against the Mexican government. A number of Cincinnatians and Northern Kentuckians pledged funding for ammunition and weapons (including the two artillery pieces later famous as the \"Twin Sisters\" of the Battle of San Jacinto). They left via riverboat to start their journey for Texas on January 6, 1836, with Sherman serving as captain of the company, which called itself the \"Kentucky Rifles.\" Local citizens helped fund uniforms and donated a flag.\\n\\nSherman arrived in Texas in late January, and joined the main Texian Army or Texas Army gathering near Gonzales on February 3. On March 12, many of the new volunteers for the army joined with Sam Houston and were organized into one regiment, with Edward Burleson elected colonel and Sherman his lieutuenant. With volunteers still streaming into Texas, enough men were recruited to fill out a second regiment. On April 8, the army was reorganized and the Second Regiment formed with Sherman as its colonel, though his old company remained in the First Regiment. Sherman led his troops at the Battle of San Jacinto, and they are weâre generally credited as first uttering the famous warcry, \"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\"\\n\\nIn August, Sherman became colonel of the cavalry of the new Republic of Texas and returned home to Kentucky to recruit more men for the Texan army. For his services in the revolution, he was granted large tracts of land as a token of gratitude by the legislature. When he returned to Texas in December, he brought his wife and her young 11-year-old brother back with him, settling near San Jacinto Bay and constructing a small home. Other family members soon settled nearby, although yellow fever killed Sherman\\'s brother Dana and his sister-in-law. Sherman served in the cavalry commander\\'s role until mid-December 1837.\\n\\nSherman was a member of the Texas House of Representatives, from Harris County, during the Seventh Congress, November 4, 1842, to January 17, 1843. He introduced a bill providing for the election of a Major General of Militia for the protection of the frontier, which was passed over the veto of President Sam Houston. Thomas J. Rusk briefly assumed the position, with Sherman as his successor in mid-1843.\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nIn 1846, General Sherman purchased 4,000 acres (16\\xa0kmÂ²) of land near Harrisburg and began promoting the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway (later part of the Southern Pacific system). He constructed a mansion in 1847, as well as a nearby sawmill. However, both were lost in separate fires within a decade. Without insurance and having lost most of his fortune, he moved to Galveston and opened a hotel.\\n\\nDuring the American Civil War, Sherman was requested by the local Committee of Safety of the union to take full charge of affairs at Galveston, with full authority to put the island in a state of defense. In 1862 he moved with his family to his old home on the San Jacinto Bay and with them went former Republic of Texas President David G. Burnet.

Stackpole, Scott Bennie, Mark O\\'Green, and Liz Danforth. The canceled 1997 game \"\" notwithstanding, this game marks the last time DeForest Kelley played the role of Leonard McCoy.

The magazine concluded that although experienced adventurers would finish the game quickly, \"it would be a shame for Star Trek fanatics to miss out on \"Judgment Rites\"\". Charles Ardai said in April 1994 that \"Judgment Rites\" \"is a better game in any number of ways\" than its predecessor, with optional and less combat, more and larger episodes, a unified plot thread, and bigger roles for supporting characters.\\n\\n\"Judgment Rites\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1993 \"Adventure Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"\" and \"Day of the Tentacle\" (tie).

Any proceeds in addition to expenses go to fostering new programs, support services or community welfare programs. They also do not sell air time â programs are broadcast at no cost. The provision of finance is not a consideration in determining which programs will go to air on the channel. Programs are selected on merit and their potential placement within the schedule.\\n\\nSection::::Vision.\\nSection::::Faith.\\nThe foundation stones of ACCTV are VISION and FAITH. The vision for ACCTV is to see the Good News message of Christ broadcast through the Australian media platforms. The journey of faith began in 1987 when a vision was birthed to see a Christian-based television channel established in Australia. What began as an impossible dream became a reality on Easter Sunday 1999, when ACCTV commenced a 24-hour broadcast on Optus Television. From humble beginnings ACCTV has grown steadily and is now available on most subscription television services in Australia.\\n\\nâFaith is taking the first step even when you donât see the whole staircase.â Martin Luther King Jr.\\n\\nFaith is also like a muscle that requires stress and pressure to make it strong. This analogy relates to the development of ACCTV. By God\\'s Grace and providence we will continue to build on the foundation that has been laid and establish a Christian media platform that is a World leader in the area of faith- based broadcasting.\\n\\nSection::::Hope.\\nIn a world where there is a desperate need for hope and encouragement, ACCTV is intentional in its efforts to provide a platform where people are encouraged, enriched and inspired with a sense of Hope. Hope is more than just a matter of turning on the TV, it\\'s connecting with the message of hope and discovering a life of meaning and purpose, based on the âHope of the Worldâ â the person of Jesus. âNow faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.â There is a distinct link between faith and hope and in faith we hold onto the hope and believe that one day every home in Australia will have access to ACCTV. âHope never fails.â\\n\\nSection::::Love.\\nâLove always protects, love always hopes, love always trusts, love always perseveres.â Love is our motivation. It\\'s at the core of everything we do. Our love for God compels us to work with integrity and excellence. The outworking of this love is to see ACCTV become the very best it can possibly be. We are passionate about sourcing the best programs to inspire, encourage and offer hope to our viewers. âWe Love Good TVâ has become our standard. It\\'s what we stand for and what we aspire to and we believe the best way to do that is through the power of story. We are intentional in broadcasting life-changing stories, that inspire, encourage, build-up and declare the Love of God to all. The greatest story of all, is a Love story, it\\'s all about Jesus.\\n\\nSection::::Content.\\nThe Australian Christian Channel sources programming from all over the world and Australia, with a goal to continue to increase the amount of quality local Aussie content on air.

Named in honor of Union General Israel B. Richardson, who died in the Battle of Antietam during the American Civil War, it was active from 1867 to 1878. Today, the site, with a few surviving buildings, is called Fort Richardson State Park, Historic Site and Lost Creek Reservoir State Trailway. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963 for its role in securing the state\\'s northern frontier in the post-Civil War era.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nAs much as any frontier army installation, Fort Richardson facilitated white immigration and settlement in north-central Texas. It was part of a system of forts along the Texas frontier to protect and encourage settlement in north-central and West Texas. Others included Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. Some \"subposts or intermediate stations\" include Bothwick\\'s Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.\\n\\nThe original site selection was ordered for a location near Buffalo Springs in Clay County about north of Fort Richardson. The location proved untenable and unfit for a semi-permanent installation. The area lacked timber and adequate water resources, and the U.S. considered it \"hostile\" territory, with Native Americans often raiding the area. In 1862, an entire town, Henrietta, northwest of Buffalo Springs, was abandoned due to lack of security. As a result, the U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment moved south to the present location of Fort Richardson.\\n\\nIn 1867, construction began by the 6th Cavalry on the site along \"Lost Creek, a small tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River\", at a cost of $800,000, and occupied on 26 November. It became the anchor of the frontier fort system, and the last army outpost in north Texas along the military road to Fort Sill. \"Originally a five-company post, it was expanded...to accommodate ten or more companies\" so that in 1872, with a population of 666 officers and men, it was listed as the largest U.S. Army installation in the United States. The old-time cowboy author Frank H. Maynard spent time at Fort Richardson in 1872 while he had come to Jacksboro on a cattle drive.\\n\\nUnits that occupied the fort included the 6th Cavalry Regiment, the 4th Cavalry Regiment, and the U.S. 11th Infantry Regiment, along with parts of the 10th Cavalry Regiment and 24th Infantry Regiment (United States), both Buffalo Soldier regiments.\\n\\nLife was hard for a soldier at Fort Richardson. Routine duties included long, arduous patrols along the frontier from Clay and Jack Counties west to Palo Duro Canyon near present-day Amarillo. Battles with Comanche and Kiowa Indians became commonplace as the U.S. cavalry and infantry units sought to prove their ability to repel attacks and facilitate white settlement.\\n\\nIn 1871 while touring the system, General William T. Sherman stayed at Fort Richardson and narrowly missed the Warren Wagon Train Raid. General Sherman arrived at Fort Sill and arrested Kiowa chiefs Satanta and Big Tree and had them sent to Jacksboro to stand trial for their role in the massacre. In July 1871, they were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, which was later commuted to life in prison. They were the first Indians tried and convicted in a Texas civil court system.\\n\\nFollowing these events, General Sherman authorized the commander of the 4th Cavalry, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, to begin offensive operations against the Comanche and Kiowa in the Texas Panhandle. One scouting party fought in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon in September 1874, a U.S. victory that ended the Red River War with Quanah Parker\\'s Comanches and Red Warbonnet\\'s Kiowas. The cavalry captured so much of the tribes\\' provisions that they were forced to move back to reservations in Oklahoma before winter. This battle was largely responsible for the end to Comanche and Kiowa raids along the northern frontier between Oklahoma and Texas.\\n\\nSection::::Abandonment and Reuse.\\nAfter its victory, the army saw no need to maintain Fort Richardson and abandoned the post on May 23, 1878. \"It was used as an Indian school for a short time afterwards\". The 55 buildings, many made of stone and cottonwood lumber, fell into disrepair. Thanks to a group of Jacksboro residents, the fort was declared a state historic site in 1963 and came under the management of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In 1968, extensive renovations began, and in 1973, it reopened as \"Fort Richardson State Historic Park.\"\\n\\nToday it is called Fort Richardson State Park, Historic Site and Lost Creek Reservoir State Trailway. Visitors can tour seven restored original buildings, including the post hospital, officers\\' quarters, powder magazine, morgue, commissary, guardhouse, and bakery. Two replica buildings of the enlisted men\\'s barracks and the officer\\'s barracks house the Interpretive Center.

With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and dark sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour\".\\n\\nHer father, Charles Wintour, editor of the London \"Evening Standard\" (1959â76), consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the US, with stints at \"New York\" and \"House & Garden\". She returned to London and was the editor of British \"Vogue\" between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise\\'s magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.\\n\\nA former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the 2003 bestselling \"roman Ã  clef\" \"The Devil Wears Prada\", later made into a successful film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor, believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009, she was the focus of another film, R. J. Cutler\\'s documentary \"The September Issue\".\\n\\nSection::::Family.\\nWintour was born in Hampstead, London in 1949, to Charles Wintour (1917â1999), editor of the \"Evening Standard\", and Eleanor \"Nonie\" Trego Baker (1917â1995), an American, the daughter of a Harvard law professor. Her parents married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna Baker (nÃ©e Gilkyson), a merchant\\'s daughter from Pennsylvania. Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded publications such as \"Honey\" and \"Petticoat\", is her stepmother.\\n\\nThe late-18th-century novelist Lady Elizabeth Foster, Duchess of Devonshire, was Wintour\\'s great-great-great-grandmother, and Sir Augustus Vere Foster, the last Baronet of that name, was a granduncle.\\n\\nShe had four siblings. Her older brother, Gerald, died in a traffic accident as a child. One of her younger brothers, Patrick, is also a journalist, currently diplomatic editor of \"The Guardian\". James and Nora Wintour have worked in London local government and for international non-governmental organisations, respectively.\\n\\nShe lives in Greenwich Village.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nIn her youth, Wintour was educated at the independent North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against the dress code by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing her hair in a bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on \"Ready Steady Go!,\" and from the issues of \"Seventeen\" which her grandmother sent from the United States. \"Growing up in London in the \\'60s, you\\'d have to have had Irving Penn\\'s sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion,\" she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.\\n\\nAt the age of 15, she began dating well-connected older men. She was involved briefly with Piers Paul Read, then 24. In her later teens, she and gossip columnist Nigel Dempster became a fixture on the London club circuit.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSection::::From fashion to journalism.\\n\"I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion,\" she recalled in \"The September Issue\". He arranged for his daughter\\'s first job, at the influential Biba boutique, when she was 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents\\' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, \"You either know fashion or you don\\'t.\" Another older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her her first experience of magazine production at his popular and controversial \"Oz\".\\n\\nIn 1970, when \"Harper\\'s Bazaar UK\" merged with \"Queen\" to become \"Harper\\'s & Queen\", Wintour was hired as one of its first editorial assistants, beginning her career in fashion journalism. She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit \"Vogue\". While there, she discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate. Her connections helped her secure locations for innovative shoots by Helmut Newton, Jim Lee and other trend-setting photographers. One recreated the works of Renoir and Manet using models in go-go boots. After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.\\n\\nSection::::New York City.\\nIn her new home, she became a junior fashion editor at \"Harper\\'s Bazaar\" in New York City in 1975. Wintour\\'s innovative shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months. She was reportedly introduced to Bob Marley by one of Bradshaw\\'s friends, and disappeared with him for a week; in a 2017 appearance on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\", she said she had never actually met the reggae legend, but certainly would have \"hooked up\" with him if she had. A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a fashion editor, at \"Viva\", a women\\'s adult magazine started by Kathy Keeton, then wife of \"Penthouse\" publisher Bob Guccione. She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection. This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.\\n\\nIn late 1978, Guccione shut down the unprofitable magazine. Wintour decided to take some time off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women\\'s magazine named \"Savvy\". It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money, the readers Wintour would later target at \"Vogue\".\\n\\nThe following year, she became fashion editor of \"New York.\" There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving Rachel Ward how effectively celebrity covers sold copies. \"Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did,\" Grace Coddington said three decades later. A former colleague arranged for an interview with \"Vogue\" editor Grace Mirabella that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.\\n\\nSection::::CondÃ© Nast.\\nShe went to work at \"Vogue\" later when Alex Liberman, editorial director for CondÃ© Nast, publisher of \"Vogue\", talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine\\'s first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities. Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella\\'s knowledge, causing friction among the staff. She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London. They married in 1984.\\n\\nIn 1985, Wintour attained her first editorship, taking over the UK edition of \"Vogue\" after Beatrix Miller retired. Once in charge, she replaced many of the staff and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour\" in the process. Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as \"The Wintour of Our Discontent.\" Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour\\'s ideal reader was the same woman \"Savvy\" had tried to reach. \"There\\'s a new kind of woman out there,\" she told the \"Evening Standard.\" \"She\\'s interested in business and money. She doesn\\'t have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.\"\\n\\nIn 1987, Wintour returned to New York to take over \"House & Garden.\" Its circulation had long lagged behind rival \"Architectural Digest,\" and CondÃ© Nast hoped she could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2\\xa0million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week. She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as \"House & Garment\", and enough celebrities that it was referred to as \"Vanity Chair\", within the industry.\\n\\nThose changes worsened the magazine\\'s problems. When the title was shortened to just \"HG\", many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine\\'s traditional advertisers pulled out.\\n\\nTen months later, she became editor of US \"Vogue\". Under Mirabella, it had become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion. Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of \"Elle\". After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour\\'s covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a \"Vogue\" cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn\\'t fit).\\n\\nIn 2012, Wintour reflected on the cover:\\n\\nYears later, Wintour admitted the photo had never been planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when \"Vogue\" put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, \"I just said, \\'Well, let\\'s just try this.\\' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, \\'This is something new. This is something different.\\' The printers called to make sure that was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made.\" In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. \"[I]t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for \"Vogue\".\"\\n\\n\"Wintour\\'s approach hit a nerveâthis was the way real women put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts),\" one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour\\'s first cover.\\n\\nSection::::1990s.\\nUnder her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland. \"Vogue\" held its position as market leader against three contenders: \"Elle\"; \"Harper\\'s Bazaar\", which had lured away Liz Tilberis, Wintour\\'s most prominent deputy, and \"Mirabella\", a magazine Rupert Murdoch created for Wintour\\'s fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: Tina Brown, editor of \"Vanity Fair\" and later \"The New Yorker\".\\n\\nAt the end of the decade, another of Wintour\\'s inner circle left to run \"Harper\\'s Bazaar\". Kate Betts, seen as Wintour\\'s likely successor, had broadened the magazine\\'s reach by commissioning stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture, and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the \"Index\" section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine. At staff meetings, she earned Wintour\\'s respect as the only person who publicly challenged her.\\n\\nThe two began to disagree about the magazine\\'s direction. Betts felt \"Vogue\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s fashion coverage was getting too limited. Wintour in turn thought that the stories with popular culture angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with Plum Sykes, whom Betts reportedly detested as a \"pretentious airhead.\" Eventually, she left, complaining to \"The New York Times\" that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor\\'s letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.\\n\\nSection::::2000s.\\nBetts was one of several longtime editors to leave \"Vogue\" around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city\\'s upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn\\'t last, a new group of core editors formed.\\n\\nThe September 2004 issue was 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, since exceeded by the September 2007 issue Cutler\\'s documentary covered. Wintour oversaw the introduction of three spinoffs: \"Teen Vogue\", \"Vogue Living\" and \"Men\\'s Vogue.\" \"Teen Vogue\" has published more ad pages and earned more advertiser revenue than either \"Elle Girl\" and \"Cosmo Girl\", and the 164 ad pages in the dÃ©but issue of \"Men\\'s Vogue\" were the most for a first issue in CondÃ© Nast history. \"AdAge\" named her \"Editor of the Year\" for this brand expansion.\\n\\nQueen Elizabeth II appointed her Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.\\n\\nThat year was generally difficult, as the economy worsened. After ruffling feathers at the Milan shows in February, the April issue\\'s cover image of LeBron James and Gisele BÃ¼ndchen brought criticism for its evocation of racial stereotypes. The next month a lavish Karl Lagerfeld gown she wore to the Met\\'s Costume Institute Gala was called \"the worst fashion \"faux pas\" of 2008.\" In the fall, \"Vogue Living\" was suspended indefinitely, and \"Men\\'s Vogue\" cut back to two issues a year as an outsert or supplement to the women\\'s magazine. At the end of the year, December\\'s cover highlighted a disparaging comment Jennifer Aniston made about Angelina Jolie, to the former\\'s displeasure; media observers began speculating that Wintour had lost her touch.\\n\\nIn 2008, rumours arose that she would retire, and be replaced by French \"Vogue\" editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian \"GQ\" reportedly introduced Russian \"Vogue\" editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American \"Vogue\". CondÃ© Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in \"The New York Times\" defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn\\'t lost her touch, the magazine had become \"stale and predictable,\" as a reader had recently complained. \"To read \"Vogue\" in recent years is to wonder about the peculiar fascination for the \\'villa in Tuscany\\' story,\" Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.\\n\\nIn 2009, Wintour began making more media appearances. On a \"60 Minutes\" profile, she said she would not retire. \"To me this is a really interesting time to be in this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible not to put my best foot forward and lead us into a different time.\" In September, \"The September Issue\", a documentary film by \"The War Room\" producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.\\n\\nSection::::2010s.\\nIn 2013, CondÃ© Nast announced she would be taking on the position of artistic director for the company\\'s magazines while remaining at \"Vogue\". She assumed some of the responsibilities of Si Newhouse, the company\\'s longtime chairman, who, in his mid-80s at the time, was retreating from his role at CondÃ© Nast to oversee managing Advance Publications, its parent company. A company spokesman told \"The New York Times\" the position was created to keep Wintour. She described it as \"an extension of what I am doing, but on a broader scale.\"\\n\\nIn January 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named its Costume Institute complex after Wintour; First Lady Michelle Obama opened it in May of that year. Wintour starred in \"The Fashion Fund\", which aired on Ovation TV that year as well; she was named the 39th most powerful woman in the world by \"Forbes\".\\n\\nOn the occasion of the 10th anniversary of \"The Devil Wears Prada\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s release, in 2016, \"The Ringer\" noted how Wintour\\'s personal image had evolved since that film\\'s depiction of Miranda Priestley. \"A decade ago this summer, Wintour became a living, breathing avatar for a certain kind of bossâthe terrible kind, with \\'great\\' a halfhearted asterisk,\" wrote Alison Herman. \"\"The Devil Wears Prada\" transformed Wintour\\'s image from that of a mere public figure into that of a cultural icon.\"\\n\\nBut since then, \"Wintour isn\\'t just redeemed. She\\'s openly admired, Arctic chill and all.\" The grievances reflected in the novel and film \"[seem] like an increasingly petty complaint when held up against a readership that remains well into the seven figures and the undisputed edge in ad sales that comes with it. Wintour is seemingly the only person on earth who knows how to run a steady print operation in 2016 ... At 10 years old, Miranda Priestley is iconic but ever-so-slightly out of date. Anna Wintour is still the boss...\"\\n\\nIn a May 2017 ceremony at Buckingham Palace, Wintour was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to fashion and journalism. According to a January 2017 report in \"The Nation\", an American news magazine, it was rumored that Wintour would have become the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom had Hillary Clinton been elected President of the United States the previous November.\\n\\nSection::::Fashion industry power broker.\\nThrough the years, she has come to be regarded as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear \"Do you want me to go to Anna with this?\" when they have differences with her subordinates. \"The Guardian\" has called her the \"unofficial mayoress\" of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protÃ©gÃ©e at \"Vogue\", Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York\\'s fashionable Ã©lite.\\n\\nHer salary was reported to be $2 million a year in 2005. In addition, she receives several perks, such as a chauffeured Mercedes S-Class (both in New York and abroad), a $200,000 shopping allowance, and the Coco Chanel Suite at the Hotel Ritz Paris while attending European fashion shows. CondÃ© Nast president S.I. Newhouse had the company make her an interest-free $1.6 million loan to purchase her townhouse in Greenwich Village.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nShe had two children by David Shaffer following their 1984 marriage: Charles (Charlie) born 1985, and Katherine (known as Bee) born 1987. The latter wrote occasional columns for \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2006, but says she won\\'t follow her mother into fashion. The couple divorced in 1999. Newspapers and gossip columnists claimed her affair with investor Shelby Bryan ended the marriage. She declined to comment. Her friends say Bryan has mellowed her. \"She smiles now and has been seen to laugh,\" the \"Observer\" quoted one as saying.\\n\\nWintour is also a philanthropist. She serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where she has organised benefits that have raised $50 million for the museum\\'s Costume Institute. She began the CFDA/Vogue Fund in order to encourage, support and mentor unknown fashion designers. She has also raised over $10\\xa0million for AIDS charities since 1990, by organising various high-profile benefits.\\n\\nShe claims to rise before 6a.m., plays tennis and has her hair and makeup done, then gets to \"Vogue\"s offices two hours later. She always arrives at fashion shows well before their scheduled start. \"I use the waiting time to make phone calls and notes; I get some of my best ideas at the shows,\" she says. According to the BBC documentary series \"Boss Woman\", she rarely stays at parties for more than 20\\xa0minutes at a time and goes to bed by 10:15 every night. She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine\\'s visual content. Since her first days as editor, she has required that photographers not begin until she has approved Polaroids of the setup and clothing. Afterwards, they must submit all their work to the magazine, not just their personal choices.\\n\\nHer control over the text is less certain. Her staff claim she reads everything written for publication, but former editor Richard Story has claimed she rarely, if ever, reads any of \"Vogue\"s arts coverage or book reviews. Earlier in her career, she often left writing of the text that accompanied her layouts to others; former coworkers claim she has minimal skills in that area. Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor\\'s letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself. She often turns her mobile phone off in order to eat her lunch, usually a steak (or bunless hamburger), undisturbed. High-protein meals have been a habit of hers for a long time. \"It was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs \"every single day\"\" for lunch, says a co-worker at \"Harpers & Queen\". \"She would eat nothing else.\"\\n\\nSection::::Personal fashion preferences.\\nBecause of her position, Wintour\\'s wardrobe is often closely scrutinised and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable T-shirts and vests with designer jeans. When she started at \"Vogue\" as creative director she switched to Chanel suits with miniskirts. She continued to wear them during both pregnancies, opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping her jacket on to cover up. Wintour was listed as \"one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s\" by the \"Guardian\" in March 2013.\\n\\nAccording to biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, her ubiquitous sunglasses are actually corrective lenses, since she suffers from deteriorating vision as her father did. A former colleague he interviewed recalls trying on her Wayfarers in her absence and getting dizzy. \"I think at this point they\\'ve become, you know, really armour,\" Wintour herself told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Morley Safer, explaining that they allow her to keep her reactions to a show private. As she rebounded from the end of her marriage and the turnover in the magazine\\'s editorial staff, a fellow editor and friend noted that \"she\\'s not hiding behind her glasses anymore. Now she\\'s having fun again.\"\\n\\nSection::::Politics.\\nWintour has been a supporter of the Democratic Party since Hillary Clinton\\'s 2000 Senate run and John Kerry\\'s 2004 presidential run and serving Barack Obama\\'s 2008 and 2012 presidential runs as a \"bundler\" of contributions. In 2008 and 2012, she co-hosted fundraisers with Sarah Jessica Parker, the latter being a 50-person, $40,000-per-person dinner at Parker\\'s West Village town house with Meryl Streep, Michael Kors, and Trey Laird, an advertising executive, among the attendees. She has also teamed with Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein on fundraisers during Obama\\'s first term and Donna Karan has been amongst the attendees. In 2013 when \"Vogue\"s former director of communications stepped down, Wintour was rumoured to be looking to hire someone with a political background. Soon after, Wintour hired Hildy Kuryk, a former fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and Obama\\'s first campaign. She supported Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 Presidential Campaign, forming part of Clinton\\'s long list of wealthy donors or \"Hillblazers\" as well as serving as Clinton\\'s consultant on her wardrobe choices for key moments of the campaign.\\n\\nSection::::\"The Devil Wears Prada\".\\nLauren Weisberger, a former Wintour assistant who left \"Vogue\" for \"Departures\" along with Richard Story, wrote \"The Devil Wears Prada\" after a writing workshop he suggested she take. It was eagerly anticipated for its supposed insider portrait of Wintour prior to its publication. Wintour told \"The New York Times\", \"I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven\\'t decided whether I am going to read it or not.\" While it has been suggested that the setting and Miranda Priestly were based on \"Vogue\" and Wintour, Weisberger claims she drew not only from her own experiences but those of her friends as well. Wintour herself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the book, where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other.\\n\\nIn the novel, Miranda has many similarities to Wintourâamong them, she is British, has two children, and is described as a major contributor to the Met. Priestly is a tyrant who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.\\n\\nBetts, who had been fired by Harper\\'s after two years during which staffers said she tried too hard to emulate Wintour, reviewed it harshly in \"The New York Times Book Review\":\\nPriestly has some positive qualities. Andrea Sachs, the novel\\'s main character, notes that she makes all the magazine\\'s key editorial decisions by herself and that she has genuine class and style. \"I never for one second didn\\'t know it was an amazing opportunity to assist Anna,\" Weisberger said in 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Film adaptation.\\nThe film version of the novel has not been the only movie to have a character borrowing some aspects of Wintour. Edna Mode\\'s similar hairstyle in \"The Incredibles\" has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" on Wintour. Fey Sommers in the \"Ugly Betty\" television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour\\'s last name homophonous with \\'Winter\\', while Sommers\\' is homophonous with \\'Summer\\'.\\n\\nDuring the film\\'s production in 2005, Wintour was reportedly threatening prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, that \"Vogue\" would not cover them if they made cameo appearances in the movie as themselves. She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that \"supports fashion.\" Many designers are mentioned in the film. Only one, Valentino Garavani, appeared as himself.\\n\\nThe film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success. Wintour attended the premiÃ¨re wearing Prada. In the film, actress Meryl Streep plays a Priestly different enough from the book\\'s to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character. (Streep\\'s office in the film was similar enough to Wintour\\'s that Wintour reportedly had hers redecorated.)\\n\\nWintour reportedly said the film would probably go straight to DVD. It made over $300\\xa0million in worldwide box office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with Barbara Walters that aired the day of the DVD\\'s release, Wintour said she found the film \"really entertaining\" and praised it for making fashion \"entertaining and glamorous and interesting ... I was 100 percent behind it.\"\\n\\nThat opinion of the movie has not yet led her to forgive Weisberger. When it was reported that the novelist\\'s editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour\\'s spokesman suggested she \"should get a job as someone else\\'s assistant.\"\\n\\nOppenheimer suggests \"The Devil Wears Prada\" may have done Wintour a favour by increasing her name recognition. \"Besides giving Weisberger her fifteen minutes,\" he says, \"[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon. [She] was now known and talked about over Big Macs and french fries under the Golden Arches by young fashionistas in Wal-Mart denim in Davenport and Dubuque.\"\\n\\nWhen \"The September Issue\" was released three years later, critics compared it with the earlier, fictional film. \"For the past year or so, she\\'s been on the media warpath to win back her image,\" said Paul Schrodt in \"Slant Magazine\". Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep\\'s Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. Manohla Dargis at \"The New York Times\" said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and \"the documentary continues this.\" \"The movie offers insights that lift it beyond a realist version of \"The Devil Wears Prada,\"\" agreed Mary Pols in \"Time\".\\n\\nSection::::Criticism.\\nIn 2005, two years after \"The Devil Wears Prada\", Oppenheimer\\'s \"Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue\\'s Editor in Chief\" was published. It painted a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but discouraged others from talking to him.\\n\\nSection::::Personality.\\nWintour is often described as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. \"At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became \\'Anna Wintour,\\' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public,\" wrote \"The Guardian\". \"I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I\\'m sure it\\'s intentional,\" Coddington says. \"I don\\'t find her to be accessible to people she doesn\\'t need to be accessible to,\" agrees \"Vogue\" publisher Tom Florio.\\n\\nShe has said she admired her father Charles, known as \"Chilly Charlie\" for being \"inscrutable.\" Former coworkers told Oppenheimer of a similar aloofness on her part. But she is also known for volatile outbursts of displeasure, and the widely used \"Nuclear Wintour\" sobriquet is a result of both. She dislikes it enough to have asked \"The New York Times\" not to use it. \"There are times I get quite angry,\" she admitted in \"The September Issue\".\\n\\n\"I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up â very terse,\" a friend told the \"Observer\". \"She doesn\\'t do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her assistant.\" A former assistant said, \"You definitely did not ride the elevator with her.\" Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the \"Vogue\" offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour\\'s assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she \"did \"absolutely\" the right thing.\"\\n\\nEven friends admit to some trepidation in her presence. \"Anna happens to be a friend of mine,\" says Barbara Amiel, \"a fact which is of absolutely no help in coping with the cold panic that grips me whenever we meet.\" \"I know when to stop pushing her,\" says Coddington. \"She doesn\\'t know when to stop pushing me.\"\\n\\nShe has often been described as a perfectionist who routinely makes impossible, arbitrary demands of subordinates: \"kitchen scissors at work,\" in the words of one commentator. She once made a junior staffer look through a photographer\\'s trash to find a picture he had refused to give her. In a deleted scene from \"The September Issue\", she complains about the \"horrible white plastic buckets\" of ice behind the bars at the CFDA\\'s 7th on Sale AIDS benefit and moves them out of sight. \"The notion that Anna would want something done \\'now\\' and not \\'shortly\\' is accurate,\" Amiel says of \"The Devil Wears Prada\". \"Anna wants what she wants right away.\" A longtime assistant says, \"She throws you in the water and you\\'ll either sink or swim.\"\\n\\nPeter Braunstein, the former \"Women\\'s Wear Daily\" (WWD) media reporter, later convicted of sexually assaulting a coworker, allegedly planned to kill Wintour because of perceived slights. After receiving only one ticket to the 2002 \"Vogue\" Fashion Awards, which he perceived as a snub, he became so angry that \"WWD\" fired him. At his 2007 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence a journal he kept on his computer in which he stated his intention to kill her. In it he wrote, \"She just never talked to peons like us\" to justify his intended actions.\\n\\nOn one occasion, she has had to pay for her treatment of employees. In 2004, a court ruled that she and Shaffer were to pay $104,403, and Wintour herself an additional $32,639, to settle a lawsuit brought against them by the New York State Workers\\' Compensation Board. They had failed to pay the $140,000 judgement it incurred on behalf of a former employee injured on the job, who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.\\n\\nIn the 2000s, her relationship with Bryan was credited with softening her personality at work. \"Even when she\\'s in a bad mood, she has a different posture,\" someone described as a \"Wintour watcher\" told the \"New York Observer\". \"The consensus is that she\\'s so much more mellow and easier to work for ...\"\\n\\nSection::::Pro-fur stance.\\nShe has often been the target of animal rights organisations like PETA, who are angered by her use of fur in \"Vogue\", her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organisations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there\\'s always a way to wear it. \"Nobody was wearing fur until she put it on the cover in the early 1990s,\" says Vogue co-worker Tom Florio. \"She ignited the entire industry.\"\\n\\nShe has \"lost count\" of the times she has been physically attacked by activists. In Paris in October 2005, she was hit with a tofu pie while waiting to get into the ChloÃ© show. On another occasion, an activist dumped a dead raccoon on her plate at a restaurant; she told the waiter to remove it. She and \"Vogue\" publisher Ron Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the CondÃ© Nast offices during the company\\'s annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.\\n\\nOthers outside of the animal-rights community have raised the fur issue. Fashion journalist Peter Braunstein wrote in his manifesto that she would go to a hell guarded by large rats, where it would be so warm she wouldn\\'t need to wear fur. Pamela Anderson, in an early 2008 interview, said Wintour was the living person she most despised \"because she bullies young designers and models to use and wear fur.\"\\n\\nSection::::Elitism.\\nAnother common criticism of Wintour\\'s editorship focuses on \"Vogue\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s increasing use of celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a \"Vogue\"-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von FÃ¼rstenberg. \"I don\\'t think Vreeland had that kind of concentration,\" says \"WWD\" publisher Patrick McCarthy. \"She wouldn\\'t have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her.\" By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in \"Vogue\" but more general-interest magazines like \"People\" and \"Us\", which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. \"The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor,\" says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn\\'t selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for \"Vogue\". All complied.\\n\\nAnother \"Vogue\" writer has complained Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. \"She\\'s obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader,\" she says. \"We once had a piece about breast cancer which started with an airline stewardess, but she wouldn\\'t have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who\\'d had cancer.\"\\n\\nWintour has been accused of setting herself apart even from peers. \"I do not think fiction could surpass the reality,\" a British fashion magazine editor says of \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" \"[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life.\" Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. \"We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag.\"\\n\\nAt Milan Fashion Week in 2008, she requested that some key shows be rescheduled for earlier in the week so she and other U.S.-based editors could have time to return home before the Paris shows. This led to complaints. Other editors said they had to rush through the earlier shows, and lesser-known designers who had to show later were denied an important audience. Dolce & Gabbana said Italian fashion was getting short shrift and Milan was becoming a \"circus without sense.\"\\n\\nGiorgio Armani, who at the time was co-chairing a Met exhibition on superheroes\\' costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his personal remarks. \"Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn\\'t think was a beautiful dress,\" he said. While he claimed he couldn\\'t understand why people disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope she hadn\\'t made a comment once attributed to her \"the Armani era is over.\" He accused her of preferring French and American fashion over Italian. Geoffrey Beene, who stopped inviting Wintour to shows after she stopped writing about him, called her \"a boss lady in four-wheel drive who ignores or abandons those who do not fuel her tank. As an editor, she has turned class into mass, taste into waste.\"\\n\\nHer remarks about obesity have caused controversy on more than one occasion. In 2005, Wintour was heavily criticised by the New York chapter of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance after \"Vogue\" editor-at-large AndrÃ© Leon Talley said on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", at one point, Wintour demanded he lose weight. \"Most of the \"Vogue\" girls are so thin, tremendously thin\" he said, \"because Miss Anna doesn\\'t like fat people.\" In 2009, residents of Minneapolis took umbrage after she told \"60 Minutes\" she could \"only kindly describe most of the people I saw as little houses.\" They noted their city had been named the third fittest in the nation that year by \"Men\\'s Fitness\" while New York had been named the fifth fattest.\\n\\nWintour surprised observers when developing an association with the Kardashian family and Kanye West, which culminated in having the Kardashian-Wests on a \"Vogue cover\"; Wintour reportedly commented that having only \"deeply tasteful\" people in the magazine was boring, and her decision to resort to such personalities has led some to accuse the magazine of being \"desperate for buzz.\" Wintour has nevertheless continued the association with the less-than-\"deeply tasteful\" pair.\\n\\nSection::::Responses.\\nDefences of Wintour have often come from others. Amanda Fortini at \"Slate\" said she was comfortable with Wintour\\'s elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion:\\n\\nEmma Brockes sees this in Wintour herself: \"[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible.\"\\n\"Print publications have to be as luxurious an experience as possible,\" Wintour explained in 2015. \"You have to feel it coming off the page. You have to see photographs and pieces that you couldn\\'t possibly see anywhere else.\"\\n\\nSome friends see her purported coldness as just traditional British reserve, or shyness. Brockes says it may be mutual, \"partly a reflection of how awkward people are with her, particularly women, who get preemptively chippy when faced with the prospect of meeting Fashion Incarnate.\" Wintour describes herself as shy, and Harry Connick Jr., who escorted her and Bee to shows in 2007, agrees. When Morley Safer asked her about complaints about her personality, she said,\\n\\nShe has made similar statements in defence of her reported refusal to hire fat people. \"It\\'s important to me that the people that are working here, particularly in the fashion department,\" she says, \"will present themselves in a way that makes sense to the outside world that they work at \"Vogue.\"\"\\n\\nHer defenders have called criticism sexist. \"Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts,\" said \"The New York Times\" in a piece about Wintour shortly after \"The Devil Wears Prada\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s release. When she took over at \"Vogue\", gossip columnist Liz Smith reported rumours she had gotten the job through an affair with Si Newhouse. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings. She still complained about it when accepting a media award in 2002.\\n\\nShe has been called a feminist whose changes to \"Vogue\" have reflected, acknowledged, and reinforced advances in the status of women. Reviewing Oppenheimer\\'s book in the \"Washington Monthly\", managing editor Christina Larson notes that \"Vogue\", unlike many other women\\'s magazines,\\nWintour, unlike Vreeland, \"...shifted \"Vogue\"s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty.\" To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means women are making the cover of \"Vogue\" at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look.\\n\\nComplaints about her role as fashion \"eminence grise\" are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. \"She\\'s honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no,\" according to Karl Lagerfeld. \"She\\'s not too pushy\", agrees FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chief executive officer of PPR, Gucci\\'s parent company. \"She lets you know it\\'s not a problem if you can\\'t do something she wants.\" Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or \"Vogue\". Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep \"Vogue\" independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine\\'s editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. \"Commercial is not a dirty word to me.\"\\n\\nWintour herself, when asked about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power attributed to her. \"I don\\'t think of myself as a powerful person,\" she told \"Forbes\" in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world\\'s hundred most powerful women. \"You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I\\'m extremely grateful.\"\\n\\nIn response to criticisms like Beene\\'s, she has defended the democratisation of what were once exclusive luxury brands. \"It means more people are going to get better fashion,\" she told Dana Thomas. \"And the more people who can have fashion, the better.\"\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Anna Wintour', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730578'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'wgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7305907', 'text': \"Ribault Inn Club\\n\\nThe Ribault Club is an historic building on Fort George Island near Jacksonville, Florida.

The book was published originally as in 1981, and became an \"instant bestseller\" in Japan. The book is about the values of the unconventional education that Kuroyanagi received at Tomoe Gakuen, a Tokyo elementary school founded by educator Sosaku Kobayashi during World War II.\\n\\nThe Japanese name of the book is an expression used to describe people who have failed.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nAfter hearing about how children were refusing to attend school, Tetsuko decided to write about her experience attending Tomoe Gakuen. \"Totto-chan\" was originally published in Japan as a series of articles in Kodansha\\'s \"Young Woman\" magazine appearing from February 1979 through December 1980. The articles were then collected into a book, which made Japanese publishing history by selling more than 5 million before the end of 1982, which made the book break all previous publishing records and become the bestselling book in Japanese history.\\n\\nAn English edition, translated by Dorothy Britton, was published in America in 1984. The book has been translated into a number of languages, including, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, French, Italian, German, Korean, Malay, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Russian, Uyghur, Sinhala, and Lao, and many Indian languages including Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu, Assamese, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali and Oriya.\\n\\nA bilingual collection of stories from the book, entitled \"Best of Totto-chan: Totto Chan: The Little Girl at the Window\", was published in 1996.\\n\\nSection::::Plot synopsis.\\nThe book begins with Totto-chan\\'s mother coming to know of her daughter\\'s expulsion from public school. Her mother realizes that Totto-chan needs a school where more freedom of expression is permitted. Thus, she takes Totto-chan to meet the headmaster of the new school, Mr. Kobayashi, where the two establish a friendly teacher-student relationship.\\n\\nThe book describes the friends Totto-chan makes, the lessons she learns, and the vibrant atmosphere she enjoys at Tomoe Gakuen. Mr. Kobayashi introduces new activities to interest the pupils. Mr. Kobayashi understands children and strives to develop their minds and bodies. He is concerned for the physically handicapped and his emphasizes how all children are remarkable. \"Totto-chan\" makes best friends with a Christian boy who has polio. Another classmate was raised in America for all his life and cannot speak Japanese, and the headmaster tells the children to learn English from him, despite governmental restraints against using the \"enemy\\'s\" language. The epilogue explains how Headmaster Kobayashi had good connections with leaders in government.\\n\\nBut in this the school, the children lead happy lives, unaware of the things going on in the world. World War II has started, yet in this school, no signs of it are seen. There are hints of something awry when \"Totto-chan\" cannot buy caramel candies from the vending machine on her way to school, and it becomes harder for her mother to meet the requirements for a balanced lunch. In another scene, there is a boy who is bawling his eyes out at being removed from the school by his parents, with Headmaster Kobayashi helplessly letting the student vent with tears forming in his own eyes.\\n\\nOne day, the school is bombed, and is never rebuilt, even though the headmaster claims that he looked forward to building an even better school the next time round. This ends Totto-chan\\'s years as a pupil at Tomoe Gakuen.\\n\\nSection::::Use in classrooms.\\nStarting in 1983, it was used as a textbook for third-year Japanese elementary students, and at least one American school used material from it in 1993.\\n\\nSection::::Related works.\\nKuroyanagi founded the Totto-chan Foundation, which professionally trains deaf actors to bring live theater to the deaf community.\\n\\nIn 1999, Kuroyanagi published her book \"Totto-Chan\\'s Children: A Goodwill Journey to the Children of the World\", about her travels around the world on her humanitarian mission as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.\\n\\nAn orchestral interpretation of the work was written by Japanese composer Akihiro Komori, which was released as a record.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730649'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '73121', 'text': 'Blackmore\\'s Night\\n\\nBlackmore\\'s Night is a British/American traditional folk rock band formed in 1997, consisting mainly of Ritchie Blackmore (acoustic guitar, hurdy gurdy, mandola, mandolin, nyckelharpe and electric guitar) and Candice Night (lead vocals, lyricist and woodwinds). Lineup has seen a lot of changes over the years. To date they have released ten studio albums. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Early.\\nCandice was a Rainbow fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in Renaissance music.\\n\\nDuring the reformed Rainbow\\'s recording of the album \"Stranger in Us All\" in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a pun of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.\\n\\nSection::::1997 to 2005.\\nTheir debut album \"Shadow of the Moon\" was a musical success and featured Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on flute for the song \"Play Minstrel Play\". In subsequent albums, particularly \"Fires at Midnight\", there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, whilst maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent in a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.\\nThe group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance Festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including \\'castle tours\\' of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: \"Renaissance Night\", the Italian \"Morning Star\" and the \"Midnight\".\\n\\nThey have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game.\\n\\nSection::::2006âpresent.\\nIn 2006, Night performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween\\'s \"Light the Universe\", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album \"\", released in the same year.\\n\\nOn June 27, 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called \"Secret Voyage\", a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (âLocked Within the Crystal Ball\" is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore\\'s Night also performed a cover of a Rainbow song (âRainbow Eyesâ) and an Elvis Presley cover (\"Can\\'t Help Falling in Love\").\\n\\nA new album titled \"Autumn Sky\" was released soon afterwards. Their latest album, \"All Our Yesterdays\", was released on September 18, 2015.\\nThe band are said to be working on material for a new album with a possible 2019/2020 release date.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nOn October 5, 2008, Night and Blackmore were married after 19 years together.

While down there, Tammy suddenly disappears and Kwirk, with his Veggie Friends, now has to find her in the labyrinth and bring her home.\\n\\nSection::::Gameplay.\\nKwirk has three game modes: Going Up?, Heading Out?, and Vs. Mode, each one with its own set of rules. The object is to get from one end of the room to the staircase on the other by rotating turnstiles, moving blocks, and filling holes with blocks. \\n\\nKwirk has three skill levels: Level 1 - Easy, Level 2 - Average and Level 3 - Hard. After, one of two viewpoints may be selected: Diagonal or Bird\\'s Eye. In Diagonal view, characters and blocks have shadows and appear in crude 3D, whereas in Bird\\'s Eye view everything is 2D, viewed from the top down. The three skill levels and two viewpoints are featured in all three game modes.\\n\\nSection::::Going Up?\\nIn \"Going Up?,\" the object is to go from floor to floor by rotating turnstiles, moving blocks, and filling holes with blocks to get to the staircase on the other side. There are ten floors for each Skill Level for a total of thirty floors. Along the way at certain levels, Kwirk will receive help from his Veggie Friends, who can be taken control of by pressing the Select button. The Going Up? game mode offers a menu screen (upon a press of the A button) that allows the following;\\n\\n\\nScoring is based on the time taken to complete the stage and the number of steps taken to get to the stairs.\\n\\n\"Going Up?\" serves as the story in which Kwirk has to rescue Tammy from the maze. Although the game features no storyline to progress the game, each stage ends with Tammy displaying the score, and after ten floors to each Level, Tammy and Kwirk are reunited.\\n\\nSection::::Heading Out?\\nIn \"Heading Out?\" the object is to complete a certain number of rooms consecutively to get a high score. There are a total of 99 rooms, any of which can be selected to run through by the player. Once started, the player sprints through each room solving the puzzle. Bonus Points are earned upon completion of each room. The Bonus Points start at 2000, decreasing during the course of the room, and resets after entering a new room. A timer is included to track the time through the course. After running through all the rooms the player\\'s score is then recorded on a top four list.\\n\\nSection::::Vs. Mode.\\n\"Vs. Mode\" is a race using \"Heading Out?\" mode between two players. Each player selects a number of rooms to race through, but both player do not have to select the same number of rooms as a handicap. Then a Contest is selected to decide the win condition; 1 Game playoff, or a Best of 3, 5, 7, or 9. Once started, the players can monitor each other through a Progress meter on their respective screens. The match ends when one player completes all the rooms.\\n\\nSection::::Obstacles.\\nIn each room, Kwirk must navigate around and interact with various obstacles in order to progress.\\n\\nObstacles:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Kwirkâs Veggie Friends.\\nAt certain points in the game \"Going Up?,\" one or all of Kwirkâs Veggie Friends will appear to help. They donât have special abilities, but instead play exactly like Kwirk to allow maneuvers that weren\\'t possible with only one character. The player switches between characters by pressing the select button and all of the Veggie Friends must be brought to the stairs to clear the floor.\\n\\nThe Veggie Friends:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nKwirk received largely positive reviews. Reviewers praised the games challenging difficulty. According to \"Mean Machines\", which rated the game a score of 85%, \"Kwirk\" is one of the \"simple, but very addictive\" puzzle games, as stated by Julian Rignall. Because of the number of different screens, it doesn\\'t \"become boring quickly\". Rignall stated the game gets \"incredibly hard\" and \"really taxes\" the player\\'s brain. Matt Regan criticised that once the player has solved each puzzle, there is \"no interest left\". The German magazine \"Video Games\" reviewed \"Kwirk\" in its very first issue and awarded it a \"Video Games Classic\" due to a score of 85%. The magazine\\'s editor Stephan Englhart praised the game\\'s variety of modes and puzzles. He stated that \"Kwirk\" captivates with a \"well-elaborated and harmonious overall concept\" (\"\"wohl durchdachtes und stimmiges Gesamtkonzept\"\").\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nKwirkâs only appearance outside of the Game Boy game, was on television was in the show \"Video Power\", as part of a 15-minute cartoon short called \"The Power Team\", which featured characters from Acclaim games. He usually went berserk whenever anyone calls him a \"to-MAH-to\" and not a \"to-MAY-to\".\\n\\n\"Puzzle Boy\" is one of the video games featured in the manga titled \"Rock\\'n Game Boy\", by Shigeto Ikehara and Published by Comic BomBom October 1989 to December 1991.\\n\\nOn November 16, 1990, \"Kwirk\" got a Japan-only Famicom Disk System version titled . As with the Japanese release of Puzzle Boy, \"Kwirk\" didn\\'t appear in it.\\n\\nNext, a Puzzle Boys spin-off called \"Spud\\'s Adventure\", known as , was released for the Game Boy on January 25, 1991. Unlike \"Kwirk\", in the US \"Spud\\'s Adventure\" was published by Atlus instead of Acclaim Entertainment, due to Acclaim losing their license in publishing Atlus\\'s \"Puzzle Boy\" series of games. Unlike \"Kwirk\", Atlus did not change the protagonist into a tomato, but left him as his original character of a potato, translating his name as \"Spud.\"\\n\\nNext, \"Puzzle Boys\" was ported to the PCEngine on February 22, 1991. Again, it was only released in Japan. \\n\\nThis game later got a proper sequel in the US titled \"Amazing Tater\" (known in Japan as \"Puzzle Boy II\") for the Game Boy. Like \"Spud\\'s Adventure\", the protagonist remains a potato called \"Spud.\"\\n\\nA port for the TI-89 calculator exists, written by Ludvig Strigeus..\\n\\nIn the PlayStation 2 game \"\", which was also developed by Atlus, there is a mini-game that has the same mechanics as \"Kwirk\", with some levels being lifted directly from the Game Boy game.\\n\\nIn October of 2018, the game\\'s rights were acquired by Canadian production company Liquid Media Group along with other titles originally owned by Acclaim Entertainment.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kwirk', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7315110'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'yAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7318083', 'text': 'EnjÅ\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nTold in an intricate flashback structure, \"Enjo\" dramatizes the psychological collapse of Goichi (Raizo Ichikawa), a young Buddhist acolyte from a dysfunctional family who arrives at a Kyoto temple - the Golden Pavilion - for further study.\\n\\nGoichi is haunted by two events - the discovery of his psychologically abusive mother\\'s infidelity, and the effect of the revelation upon his father, who suddenly falls ill and dies shortly thereafter.

There are also a number of candidates who sit STEP papers as a challenge. The papers are designed to test ability to answer questions similar in style to undergraduate Mathematics.\\n\\nThere are two official users of STEP Mathematics: the University of Cambridge and the University of Warwick.\\nCandidates applying to study Mathematics or Computer Science with Mathematics at the University of Cambridge are almost always required to take STEP papers as part of the terms of their conditional offer. In addition, other courses at Cambridge University with a large mathematics component, such as engineering occasionally require STEP. Candidates applying to study Mathematics or closely related subjects at the University of Warwick can take step as part of their offer.\\n\\nA typical STEP offer for a candidate applying to read Mathematics at the University of Cambridge would be at least a grade 1 in both STEP2 and STEP 3. From 2019 some colleges may (depending on the individual applicant's circumstances) require a grade 1 in either STEP 1 or 2, (or in both). Candidates applying to the University of Warwick to read Mathematics, or closely related subjects, can use a grade 1 from any STEP paper as part of their offer.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nBefore 2003, STEP papers were available for a wide range of subjects, including, for example, Chemistry and Biology, but the Mathematics STEP paper is the only one now in use. Three STEP Mathematics papers are set each year and all are sat during the school summer examination cycle.\\n\\nSection::::Format.\\nThere are three STEP papers: STEP 1, STEP 2 and STEP 3. Candidates may enter for as many as they wish, although this is often dictated by the STEP offers they hold. Each paper offers a selection of questions and there is no restriction on which can be answered. For each paper, candidates have three hours to complete their solutions. Whilst students are permitted to answer as many questions as they choose, they are advised to attempt no more than six, and their final grade is based on their six best question solutions. Each question is worth 20 marks, and so the maximum a candidate can score is 120.\\n\\nFor recent examinations, up to and including the 2018 papers, the specification for STEP 1 and STEP 2 was based on Mathematics A Level content while the syllabus for STEP 3 was based on Further Mathematics A Level. The questions on STEP 2 and 3 were about the same difficulty. Both STEP 2 and STEP 3 are harder than STEP 1.\\n\\nFor the 2019 examinations onwards, the specifications have been updated to reflect the reforms in A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics; in addition, the number of questions in each paper has been reduced. Specifically:\\n\\nSection::::Practicalities.\\nSince June 2009, graph paper has not been allowed in STEP examinations as the test requires only sketches, not detailed graphs. Instead, all graphs should be sketched inside the answer booklets provided as part of a candidate's solution. <br>\\n\\nSince June 2018, the format of the answer booklet for the STEP Mathematics examinations has been updated to ensure that the paper is fully anonymised before it is marked. Candidates are issued with a 44-page booklet, of which 40 pages are available for writing out solutions and for rough work. Only one booklet per candidate is allowed unless a further booklet is required and has been formally requested as a result of specific access arrangements.\\n\\nCandidates are advised to write their answers in black ink and draw pictures in pencil, although some flexibility is permitted with this. Candidates should not use green or red pen at any stage. \\n\\nCalculators may not be used during STEP. Rulers, protractors and compasses can be taken into the examination. Candidates who donât have English as a first language are allowed to use bilingual dictionaries.\\n\\nA formulae booklet was available to all candidates for all examinations up to and including those in 2018. From 2019 onwards, candidates will no longer be issued with a formulae booklet; instead they will be expected to recall, or know how to derive quickly, standard formulae. All the required standard formulae are given in an appendix to the new specification.\\n\\nSection::::Marking.\\nSTEP is marked by teams of mathematicians specially trained for the purpose. All the markers have Mathematics degrees and most are reading for PhDs at Cambridge. Each question is marked by a small team who coordinate to ensure their question is marked fairly and that all correct solutions are given appropriate marks. Markers are closely supervised by a team of marking supervisors, usually senior teachers, who are responsible for the mark scheme and by a senior Mathematics assessment expert.\\nAll non-crossed-out work is assessed and a candidate's final score is based on their six highest scoring solutions. \\nAll papers are checked at least twice to ensure that all of a candidate's non-crossed-out solutions have been assessed. A candidate's marks are then independently entered twice into a database to ensure that there are no clerical errors in mark recording. The mark data is then checked a further time by a small team who hand check a random selection of scripts.\\n\\nSection::::Scoring.\\nThere are five possible grades awarded. From best to worst, these are âSâ (Outstanding), â1â, â2â, â3â, and âUâ (Unclassified). The rule of thumb is that four good answers (to a reasonable level of completion) will gain a grade 1; more may gain an S, and fewer will gain a correspondingly lower grade. The grade boundaries shift from year to year, and the boundaries for STEP 3 are generally a small but appreciable margin lower than those for STEP 2.<br>\\n\\nAll STEP questions are marked out of 20. The mark scheme for each question is designed to reward candidates who make good progress towards a solution. A candidate reaching the correct answer will receive full marks, regardless of the method used to answer the question.<br>\\nAll the questions that are attempted by a student and not crossed out will be assessed. However, only the six best answers will be used in the calculation of the final grade for the paper.\\n\\nSection::::Timing and results.\\nCandidates who have received offers for Mathematics courses at the University of Cambridge sit STEP as a post-interview test. STEP papers are normally sat at a candidate's school or college. Alternatively, the test can be taken at one of Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing's authorised test centres worldwide.\\n\\nEntries for STEP papers are typically accepted from the start of March until the end of April and late entries (with late entry fees) accepted until mid-May. STEP papers are taken mid to late June, with online results available mid-August, issued on the same date as A Level results.\\n\\nSection::::Usage.\\nThere is some variation in how institutions make use of the results â candidates can contact the relevant institution(s) for more information. However, STEP papers are typically taken post-interview and the results used to supplement candidatesâ exam results. For applicants to the University of Cambridge, candidatesâ scripts are made available to admissions officers. This enables officers to make judgements on the basis of candidatesâ actual work, rather than on just their marks or grade.\\n\\nSection::::Preparation.\\nSTEP papers do not require a lot of extra knowledge as they are designed to test skills and knowledge of topics within the A Level syllabus. \\n\\nPractice materials, including past papers, example solutions and a STEP formula booklet, are available for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing website.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Sixth Term Examination Paper', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732577'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'zgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7329238', 'text': 'US Stade Tamponnaise\\n\\nUnion Sportive Stade Tamponnaise is a football club from Le Tampon, RÃ©union Island, founded in 1982 as the result of the merger between S/S Tamponnaise (founded in 1922) and Stade Tamponnais (founded in 1971).\\n\\nSection::::Stadium.\\nThe club plays its home matches at Stade KlÃ©bert Picard, which has a maximum capacity of 4,000 people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'US Stade Tamponnaise', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7329238'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'zwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7334691', 'text': 'Orangeville Northmen Jr. B\\n\\nThe Orangeville Northmen are Junior \"B\" box lacrosse team from Orangeville, Ontario, Canada.

After finishing school, he studied at the Lette Foundation, a technical college for photography in Berlin. At age 18 he started working as an independent photographer. After two years he was hired by an advertising agency as an assistant photographer and became their head of the photo department a year later. Since the age of 15, Jeglitza was involved in the upcoming hip hop Movement in Germany.\\n\\nSection::::Music career.\\nSection::::1984â88.\\nIn 1984, Jeglitza started working with the Berlin-based DJ Frank Hassas (a.k.a. Quickmix) and later started collaborating with the German producer / musician Micky Wolf. During that time, he met the rapper Aram Mouchegh (The-A) and they became a trio act called \"The Masterplan.\" In 1987, they released their first single \"We wanna be stars\", on the Select record label. The single became a commercial failure. Jeglitza later started to produce the monthly Radio Show called \"Freshline Radio\" and published a German Hip Hop magazine, titled Fresh Beat Magazine.\\n\\nIn 1988, Jeglitza and Hassas together with producer Juergen Wind formed a new project called, The Alliance. The first single release \"Action!\" was released on their own label Freshline Records. The label sold approximately 20,000 units with the help of their distribution partner 99 Records. This first 12\" was followed by more releases, leading them to a first label deal with Rough Trade Records. While \"Action!\" and the second release \"Come into my life â Rap Version\" (The Admirers) ended up being re-released by ZYX Records, the first album of The Alliance (\"Itâs time â¦\") and a couple of other products were released by Rough Trade.\\n\\nSection::::1988â95.\\n1988 saw the birth of the group M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy, in connection with a production request by Reinhard Piel (Head of A&R at ZYX Records) for a cover version of the Technotronic hit \"Pump up the Jam\". The following year the group signed a new label deal with ZYX Records and made further releases by M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy, for example the song \"Itâs on You\". They also created a number of other productions, some projects and remixes. Around 1992, the label had financial problems and O-Jay started to work part-time as a photographer again.\\n\\nIn 1993, M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy signed a new deal with the German BMG / Hansa label. The first single âAnother Nightâ was only a minor hit in Europe, barely making it into the Top 100 in several European countries. With the help of Vincent DeGiorgio, the song reached number one in Canada and the act was signed to Arista Records in the U.S. thanks to Arista Records CEO Clive Davis..\\n\\nWith the upcoming release of \"Another Night\" in the U.S., the decision was made to change the name M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy, simply into Real McCoy. The single \"Another Night\" reached number three on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles chart, where it had a 40-week run inside the Top 40. The single was certified Platinum (1,000,000 copies sold), and became the best-selling single by a German artist in the American market. \"Run Away,\" the follow-up single, entered the Top 40 of the Hot 100 Singles chart on 11 March 1995, eventually also reaching number three, and being certified Gold (500,000 copies sold) in the US and over 1,500,000 copies sold around the world. The album \"Another Night\" was released by Arista in the U.S. on 28 March 1995, and the group won several awards around the world. However, despite what some sources mention, there was no Grammy nomination involved.\\n\\nSection::::1999âpresent.\\nIn 1999, after the unexpected death of his father, Jeglitza focused on the production of other artists.

It used to be written with the characters æ´ç´ (lit. \"foreign zither\"), but over time the first character changed to æ (also pronounced \"yÃ¡ng\"), which means \"acclaimed\". It is also spelled yang quin or yang ch\\'in. Hammered dulcimers of various types are now very popular not only in China, but also Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The instruments are also sometimes known by the names \"santur\" and \"cymbalom\". This instrument had an influence on the Thai classical instrument, known as Khim (à¸à¸´à¸¡). \\n\\nThe yangqin was traditionally fitted with bronze strings (though older Chinese stringed instruments used silk strings, resulting in their, and the yangqin\\'s, categorisation as a silk, or \"si\" instrument), which gave the instrument a soft timbre. This form of instrument is still occasionally heard today in the \"hudie qin\" (è´è¶ç´, lit. \"butterfly zither\") played in the traditional silk and bamboo genre from the Shanghai region known as Jiangnan sizhu (æ±åçµ²ç«¹), as well as in some Cantonese music groups. The Thai and Cambodian \"khim\" are nearly identical in their construction, having been introduced to those nations by southern Chinese musicians. Since the 1950s, however, steel alloy strings (in conjunction with copper-wound steel strings for the bass notes) have been used, in order to give the instrument a brighter, and louder tone. The modern yangqin can have as many as five courses of bridges and may be arranged chromatically. Traditional instruments, with three or more courses of bridges, are also still widely in use. The instrument\\'s strings are struck with two lightweight bamboo beaters (also known as hammers) with rubber tips. A professional musician often carries several sets of beaters, each of which draws a slightly different tone from the instrument, much like the drum sticks of Western percussionists. The yangqin is used both as a solo instrument and in picture\\n\\nSection::::Origins.\\nHistorians offer several theories to explain how the instrument was introduced to China:\\n\\nThe word \"yangqin\" has historically been written in two different ways, using different Chinese characters for \"yang\". The \"yang\" in the earlier version was written with the character æ´, meaning \"foreign.\" It was later changed, in 1910, to the character \"yang\" (æ), meaning \"acclaimed\".\\n\\nSection::::Theory of introduction by land.\\nAnother theory of how the yangqin came into contact with the Chinese is through the Silk Road from Mongolia. At a glance, the Silk Route stretches almost 5,000 miles reaching from China to the Middle East, including Iran (Persia). The Iranian santur, a dulcimer, has existed since ancient times. If any dulcimer was to influence China by land, it is likely to be this instrument.\\n\\nThe technical structure of the santur is different in the way the tuning pegs are place, the bridges and the mallets. The yangqin\\'s tuning pins are set in parallel instead of a 90-degree angle down at the side. The mallets of the santur also differ from those of the yangqin - they are made of wood with finger grip, designed to let the players perform by gripping the two mallets between their fore and middle fingers. Both modern and earlier yangqin mallets did not include finger grips.\\n\\nThe bridge of the yangqin consist of long, single pieces of wood with many protruding \"stubs\" supporting the strings unlike the santur, which uses a number of small, individual chesspiece-like bridges.\\n\\nSection::::Theory of introduction by sea.\\nThe port at Canton/Guangzhou attracts traders from all over Asia: from Japan, India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The ships from this region bought back precious stones, slaves, exotic wares, fruits, spices, etc. Along with trade, businesses, ideas, philosophies and scientific knowledge were exchanged, including religion (principally Buddhism).\\n\\nDuring the 16th century, the Age of Exploration in Europe reached its climax and soon trade was established between China and Europe. Historians state that Portuguese, and later, English and Dutch ships, had brisk trade with China. Portuguese trading in Chinese waters began in the 16th century according to historians. Music historians report that the salterio, a hammered dulcimer, was played in Portugal, Spain, and Italy during this period. Historians say it is possible that the yangqin originated when the Portuguese, the English or the Dutch brought a dulcimer player to China who performed for locals.\\n\\nSection::::Construction.\\nAs the \"yangqin\" is a type of hammered dulcimer, it shares many elements of construction with other instruments in the hammered dulcimer family:\\n\\nSection::::Strings.\\nModern \"yangqin\" usually have 144 strings in total, with each pitch running in courses, with up to 5 strings per course, in order to boost the volume. The strings come in various thicknesses, and are tied at one end by screws, and at the other with tuning pegs. The pegs and screws are covered during playing by a hinged panel/board. This panel is opened up during tuning to access the tuning pegs.\\n\\nSection::::Bridges.\\nThere are usually four to five bridges on a \"yangqin\". From right to left, they are: bass bridge, \"right bridge\", tenor bridge, \"left bridge\", and the chromatic bridge. During playing, one is supposed to strike the strings on the left side of the bridges. However, the strings on the \"chromatic bridge\" are struck on the right, and strings on the \"left bridge\" can be struck on both sides of the bridge.\\n\\nSection::::Hammers.\\nThe hammers are made of flexible bamboo, and one end is half covered by rubber. Due to their unique construction, there are two ways to play: with the rubber side for a softer sound, and with the bamboo side for a crisper, more percussive sound. This technique, known as åç«¹ (fÇnzhÇ), is best utilized in the higher ranges of the yangqin. Additionally, the ends of the sticks can be used to pluck the strings, producing a sharp, clear sound. \"Glissandos\" can also be achieved in this way by running the ends of the sticks up or down the strings.\\n\\nFurthermore, some songs require the use of \"éé³ç´ç«¹\" (shuÄng yÄ«n qÃ­n zhÇ), literally \"double-note yangqin hammers\". These specially-constructed hammers have 2 striking surfaces, allowing the player to play up to 4 notes simultaneously (or even 8 notes, if the strings of the \"left bridge\" and \"tenor bridge\" are struck at a point where they intersect each other), resulting in a rich, powerful tone, which is especially pronounced in the lower registers due to the strings\\' long echoes. ææ²å¤å¥ (Lin Chong Flees In The Night), composed by é ç¥è¯ (Xiang Zu Hua), is a representative solo piece which utilizes éé³ç´ç«¹.\\n\\nWhen using éé³ç´ç«¹, the left hand holds a beater that plays intervals of a perfect fourth, while the right hand\\'s beater plays thirds. These intervals are standard over most of the yangqin\\'s range, due to the positioning of its strings.\\n\\nSection::::Cylindrical nuts.\\nOn both sides of the yangqin, aside from the tuning screws, are numerous cylindrical metal Nuts that can be moved for fine tuning the strings or to raise the strings slightly to eliminate unwanted vibrations that may occur. More modern designs also have moveable ball-shaped nuts that can be adjusted on the fly with the fingers; this provides some microtuning and additional dynamics during performances, such as\" portamentos\" and \"vibratos\" (see below: \"Manner of Performance\").\\n\\nSection::::Manner of Performance.\\nThe sticks are held, one in each hand, and hit the strings alternately. In the orchestra, the yangqin often adds to the harmony by playing chords or arpeggios. As the yangqin is softer than other Chinese instruments, it is usually positioned at the front of the orchestra, in the row just in front of the conductor. However, this is not a rule: the Singapore Chinese Orchestra positions the yangqin close to the percussion section. As the yangqin\\'s tones sustain long after they have been played, such an arrangement minimizies the dissonance that results. If the hands are free (e.g. in periods of rest), covering the strings with the hands quickly dampens the vibrations. The yangqin has been called the \"Chinese piano\" as it has an indispensable role in the accompaniment of Chinese string and wind instruments.\\n\\nThe yangqin\\'s solo repertoire calls for more techniques than is usually required in orchestral pieces. Examples include pressing down on the strings to produce \"vibrato\" effects, similar to that of a guzheng, as well as harmonics and é¡«ç«¹ (chÃ n zhÇ), which involves flicking the sticks lightly over the strings, causing them to vibrate, which results in a short, quick \"tremolo.\" Numerous other techniques, such as \"portamento\" - a glide from one note to another (accomplished through 2 methods, both involving the lengthening or shortening of strings: the first is by sliding the fine-tuning devices on the sides of the instrument by hand, and the second is by wearing a metallic \"ring\" - known as a æ»é³æå¥ [huÃ¡ yÄ«n zhÇ tÃ o] - and sliding it along the length of the indicated string) - are also used.\\n\\nSection::::Arrangement of pitches.\\nThe \"yangqin\" is a chromatic instrument with a range of slightly over four octaves. Middle C is located on the tenor bridge, third course from the bottom.\\n\\nThe pitches are arranged so that in general, moving one section away from the player\\'s body corresponds to a transposition of a whole tone upwards. Similarly, moving one section towards the left of the performer generally corresponds to a transposition of a perfect fifth upwards. These are only rules of thumb since the arrangement has to be modified towards the extremes of the pitch range to fill out notes in the chromatic scale. Such an arrangement facilitates transposition.\\n\\nIn the playing of traditional Chinese music, most Chinese \"yangqin\" players use a numerical notation system called \"jianpu\", rather than Western staff notation.\\n\\nSection::::Electric \"yangqin\".\\nThe \"yangqin\" has also been modified, much like an electric guitar, to be an amplified electronic instrument.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Yangqin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=734763'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '2QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7350122', 'text': \"Aliabad County\\n\\nAliabad County () is a county in Golestan Province, Iran.

He left India for Singapore at the age of seven. His father, Villayil Raman Gopala Pillai who wrote short stories and novels in Malayalam under the pen name of Njekkad had migrated to Singapore in 1947.\\nIn 1973 Chandran Nair married Ivy Goh Pek Kien.\\n\\nHe studied at Raffles Institution and University of Singapore from which he holds a Masters in Science (Marine Biology) and a Diploma in Fisheries (with distinction) but went into publishing on his graduation and worked as an international civil servant with UNESCO, first in Karachi (1981-1985), where he started painting, and then in Paris (1985 - 2004), where he now lives.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nNair started writing at an early age and his first poems were published in his school magazine The Rafflesian in 1963. His first book of poems, \"Once The Horsemen and Other Poems\", (University Education Press, Singapore), was published in 1972 and was well received as was his second collection \"After the Hard Hours, This Rain\",(Woodrose Publications, Singapore) (1975), and he has co-translated with Malcolm Koh Ho Ping \"The Poems and Lyrics of the last Lord Lee, the last Emperor of the Southern Tang Dynasty\", (Woodrose Publications, Singapore) (1975). He won The New Nation Singapore Short Story Writing contest in 1973 and has published his stories in \"Short Stories From Africa and Asia\" (which he co-edited with Theo Luzuka), \"Singapore Writing\", 1977, which he edited for the Society of Singapore Writers,\" Singapore Short Stories (Vol. 1)\" edited by Robert Yeo and also in translation in Malay in \"Cerpen Cerpen Asean\"(Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka).\\nHe was founder President of the Society of Singapore Writers from 1976 to 1981.\\n\\nSince moving to the Paris he has continued painting and writing but has not published, though he has been included in a number of anthologies including \"Calling of the Kindred\" (Cambridge Universities Press, 1993), and has been featured in \"Reworlding\" :an anthology reviewing the writing of expatriate Indians, edited by Emmanuel S Nelson (Greenwood Press, New York, 1992). He is also included in \"Idea to Ideal\", FirstFruits, Singapore 2004 - 12 Singapore poets on the writing of their poems(edited by Felix Cheong) and in \"Journeys : An Anthology of Singapore Poetry\" edited by Edwin Thumboo, 1995.\\n\\nHis poem \"Grandfather\" has been used by the University of Cambridge International Examinations Board for their examination papers.\\n\\nNair is perhaps the only Singaporean poet cited in Parliament. In a discussion about the multiracial nature of modern Singapore, Dr Chiang Hai Ding (MP for Ulu Pandan) had this to say:\\n\\n\\nTo the east where there is sunshine <br>\\nThe Mind must turn for the beginning<br>\\nof the World, in which only love matters\\n\\nSection::::Reviews.\\nNair\\'s poetry has been commented upon by local as well as foreign reviewers. Below are some of these comments.\\n\\n\". . . But this is an important book of poems. Its themes are human ones, its scenes those we can recognize, its mythology ours. And Mr Nair handles it all adroitly. Many foreigners sneer at local poetry, talking of its lack of skill (as if that is the only thing that matters) and residing in the weather-beaten towers of Eliot, Yeats and Dylan Thomas. For them, I offer Mr Nair\\'s volume of poems. It should be interesting to see his future development. We have a strong and unafraid voice among us.\"\\n\\n\". . . of all the Indians writing in English in Singapore, it is Chandran Nair, I believe, who may be said to be the most \"Indian\" in terms of literary expression. His two collections of poetry, \"Once the Horsemen and other Poems (1972)\" and \"After the Hard Hours this Rain (1975)\", reveal fairly explicit references to Indian myths, legends, landscape and spirituality. In an early poem (Grandfather) written for his grandfather, Nair clearly registers the Indian nostalgia felt deeply in contemplation. The poem is suggestive also of the position Nair himself seems to have adopted in relation to living in an environment which does not always appreciate the commitment of becoming a sensitive soul.\"(Reworlding: The Literature of the Indian Diaspora, edited by Emmanuel S Nelson.)\\n\\n\". . . Chandran is no juggler of words. He dives to the existential core of an experience and describes it without ornamentation and verbal fat. The basic struggle of a psyche responding to the pressures of an intense search for a personality that is rooted in the presentâin one\\'s own presentâbristles in each line written by this promising poet.\\n\". . . Chandran Nair is obviously a master of words. His acuteness of observation and accuracy of detail when it comes to metaphorical allusions are admirable. Even if one is dissatisfied with his handling of themes, his handling of words distinguishes him as a skilled craftsman.\"\\n\". . . Chandran Nair\\'s poetry is goodâamazingly good. First, even from a purely sociological point of view, one sees through his imagery all the varied influences of this Malaysian/Singaporean Indian and watches as the influences struggle to form, not a \"Revolving Man\" but a real \"person\". One sees the background of Hinduism work side by side with Christianity, one watches the Chinese/Malay and \"other\" influences on his Indianness, from page to page and from poem to poem. It is very interesting readingâbut even more, it is so forcefully well-written.\"\\n\\n\". . . Much of Chandran Nair\\'s poetry is exploration. \"Once the Horsemen\" (1972) communicates the variety of Nair\\'s poetic world and the note of urgency with which he attempts his themes. Image and metaphor abound and are part and parcel of \"the wrestle with experience\". For the raid into the articulate to achieve what Shelley called \"new materials of knowledge\" amounts to an essential self-understanding to harmonise the ways to thought and feeling. By taking many themes as grist for his maw, Nair\\'s poetry ranges over the feelings of a Hindu bride to the Roman Emperor, Caligula. The simultaneous forays into life and language and the myths and legends of East and West, have strengthened and extended the coordinating power of Nair\\'s idiom.\"\\n\\n\". . . For those of us who remember Chandran Nair\\'s first book of poems (Once the Horsemen, 1972), impressed with its versatility and hard brilliance of style, a second offering of poems from any poet is another matter. . . we are worried about the poet\\'s development, we search for those unhealthy signs that indicate a falling into the cliched and routined. . . If we are inclined to such ungenerous thought, Chandran Nair\\'s new volume, \"After the Hard Hours this Rain\" sets our minds at ease. Our poet is as articulately tough as ever. . .\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Chandran Nair', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7352096'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '3AE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '735272', 'text': 'Elite Eight\\n\\nIn the NCAA Men\\'s Division I Basketball Championship or the NCAA Women\\'s Division I Basketball Championship, the \"Elite Eight\" are the final eight teams and, thus represent the regional finals, or national quarterfinals.

These come on land on several consecutive nights at certain phases of the moon between July and December to dig holes in the sand and lay their eggs. Park rangers are on hand to prevent the eggs being collected and sold locally for food. The incubation period is about 48 days and after that time, millions of juvenile turtles dig their way out of the nests and try to make their way down to the sea. Predatory birds engage in a feeding frenzy at this time, so to keep them safe, some of the eggs are transported to special nursery areas where the young turtles can be protected when they hatch.

The head is blue-grey and the main body is white speckled with blue-grey spots. The tail and fins show hints of yellow and there is a rainbow streak of color behind the eyes.\\n\\n\"Canthigaster valentini\" is omnivorous, it feeds on filamentous green and red algae, tunicates, and on smaller amounts of corals, bryozoans, polychaetes, echinoderms, mollusks, and brown and coralline red algae.\\n\\nValentinni\\'s sharpnose puffer is highly poisonous to eat.\\n\\n\"C. valentini\" are occasionally found in schools together with \"Paraluteres prionurus\", a non-toxic filefish which has evolved to mimic the very toxic \"C. valentini\" for protection against predators.\\n\\nSection::::Social Groupings.\\n\"C. valentini\" organize themselves into harems dominated by one mature territorial male and containing one or more territorial females. There may also be some immature individuals of either sex present in the dominant maleâs territory. Each female has her own respective domain within the territorial maleâs. Bachelor males, males who are sexually mature but do not inhabit a territory of their own with females, are either wanderers or live near another social group. These social groups, though male dominated, were found to be defined by the female fish living within the maleâs territory. Whenever a mature female dies or is in any way removed, the mature maleâs territory shrinks to include only the domains of the living females. When a male is removed, females remain territorial, though a bachelor male will most likely takeover any territory left undefended by a territorial male.\\n\\nSection::::Reproductive Behavior.\\n\"C. valentini\" are gonochoric, approximately half of the population being male and the other half being female, distinguishable by external characteristics. Dominant males breed exclusively with the females in their territory and maintain territorial boundaries. \"C.\" valentiniâs eggs are demersal, attached to algae on coral rubble. Females can lay anywhere between fifteen and over 800 eggs at a time every four to ten days depending on the season. Spawning generally occurs between 8:00AM and 3:30PM year-round. After eggs are laid, no parental care is required because eggs are unpalatable and, thus, reasonably safe from predation. It was found that predatory fish would rarely attempt to eat the eggs of \"C. valentini\" and when eggs were ingested they would be quickly egested. This allows females and males to maintain their territory without the necessity of protecting their eggs as well.\\n\\nSection::::Eggs and Larvae.\\n\"C. valentini\" eggs range in size between 0.68 and 0.72\\xa0mm in diameter, making them some of the smallest in the family Tetraodontidae. Eggs are spherical with nine radial layers, the outermost layer possessing strong adhesive properties. After incubating for between three and five days, a relatively long incubation period for tetraodontids, \"C. valentini\" hatch around sunset at which point larvae measure between 1.30 and 1.40\\xa0mm standard length. \"C.\" valenitiniâs most rapid growth occurs in the 24 hours after they are hatched. Growth rate then declines as fish get larger. Upon hatching, larvae begin a pelagic phase that lasts between 64 and 113 days. After settlement on reefs, \"C. valentini\" are considered juveniles, having a much more robust body shape.\\n\\nSection::::Toxicity.\\nThe toxin found in \"C.\" \"valentini\" as well as in other pufferfish species is one of the most potent naturally occurring toxins. It is a neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin present in the skin and other tissues of \"C. valentini\". It is lethal to many species of fish, thus making \"C. valentini\" unpalatable to predators. Threat of predation for adults as well as larvae and eggs is low due to unpalatability, causing reproductive behaviors to differ from other species according to the reduced predation risk. Their toxic skin makes \"C. valentini\" a model for Batesian mimicry, specifically by the filefish species \"Paraluetes prionurus\" which is similarly colored, allowing it to benefit from \"C. valentini\"âs low risk of predation\".\"\\n\\nSection::::Inflation Response.\\nBesides their toxicity, \"C. valentini\" have other mechanisms for evading predation. Pufferfish, as their name indicates, have the ability to âpuffâ themselves up in order to intimidate predators. This is accomplished by filling a distensible stomach with water through rapid gulping which can increase their size to three or four times their original volume. Pufferfish must be capable of maintaining inflation for up to ten minutes in order to outlast the attention span of their predators. It was once thought that pufferfish held their breath in order to display this behavior. A 2014 study, however, found that oxygen consumption actually increases while fish are inflated. It had been previously understood that respiration through the gills ceased during inflation while cutaneous respiration increased, but this study found that cutaneous respiration is nearly nonexistent, and oxygen intake through the gills is almost five times higher than normal while \"C. valentini\" is inflated.\\n\\n', 'title': \"Valentin's sharpnose puffer\", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7392626'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8gE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7393107', 'text': 'Keith Arbuthnot\\n\\nKeith Arbuthnot may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Keith Arbuthnot', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7393107'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8wE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7394197', 'text': 'Clan Irvine\\n\\nClan Irvine (also called Irving) is a Scottish clan.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Origins of the clan.\\nSometime between 1124 and 1125 Gilchrist, son of Erwini, witnessed a charter of the Lords of Galloway. The first lands by the name of Irvine were in Dumfriesshire. According to family tradition the origin of the clan chief\\'s family is connected with the early Celtic monarchs of Scotland. Duncan Irvine settled at Bonshaw. Duncan was the brother of Crinan, who claimed descent from the High Kings of Ireland, through the Abbots of Dunkeld. Crinan married a daughter of Malcolm II of Scotland and their son was Duncan I of Scotland.\\n\\nWilliam de Irwin was a neighbor of the Clan Bruce. The Irvines supported their powerful neighbors, the Bruces, and William de Irwin became the armor bearer and secretary to king Robert the Bruce. For twenty years of faithful service William de Irwin was granted the royal forest of Drum, in Aberdeenshire, as a reward. This then became the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine. There was already a tower at Drum which was built before the end of the 13th century as a royal hunting lodge. From this grew Drum Castle, seat of the chief.\\n\\nOrigin of the crest badge â \"Robert Bruce, who, when a fugitive from the court of Edward I., concealed himself in the house of William De Irwin (William Irvine), his secretary and sword-bearer. William De Irwin followed the changing fortunes of his royal master; was with him when he was routed at Methven ; shared his subsequent dangers ; and was one of the seven who were hidden with him in a copse of holly when his pursuers passed by. When Bruce came to his own again he made him Master of the Rolls, and ten years after the battle of Bannockburn, gave him in free barony the forest of Drum, near Aberdeen. He also permitted him to use his private badge of three holly leaves, with the motto, Sub sole sub umbra virens, which are still the arms of the Irving family.\"\\n\\nSection::::15th century and clan conflicts.\\nClan Irvine was often at feud with the neighbouring Clan Keith. Both clans invaded each other\\'s lands. In 1402, Clan Irvine is said to have slaughtered an invading war party of Clan Keith at the Battle of Drumoak.\\n\\nThe third Laird of Drum was Alexander Irvine, who was the first in a line of twelve Irvines who successively bore the name Alexander. He was said to be a knight of legendary prowess and followed the Earl of Mar to the wars in France. He later fought at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, which was fought only twenty miles away from Drum itself. At Harlaw Alexander Irvine engaged in single combat with the famous \"Hector Maclean of the Battles\", chief of the Clan Maclean. Both are said to have died from wounds that they inflicted on each other. This is commemorated in a ballad about the battle as \"Gude Sir Alexander Irvine the much renounit Laird of Drum\".\\n\\nSection::::16th century and Anglo-Scottish Wars.\\nThe next Laird of Drum was a prominent figure in the negotiations to ransom James I of Scotland from the English and when the king was released de Irwyne was knighted. When the king was murdered in Perth, Sir Alexander Irvine took control of the city of Aberdeen to restore order.\\n\\nThe sixth Laird of Drum and chief of Clan Irvine was a peacemaker, and was rewarded by King James V of Scotland for his efforts to suppress rebels, thieves, reivers, sorcerers and murderers in 1527.\\n\\nDuring the Anglo-Scottish Wars the sixth Laird\\'s son was killed when the clan fought against the English at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547.\\n\\nSection::::17th century and Civil War.\\nDuring the Civil War, the royalist Irvines supported Charles I. However the Irvines lived in a mainly Covenanter district and Drum Castle was therefore an obvious target. The castle was attacked when the Laird of Drum was absent by a strong force that surrounded it with artillery. Lady Irvine surrendered and the castle was then looted. The Laird of Drum\\'s two sons both fought in the civil war and were both captured. The younger son, Robert, died in the dungeons of Edinburgh Castle, however his brother, Alexander, was freed after James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose\\'s victory at the Battle of Kilsyth in 1645. Drum Castle was again attacked, ransacked, the ladies of the house were ejected and the estate was ruined.\\n\\nSection::::18th century and Jacobite risings.\\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1715, the fourteenth Laird of Drum supported the Jacobite cause and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715 where he received a severe head wound. He never recovered from the wound and after years of illness died leaving no direct heir. The estate then passed to his uncle, John Irvine and then onto another kinsman, John Irvine of Crimond.\\n\\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Clan Irvine continued their support for the Jacobite Stuarts and fought at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The Laird of Drum escaped capture by hiding in a secret room at Drum Castle. He then lived for a few years in exile in France until he was allowed to return to his estates.\\n\\nSection::::19th and 20th centuries.\\nColonel John Irving of Bonshaw fought in the British Expedition to Abyssinia and his son, Sir Robert Irving of Bonshaw, was commodore of the Cunard Line and was captain of .\\n\\nThe twenty-second Laird of Drum fought in the Grenadier Guards during World War I.\\n\\nSection::::The clan today.\\nIn 2002 the Chief of Clan Irvine entered into a peace treaty with the 13th Earl of Kintore who is the Chief of Clan Keith at an elaborate ceremony on the banks of the River Dee to end their 600-year feud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Clan Irvine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7394197'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '9AE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7394893', 'text': 'Erik Meyn\\n\\nErik Halfdan Meyn (born July 3, 1955) is a Norwegian journalist, former TV-host and TV-director.

It is topped with branches and often well decorated with autumnal, harvest or Judaic themes. The Book of Vayikra (Leviticus) describes it as a symbolic wilderness shelter, commemorating the time God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness they inhabited after they were freed from slavery in Egypt. It is common for Jews to eat, sleep and otherwise spend time in the \"sukkah\". In Judaism, Sukkot is considered a joyous occasion and is referred to in Hebrew as \"Yom Simchateinu\" (the day of our rejoicing) or \"Z\\'man Simchateinu\" (the time of our rejoicing), and the sukkah itself symbolizes the frailty and transience of life and its dependence on God.\\n\\nSection::::Associated activities.\\nThe halakha requires eating and traditionally sleeping in the sukkah. However, Jews are not expected to remain in the sukkah if they would be very uncomfortable there. For this reason, Jews living at northern latitudes will generally not sleep in the sukkah due to the low temperatures of autumn nights. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the sukkah eating and relaxing but go indoors to sleep.\\n\\nWhen rain falls on the sukkah, one is not required to stay inside. The Mishna in Sukkah 28b compares rain falling on a sukkah to a master who receives a drink from his servant and then throws it back in the servant\\'s face. The analogy is that through the rainfall, God is showing displeasure with the performance of the mitzvah by not allowing the Jews to fulfill their obligation of sitting in the sukkah.\\n\\nIn Israel and other temperate climates (such as Florida, Australia, Texas, and Southern California), observant Jews will often conduct all their eating, studying, and sleeping activities in the sukkah. Many Jews will not eat or drink anything outside the sukkah. Others will drink or eat fruit outside the sukkah.\\n\\nIn Israel, it is common practice for hotels, restaurants, snack shops, and outdoor tourist attractions (such as zoos) to provide a Kosher sukkah for customers to dine in.\\n\\nAll Lubavitcher Hasidim and some Belzer Hasidim (especially outside Israel) do not sleep in the sukkah due to its intrinsic holiness. Though the halakha doesn\\'t obligate one to eat or sleep in the \"sukkah\" if it is raining, Lubavitcher Hasidim will still eat there.\\n\\nA popular social activity which involves people visiting each other\\'s Sukkot has become known as \"Sukkah hopping\". Food is laid out so that participants will be able to recite the various required blessings.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nAccording to \"halakha\", a sukkah is a structure consisting of a roof made of organic material which has been disconnected from the ground for the purpose of the commandment (the s\\'chach). A sukkah must have three walls. It should be at least three feet tall, and be positioned so that all or part of its roof is open to the sky. (Only the part which is under the sky is kosher.) Most authorities require its floor area to be at least 16 square cubits.\\n\\nIn practice, the walls of a sukkah can be constructed from any material that will withstand a normally anticipated terrestrial wind. If the material is not rigid and therefore will sway in the wind, the sukkah is not kosher (Talmud, Sukkah 24b). Accordingly, there is a discussion among contemporary halakhic authorities whether canvas may be used for walls: Some, such as R. Ovadiah Yosef (Shu\"t Yechaveh Da\\'at 3:46) hold that even the slightest degree of swaying in the wind will disqualify the sukkah walls, and thus canvas cannot realistically be employed. Others, such as the Chazon Ish, permit motion to and fro of less than three handbreadths, thereby facilitating the usage of canvas walls which are anchored at all sides. The specific details of what constitutes a wall, the minimum and maximum wall heights, whether there can be spaces between the walls and the roof, and the exact material required for the \"s\\'chach\" (roofing) can be found in various exegetical texts.\\n\\nA sukkah can be built on the ground or on an open porch or balcony. Indeed, many observant Jews who design their home\\'s porch or deck will do so in a fashion that aligns with their sukkah-building needs. Portable sukkot made of a collapsible metal frame and cloth walls have recently become available for those who have little space, or for those who are traveling (in order to have a place to eat one\\'s meals).\\n\\nSection::::Roof covering.\\nThe roof covering, known as \"s\\'chach\" in Hebrew, must consist of something that grew from the earth but is currently disconnected from it. Palm leaves, bamboo sticks, pine branches, wood and the like can all be used for \"s\\'chach\", unless they were processed previously for a different use.\\n\\nThere must be enough \"s\\'chach\" that inside the sukkah there should be more shade than sun. However, there must be sufficient gaps between the pieces of \"s\\'chach\" so that rain could come through.\\n\\nSection::::Decorations.\\nMany people hang decorations such as streamers, shiny ornaments, and pictures from the interior walls and ceiling beams of a sukkah. Fresh, dried or plastic fruitâincluding etrogs and the seven species for which Israel is praised (wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates; see Deuteronomy 8:8)âare popular decorations.\\n\\nSome families also line the interior walls with white sheeting, in order to recall the \"Clouds of Glory\" that surrounded the Jewish nation during their wanderings in the desert. The Chabad custom is not to decorate the sukkah, as the sukkah itself is considered to be an object of beauty.\\n\\nOne turn-of-the-century Sabbath Observer decorated a Succah wall with his stack of \"Pink Slips\" that he had convinced multiple employers to give: \"one small favor\" (the timing approximates the beginning of this practice, 1910).\\n\\nSection::::Associated prayers.\\nSection::::Blessing.\\nAccording to Jewish law, one must recite the following blessing when using the sukkah. The blessing is normally recited after the blessing made on food, such as on bread or cake:\\n\\nTransliteration: \"\"\\n\\nTranslation: \"Blessed are You, L, our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the sukkah.\"\\n\\nSection::::Ushpizin.\\nDuring the holiday, some Jews recite the \"ushpizin\" prayer which symbolizes the welcoming of seven \"exalted guests\" into the sukkah. These \"ushpizin\", or guests, represent the seven shepherds of Israel: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David. According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the sukkah followed by the other six. Each of the \"ushpizin\" parallels the spiritual focus of the day on which they visit.\\n\\nIn Chabad tradition, an additional set of corresponding \"chasidic\" ushpizin enter the sukkah, beginning with the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of Mezeritch and continuing with the consecutive rebbes of the Chabad Hasidic dynasty.\\n\\nSection::::Notable examples.\\nSection::::Drive-through.\\nIn 2010, Bet Shira Congregation in Miami, Florida, erected a tent as a drive-through Sukkah, dubbed \"McBet Shira Sukkah\", in the parking lot of the synagogue.\\n\\nSection::::Sukkah City.\\nSukkah City was a public art and architecture competition planned for New York City\\'s Union Square Park. The winning design was chosen as the City Sukkah, to stand, starting on September 22, 2010, for the requisite seven days of the harvest holiday.

Two trains collided head-on while one track of a double track line was out of service for maintenance. Six people, including the drivers of both trains, were killed: two Luxembourgers and four French. Twenty more were injured in the accident, two seriously.\\n\\nSection::::Circumstances.\\nOne train was a Class 2200 double-decker passenger train of the Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), running on the MÃ©trolor service (TER Lorraine) from the city of Luxembourg to Nancy, France. The other was an SNCF freight train composed of 22 wagons on the BÃ¢le â Thionville â Bettembourg route. They were involved in a head-on collision. This type of accident, called (\"Nose to Nose\") in French railway jargon, is relatively rare and often fatal. One of the most fatal head-on collisions in France was the 1985 Flaujac train collision, which left 35 dead and 120 injured. The most recent accident of this kind happened on the Tende line on 27 January 2003 where a French and an Italian train collided, killing both drivers.\\n\\nThe accident occurred between the border stations of Hettange-Grande (France) and Bettembourg (Luxembourg), near the Lorraine area of Zoufftgen, on a double track section. The accident was on a section crossing a forest, limiting visibility. The speed limits of the trains were and .\\n\\nOnly a single track was being used because of engineering works. The line was electrified at 25 kV AC, and equipped, between Thionville and Bettembourg, with BAL (, \"automatic signal blocks\") and IPCS (, \"permanent counter-track installations\") which allow trains to run in one or other direction, the signalling and the interlocking being preconfigured to achieve this. Both trains were equipped with safety systems, KVB (, \"Speed control by beacons\") on the French side and Memor II+ on the Luxembourg side, which in particular halts the train if it passes a stop signal.\\n\\nSection::::Response.\\nThe prÃ©fecture of Moselle had made a \"White plan\" (an emergency plan) to organise the response. Hundreds of French and Luxembourger rescue workers were marshalled:\\n\\nThe \"Red plan\" was lifted two days after the accident, shortly after the sixth and last victim had been extricated.\\n\\nSection::::Investigations.\\nSection::::Preliminary.\\nAccording to the preliminary investigation, validated by the prefecture of the Department of Moselle and the Luxembourg authorities, the accident had caused:\\n\\nSection::::Inquiries.\\nThe accident being in both France and Luxembourg, judicial inquiries were opened by the authorities in both Thionville and Luxembourg. At the same time, other inquiries were started: in France, by the SNCF and the BEA-TT (, \"Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau\") by the French Minister of Transport, and in Luxembourg, by the CFL and the (\"Inquiry Agency for Incidents and Accidents\"), in concert with the BEA-TT.\\n\\nOn 8 October 2007, the court of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg indicted six CFL employees on charges of manslaughter and actual bodily harm. After investigation, indictments of two board members of the CFL were dropped. While no individual has been identified, it was stated that among the accused were two traffic controllers.\\n\\nSection::::Later.\\nAfter further investigations by SNCF and CFL, railway officials came to the conclusion that the fault lay with the Luxembourg rail traffic controllers who cleared the passenger train onto the same track as the freight train. Luxembourg\\'s Transport Minister Lucien Lux was quoted as saying \"It\\'s tough to say, but it\\'s the fault of the CFL.\"\\n\\nSection::::Analysis.\\nThe Luxembourger driver of TER 837\\xa0617 received an order to pass a red (stop) signal to enter the zone operated by freight train number 45\\xa0938, pulled by SNCF Class BB 37000 locomotive 37007 from the Thionville depot, which had entered the section as normal by passing a green signal.\\n\\nThe accident was due to a human signalling error on the Luxembourg side, according to information from the Luxembourg Minister of Transport on 15 October 2006.\\n\\nThe CFL accepted that the double-deck passenger train (Class 2200), travelling from Luxembourg to Nancy, had passed a red signal with the authorisation of the head signaller at Bettembourg. The signaller had not followed procedure in its entirety, and had not confirmed with the signal box at Thionville that the way was clear, probably not considering the possibility of another train having been delayed (in fact, the freight train). The Bettembourg signal box thus authorised the TER train to proceed on the track past a red signal which had already cleared the freight train from the opposite direction.\\n\\nHaving realised the mistake, the signaller at Bettembourg triggered an alert by RST (, \"Train Radio System\"), which was not received by the driver of the passenger train. He then wanted to cut the electricity supply for the line, but this was not possible because of the different rail electrification systems of the two countries; moreover the Luxembourg train had already passed to the French side, and so was beyond the signaller\\'s control.\\n\\nSection::::Crumple zones.\\nThe Class 2200 rolling stock was extremely new (2004) and had crumple zones that progressively collapsed in the event of overriding (locomotive BB 37007 going under the CFL locomotive).\\n\\nThe cab of locomotive BB 37007 was destroyed by the force of the collision, but the rest of the leading structure remained \"coherent\". The crumple zone had been compressed. The driver, stuck in the cab, had no escape. The trailing wagons left the track to the right (in the direction of the train) after their couplings failed.\\n\\nThe head motor car of the CFL train, built on the same assembly line as the SNCF train, had had its cabin crushed by the force of the collision and the roof was torn off by the overriding locomotive; however the intermediate trailing wagons and the tail motor car remained on the track, because the ends of each of the cars in between had anti-override structures which \"locked\" against each other in case of shock. These structures led to the high number of survivors.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Zoufftgen train collision', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7407565'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '-QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7408578', 'text': 'Bruce (ship)\\n\\nBruce was a 1,200-ton sailing ship built in 1866 by Aitken Mansell of Glasgow, Scotland.

As a young man, Mooney was a professional pianist. He attended Brooklyn and St. John\\'s Law Schools. After studying music under New York University professor Orville Mayhood and then under the influential Joseph Schillinger, he was invited to join the arrangers\\' roster for the popular Hal Kemp Orchestra, alongside John Scott Trotter (who was about to leave the band) and Lou Busch.\\n\\nMooney then moved to the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, but World War II was breaking out and soon he was called up by the United States Army.\\n\\nSection::::Hollywood.\\nOn his return from the war, Mooney became a freelance arranger in Hollywood and started to make a name for himself, providing charts for top vocalists such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Peggy Lee, Kay Starr, and Billy Eckstine.\\n\\nSection::::The Mercury years.\\nIn 1956, Mooney finally swapped freelancing for an exclusive contract, becoming in-house arranger and A&R Director at Mercury Records, where he would remain until the late 1960s. There, he provided arrangements for another raft of top singers, including Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Helen Merrill, Ernestine Anderson and, on Mercury\\'s parent label Philips Records, Nina Simone.\\n\\nMooney was described as a \"nuts and bolts arranger\" by fellow chart writer Billy May. It was meant as a compliment, and Mooney\\'s versatility can be characterised by some of the more notable arrangements he wrote at the Mercury stable. For Vaughan, he provided lush, string settings (along with more brassy, upbeat numbers) on albums such as \"Great Songs From Hit Shows\" (1956) and \"Sarah Vaughan Sings George Gershwin\" (1957). Though those arrangements grated with some jazz purists, their dramatic qualities inspired the acclaimed singer to some of her finest work, for example \"Hit Shows\" \"It Never Entered My Mind\" and the Gershwin album\\'s \"Isn\\'t It a Pity?\". Apart from such highbrow projects, Mooney also arranged some of Vaughan\\'s forays into R&B-inspired \\'50s pop, for example the Clyde Otis-penned \"Sweet Affection\" (1957).\\n\\nMooney\\'s numerous arrangements for Dinah Washington, meanwhile, ranged from straight big band swing, through Latin mambo to rhythm and blues, but the seven albums on which he worked with Simone, between 1964 and 1967, display the greatest versatility. Though they contain the occasional string-backed track not unlike Mooney\\'s classic work with Vaughan, they took him a world away from it at other times. For example, Simone\\'s final Philips album, \"High Priestess of Soul\" (1967), is a diverse combination of pop, jazz and gospel. Mooney\\'s two best-known arrangements for Simone, \"I Put A Spell On You\" and \"Feelin\\' Good\", might be quite different in some ways to his earlier work with Vaughan, but the same sense of drama is evident.\\n\\nIn his A&R capacity, Mooney helped to woo Xavier Cugat to Mercury, and he also produced several albums, including Dizzy Gillespie\\'s \"Jambo Caribe\" (1964) and Vaughan\\'s penultimate work for Mercury \"It\\'s a Man\\'s World\" (1967), for which Mooney also arranged some of the songs.\\n\\nSection::::As composer and recording artist.\\nMooney recorded numerous orchestral albums in his own name, such as \"Ballet With A Beat\" (1961), which fused famous ballet melodies such as \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" and \"Sabre Dance\" with West Coast jazz, and the earlier \"Musical Horoscope\", for which Mooney composed a different tune for each of the signs of the zodiac.\\n\\nHaving joined ASCAP in 1936, Mooney\\'s compositions included \"Rigamarole\", \"Hodge-Podge\", \"Jumpin\\' Jiminy\", \"Sing, It\\'s Good For Ya\", and \"Goin\\' to Town\".\\n\\nSection::::The Universal years.\\nPhilips decided to phase out the Mercury label in the late 1960s and so Mooney moved on to Universal Studios, where he became musical director on many of the most popular TV shows of the 1970s, including \"Columbo\", \"Kojak\", \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Ellery Queen\", \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", \"The Bionic Woman\", \"\" and \"The Rockford Files\". His film work included the score to the Richard Burton war film \"Raid on Rommel\" (1971), as well as television movies such as \"The Longest Night\" (1972), \"Runaway!\" (1973), \"Sunshine\" (1973), \"A Case of Rape\" (1974) and \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" (1974).\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nHal Mooney retired after composing the musical score to the 1977 television series \"The Storyteller\".

It is a 32-bit implementation, and was in part a response to Digital Equipment Corporation\\'s (DEC) VAX computer. The project was headed by Jon L White, with a stated goal of maintaining compatibility with MacLisp while fixing many of its problems.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Lisp language was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy while he was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). From its inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence (AI) research community, especially on PDP-10 systems. The 36-bit word size of the PDP-6 and PDP-10 was influenced by the usefulness of having two Lisp 18-bit pointers in one word: \"The PDP-6 project started in early 1963, as a 24-bit machine. It grew to 36 bits for LISP, a design goal.\" Lisp was used as the implementation of the programming language Micro Planner that was the foundation for the famous AI system SHRDLU. Lisp, in particular Maclisp (so named because it originated at MIT\\'s project MAC) was also used to implement the Macsyma computer algebra system. In the 1970s, as AI research spawned commercial offshoots, the performance of extant Lisp systems became a growing problem.\\n\\nPartly because of garbage collection (Lisp would use stop-and-copy garbage collection of its single heap for memory allocation) and partly because of its representation of internal structures, Lisp became difficult to run on the memory-limited stock computer hardware of the day. This led to creating Lisp machines: dedicated hardware for running Lisp environments and programs. An alternative was to use the more powerful commodity hardware which was becoming available, especially the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX.\\n\\nNIL was an implementation of Lisp developed at MIT in the mid to late 1970s, and intended to be a modern successor to Maclisp that was able to run on stock hardware, in contrast to Lisp Machine Lisp for the Lisp machines. \"Originally designed as the first modern Lisp dialect on stock hardware after the development of Lisp machine Lisp at MIT, it went on to become one of the main influences on the design of Common Lisp.\" (pg 63/294 of ) Since the users of the Macsyma program represented a large potential user base for NIL, it was necessary that NIL would be a large, complex system, and that speed would be imperative. For example, high-speed bignums was a requirement to support Macsyma, since NIL would be a failure with slow bignums. Consequently, NIL ended up with a large base of VAX assembly language. These requirements led to a very aggressive and complex optimization strategy which was applied prematurely, with negative results on the final system.\\n\\nConcurrent with the effort to write NIL, a research group at Stanford University and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory headed by Richard P. Gabriel were investigating the design of a Lisp to run on the S-1 Mark IIA supercomputer, S-1 Lisp. That Lisp was never fully functional, but was a test bed for implementing advanced compiler methods in a Lisp. Eventually the S-1 and NIL groups began collaborating.\\n\\nAlthough unsuccessful in meeting its goals as a used language, NIL was important in several ways. First, it brought together Jon L. White, Guy L. Steele Jr., and Richard P. Gabriel, who were later to define Common Lisp. Second, Jonathan Rees worked on part of the NIL project during a year away from Yale University. On returning to Yale, he was hired by the computer science department to write a new Lisp, which became the optimizing, native code Scheme system named T. In part, NIL begat this name, since \"T is not NIL\".\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'NIL (programming language)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7415350'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7416321', 'text': 'Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)\\n\\n\"Q2\" is the 18th episode of the of the American science fiction television series \".\" It initially aired on the UPN network as the 165th episode of the Star Trek franchise overall, and was directed by \"\" castmember LeVar Burton (Geordi La Forge).\\n\\nThe series follows the adventures of the Federation starship \"Voyager\" during its journey home to Earth, having been stranded tens of thousands of light-years away. In this episode, Q (John de Lancie) stops by to leave his undisciplined son (Keegan de Lancie) (conceived at the end of \"The Q and the Grey\") in the care of his \"godmother\", Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew).\\n\\nThis episode marks the last on-screen appearance of \"Q\", and features \"Q\" actor John de Lancie\\'s real-life son Keegan as the young \"Q\".\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nQ (John de Lancie) shows up on USS \"Voyager\" to introduce Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to her godson, Q Junior (Keegan de Lancie), who now has the appearance of a human teenager. Q Junior is rambunctious and troublesome, causing various incidents across the ship. Q explains to Janeway that the Continuum hoped his son would help stabilize the Continuum but instead started the same type of problems on a much larger scale such as tearing holes in the fabric of space-time. The Continuum blamed Q and plans to turn Q Junior into an amoeba. Q brought him to \"Voyager\" to hopefully have Q Junior learn something. Janeway suggests some \"father-son\" time, but after ten minutes, Q admits that doesn\\'t help as Q Junior had just rearranged the tectonic plates on a nearby planet. Janeway asserts that Q Junior needs to learn there are consequences of his actions.\\n\\nBy order of the Continuum, Q strips Q Junior of his powers and departs. Q Junior still manages to cause trouble, but after a stern talking-to by Janeway, he improves his ways, even becoming friends with Icheb (Manu Intiraymi). When Q returns, he appears to have little interest in Q Junior\\'s progress before departing. Q Junior becomes depressed, and decides to take Icheb on a tour of the galaxy in the \"Delta Flyer\". They encounter a Chokuzan vessel that fires on them with a neural weapon that knocks Icheb unconscious. Q Junior races the \"Flyer\" back to \"Voyager\", and pleads with the Doctor (Robert Picardo) to help find a cure for his friend. The Doctor is unable to identify how to cure Icheb, and Q refuses to save the life of someone his son put in danger, hoping that would teach him a lesson. When Janeway hears of this, she takes Q Junior along to locate the Chokuzan ship, hoping to learn how to heal Icheb. When they reach the ship, the Chokuzans demand someone bear punishment for the responsibility of the previous encounter. Janeway attempts to take responsibility as the captain of the ship, but Q Junior asserts it was his fault. Suddenly, it is revealed that this was all a ploy by Q; the Chokuzan ship never existed, and Icheb is restored to full health.\\n\\nThey return to \"Voyager\" where Q stands trial to the Continuum. They decide that while Q Junior has shown some improvement, he will still be exiled from the Continuum and left as a human forever. Q angrily departs following this decision. He returns later and speaks to Janeway, explaining that he told the Continuum that if they exiled his son, he would leave it too, and because of his importance to the stability of the Continuum, they had no choice but to restore Q Junior\\'s powers, as long as Q took eternal custody of his son. Q Junior uses his powers to fill Janeway\\'s ready room with roses before leaving as a token of thanks. Q also shows his appreciation to Janeway by giving her information to help shave a few years on their return trip to Earth. Though thankful for that, Janeway asks why Q did not take them all the way home, to which he replies that he would be setting himself as a bad example for his son if he did all the work for her, before disappearing.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nThe episode was noted as tenth funniest episodes of the Star Trek franchise, by CBR in 2019.

He has played county cricket in England for the past ten years for five first-class teams Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex and Somerset.\\n\\nDespite being colour blind and short sighted, he maintained a first-class average of nearly 50, yet he did not play for the Australia national cricket team until the age of 30, when he was selected for a single Test match in 2008. He was recalled to the Australia national team for the 2013 Ashes series, aged 35, and over the following two years played a further 24 Tests opening the batting for Australia before retiring after the 2015 Ashes series.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn in St George, Sydney, Rogers\\' father, John Rogers played for New South Wales between 1969 and 1970. He is also a cousin of Australian chess grandmaster Ian Rogers.\\n\\nRogers made one Youth Test match appearance, against New Zealand in 1996. Rogers\\' batting talent had led some to anoint him as the next Australian opener, replacing Justin Langer.\\n\\nSection::::Domestic career.\\nHe first came to England in 1996 to play in the Devon Cricket League for North Devon CC under the watchful eye of former Gloucestershire player and Test match umpire David Shepherd. He came back the following year to score a league record aggregate of 1,273 runs but could not save the Instow Club from relegation.\\n\\nIn 2002 he played for Exeter, also in the Devon League, and in 2003 he returned to England once again to play for Wellington CC in the Shropshire League The welter of runs he contributed saw them move from the Furrow\\'s Shropshire League to the Birmingham League where they were again promoted. He was unable to play Minor Counties cricket but did make one appearance for Shropshire in the Nat West Trophy where overseas players were allowed, but made a duck in his only game.\\n\\nHe made his first trip into English First Class cricket playing for Derbyshire in 2004, where despite suffering from a shoulder injury, played well. He moved to Leicestershire in the second half of the 2005 season, where he averaged over 70, and scored one double-century against the touring Australians. In 2006 he moved to Northamptonshire and immediately made his mark with fifty fours, two sixes, and a final score of 319 from 417 balls against Gloucestershire.\\n\\nIn October 2006 he and Marcus North put on a record domestic third wicket partnership of 459, Western Australia v Victoria, at the WACA. Rogers\\' score of 279 was the second highest ever by a West Australian, behind the 355 not out that Geoff Marsh scored at the same ground in December 1989. On 5 February 2007 Rogers was awarded the \\'State Cricket Player of the Year\\' prize at the Allan Border Medal presentation.\\n\\nHe returned to Derbyshire for the 2008 season, playing as their overseas player when Mahela Jayawardene declared himself unavailable due to his commitments with Sri Lanka and the Indian Premier League, and has since become the temporary captain after the resignation of Rikki Clarke. Despite being both short-sighted and colourblind (a fact that was said to put him at a bigger disadvantage when using the pink ball for the first day-night test against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval), Rogers has proven himself to be a sharp player both at and away from the crease. Rogers has also played for Shropshire, representing them during one match of the C&G Trophy.\\nIn 2008, he walked out on the Western Warriors, reportedly over his status as a fringe-player in the state\\'s one-day team, and joined Victoria for the 2008/2009 season. \\n\\nIn 2008, Rogers hit 248 not out, carrying his bat for Derbyshire against Warwickshire. The score is the third-highest single-innings total in a first-class match by a Derbyshire player, and the highest score for 62 years. The innings meant Rogers had registered a double century for all four first-class domestic teams that he had represented.\\n\\nIn 2010, after relinquishing the Derbyshire captaincy to Greg Smith, Rogers joined Middlesex for the 2011 season, and was appointed captain of the first-class County Championship side in 2014. \\n\\nIn 2016 he joined Somerset, being appointed captain of the Championship side on his arrival. Rogers retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2016 season; in his final match for Somerset he made twin hundreds in their 325-run victory over Nottinghamshire. \\n\\nSection::::International career.\\nIn May 2007, Rogers was awarded his first national contract with Cricket Australia. On 13 January 2008, he was added to the Australia Test squad as a cover for the injured Matthew Hayden, who had torn a hamstring, and he made his Test debut in the third Test against India at the WACA Ground on 16 January, but the Baggy Green had to be replaced a day later because Rogers\\' cap was too small, and he unsuccessfully tried to make it bigger to alleviate headaches caused by fielding all day in the scorching heat. Australia were chasing a world-record 17th consecutive Test victory, but found the going difficult. Rogers scored four runs in the first innings of 212 and 15 in the second innings as Australia unsuccessfully chased a target of over 400. His national contract was subsequently terminated in April 2008. Rogers commented that he \"didn\\'t see it coming, I\\'ll have to accept it and try to get back in.\"\\n\\nOn 24 April 2013 and at age 35, Rogers was named in the 16-man Australian Test squad for the 2013 Ashes tour in England, more than five years after his previous Test. He opened the batting throughout the series, partnering initially with Shane Watson and later with David Warner, and made 367 runs at 40.77 for the series to be Australia\\'s third-highest scorer. Rogers scored his maiden Test century in the first innings of the fourth Test, in difficult seaming conditions at the Riverside International Cricket Ground, Durham.\\n\\nFollowing his success in England, Rogers held his place as an opening batsman for the next two years. In the return Ashes series in the 2013/14 summer, Rogers scored 463 runs at 46.30 to again be Australia\\'s third-highest scorer. He scored his second Test century, and his first on Australian soil, in Australia\\'s successful fourth-innings run-chase in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground,<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 26â29 December 2013 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 â Australia v England\"></ref> and he backed that up with his third Test century in the second innings of the New Year\\'s Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground with a score of 119.<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 3â5 January 2014 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 â Australia v England\"></ref> He then scored a rearguard century of 107 against South Africa in the second innings of the second Test in Port Elizabeth in February 2014,<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 20â23 February 2014 - Australia tour of South Africa, 2013/14 â South Africa v Australia\"></ref> which was his only score above 50 in the series where he averaged 30.16. A two-Test series in the UAE against Pakistan in late 2014 was the leanest of Rogers\\' career, managing only 88 runs at 22.00.\\n\\nRogers returned to form during the 2014/15 summer, scoring 417 runs at 52.12 in the four-Test home series against India. He failed to score a century in the series, but managed consecutive half-centuries over his last six innings. He toured with Australia in its 2015 tour of the West Indies, but missed both matches with concussion after being struck in the head during a net session.\\n\\nRogers returned from his concussion the following month for the 2015 Ashes series in England, which he had announced before the tour would be his last before retiring from international cricket. He extended his sequence of consecutive Test half-centuries to a record-equalling seven innings in the first Test at Cardiff, before being dismissed for ten in the second innings. He batted through the entire first day on his way to the highest score of his Test career (173) in the first innings of the second Test at Lord\\'s, and made an unbeaten 49 before retiring hurt in the second innings after suffering a dizzy spell. He finished the series with 480 runs at 60.00, the highest average across both teams, and was awarded Australian Player of the Series.\\n\\nDespite a relatively short career of 25 Tests, Rogers retired having gained admiration for his watchful, consistent batting at the top of the order; in particular, during the two Ashes series he played in England, he was one of Australia\\'s most consistent batsmen in the seaming and swinging conditions. For all but the first few Tests of his international career, he formed a successful opening partnership with David Warner, generally playing an anchoring role to Warner\\'s more aggressive style; in only 41 innings together, the pair shared nine century partnerships.\\n\\nRogers received a belated sendoff at the 2015 Boxing Day Test where he rode a lap of honour around the MCG and received a mushroom stand to rest his Baggy Green cap.\\n\\nSection::::Career best performances.\\n\"as of 23 August 2015\"\\n', 'title': 'Chris Rogers (cricketer)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7430512'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7431437', 'text': 'Magic: The Gathering formats\\n\\n\"Magic: The Gathering\" formats are various ways in which the \"\" collectible card game can be played. Each format provides rules for deck construction and gameplay, with many confining the pool of permitted cards to those released in a specified group of \"Magic\" . The DCI, the governing body that oversees official \"Magic\" competitive play, categorizes its tournament formats into Constructed and Limited. \\n\\nConstructed formats require decks to be made prior to participation, with players allowed to use any tournament-legal cards they possess. Sanctioned Constructed formats include Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Vintage. Limited formats, in contrast, utilize a restricted and unknown pool of cards, usually formed by opening \"Magic\" products. Limited competition require players to select cards and build decks on the fly within the tournament itself. The primary two sanctioned Limited formats are Sealed Deck and Booster Draft. \\n\\nA number of other formats have been designed by Wizards of the Coast or by players for custom gameplay or reduced investment cost; these are known as casual formats. Some casual formats utilize rules or sets of cards that differ from those used in sanctioned tournament play. \\n\\nSection::::Official formats.\\nThe term \"sanctioned\" refers to formats that the DCI allows to be run at official events. Many of the deck construction rules are shared across both sanctioned and casual formats. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of some of the major formats.\\n\\nSection::::Constructed.\\nConstructed formats, as opposed to Limited formats, allow players to build decks from the entirety of the legal cards available in the specified format. The formats differ based on the card pool allowed, which affects each format\\'s accessibility, power level, and complexity. In Constructed format tournaments, players build their deck in advance of the tournament. Of the constructed formats, the most popular are Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, and Pauper.\\n\\nThe following rules apply to most sanctioned Constructed formats:\\n\\nSection::::Pauper.\\nPauper is a Magic variant in which card legality is based on printed rarity. In Pauper, only common cards are legal, or rather any card printed at common rarity, by deck construction rules. It is largely known as a \"Magic Online\" format, although paper Pauper events have been run using the MTGO legality list. It was added as an official format on \"Magic Online\" December 1, 2008. \\n\\nSection::::Standard.\\nThe Standard format is continually one of the most popular formats in the constructed deck tournament scene. It is the format most commonly found at Friday Night Magic tournaments, played weekly at many hobby shops. Standard\\'s former name was \"Type 2\". This format generally consists of the most recent three or four \"Block\" releases. The release of the first set of a new Block in Autumn (usually the first Friday in October) triggers a rotation; the new Block becomes Standard legal, and the oldest two blocks rotate out. (The previous rule was using two recent \"Block\" releases plus any core sets released between the older set of the block and the first set that would make that block rotated out). The current Standard set includes the \"Ixalan\" block, \"Dominaria\", \"Guilds of Ravnica\" and Core Set 2019. Additionally, cards appeared in \"Welcome Deck 2017\" and cards from \"Global Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling\" (only applied to events inside People\\'s Republic of China) are also legal in current Standard.\\n\\nFor a list of which sets were legal in the past, or notable deck archetypes, see .\\n\\nSection::::Modern.\\nModern is a constructed format created by Wizards of the Coast in the Spring of 2011 as a response to the increasing popularity of the Legacy format which, although popular, proved difficult to access due to the high price of staple cards, as well as dissatisfaction with the Extended format of the time. Wizards of the Coast is unwilling to reprint some of these cards due to the Reserved List, a list of cards Wizards promised never to reprint in order to protect card prices. Therefore, Modern was designed as a new format that would exclude all cards on the Reserved List, allowing the format to be more accessible than Legacy.\\n\\nModern allows cards from all core sets beginning with the core set and all expansions printed afterwards. The core set was when Magic cards began to be printed in modern card frames, and this is where the name for the format is derived. Wizards believed this cutoff would have the advantage of giving a visual cue as to which cards are legal in the Modern format.\\n\\nThe format maintains its own banned list. Cards are banned on the basis of their power level, as in all constructed formats outside Vintage. The first official tournament to be held using the format was in September 2011. The first Grand Prix to use the format was Grand Prix Lincoln in February 2012.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nLegacy allows cards from all sets (known as an \"Eternal\" format). It maintains a ban list based on power level reasons. The format evolved from Type 1.5, which allowed cards from all sets and maintained a banned list corresponding to Vintage: all cards banned or restricted in the old Type 1 were banned in Type 1.5. The modern Legacy format began in 2004, as the DCI separated Legacy\\'s banned list from Vintage and banned many new cards to reduce the power level of the format.\\n\\nWizards has supported the format with Grand Prix events and the release of preconstructed Legacy decks on \"Magic Online\" in November 2010. The first Legacy was in 2005.\\n\\nSection::::Vintage.\\nThe Vintage format, formerly known as Type 1, is another Eternal constructed format. Vintage maintains a small banned list and a larger restricted list. Unlike in the other formats, the DCI does not ban cards in Vintage for power level reasons. Rather, cards banned in Vintage are those that either involve , manual dexterity (, ), or could hinder event rundown ( and Conspiracy cards). Cards that raise power level concerns are instead restricted to a maximum of one copy per deck. Vintage is currently the only format in which cards are restricted. Because of the expense in acquiring the old cards to play competitive Vintage, many Vintage tournaments are unsanctioned and permit players to use a certain number of proxy cards. These are treated as stand-ins of existing cards and are not normally permitted in tournaments sanctioned by the DCI.\\n\\nSection::::Limited.\\nLimited formats are so-called because they require players to build their decks from a more limited pool of cards than Constructed formats. Limited formats require players to open a specified number of \"Magic\" products, they then must work exclusively with the cards that came from that product. Due to the nature of Limited formats, players cannot build their decks in advance of the tournament and must build their deck within the tournament itself. There are currently three sanctioned Limited formats: Sealed Deck, Booster Draft, and Rochester Draft. Though the latter was no longer used in current competitive-level events.\\n\\nThe following rules apply to all current sanctioned Limited formats:\\n\\nSection::::Sealed Deck.\\nIn Sealed Deck tournaments, each player receives six booster packs to build a deck. Depending on which sets are to be used in a sealed deck event, the distribution of packs can vary greatly. For example, a \"Magic 2010\" sealed deck event consists of six \"Magic 2010\" boosters, but a sanctioned \"Shards of Alara\" block sealed deck event consists of two \"Shards of Alara\", two \"Conflux\", and two \"Alara Reborn\" booster packs.\\n\\nSection::::Booster Draft.\\nIn a booster draft, several players (usually eight) are seated around a table and each player is given three booster packs. Each player opens a pack, selects a card from it and passes the remaining cards to his or her left. Each player then selects one of the remaining cards from the pack that was just passed to him or her, and passes the remaining cards to the left again. This continues until all of the cards are depleted. The process is repeated with the second and third packs, except that the cards are passed to the right in the second pack. Players then build decks out of any cards that they selected during the drafting and add as many basic lands as they choose. Each deck built this way must have a minimum of 40 cards, including basic lands.\\n\\nSection::::Rochester Draft.\\nRochester Draft is a booster draft variant that was commonly used as a format in Pro Tour and Grand Prix. Although it is still a sanctioned format, it has not () been used as a Grand Prix/Pro Tour format since .\\n\\nThe format differs from traditional booster draft in that packs are opened one at a time and are laid out for each player to see. Players openly pick one card from the pack in turn. Once each player has picked a card from the booster pack, the draft order reverses so that the last player to draft a card from the pack takes the next draft pick and then passes the pack back the way it came. Once each player has opened a booster and followed this process, the final player to open a booster opens their next booster and the draft pick order is reversed. The process is repeated until each player has opened three booster packs each and all the cards in those packs have been drafted.\\n\\nSection::::Sanctioned Multiplayer.\\nTraditionally, Magic is a game that is played between two players, however, it is also possible to play with multiple players. Despite the existence of numerous multiplayer formats, Two-Headed Giant is currently the only multiplayer format that has been officially sanctioned by the DCI.\\n\\nSection::::Two-Headed Giant.\\nTwo-Headed Giant (2HG) is a team game where pairs of players share turns and life totals. Each player has their own separate deck and plays independently of their teammate, however, teammates share the goal of defeating the opposing team.\\n\\nThe Two-Headed Giant format can be used to play Constructed or Limited games. In Constructed Two-Head Giant, no cards can be used by both members of the team, except basic land cards.\\n\\nIn June 2005, rules for handling multiplayer games were added to the official rulebook, and \"Two-Headed Giant\" team play became the first multiplayer format to be sanctioned by the DCI. The first Two-Headed Giant was in 2007. The first and thus far only to be held under the Two-Headed Giant format was in 2007.\\n\\nOn June 8, 2018, Battlebond was release as the first Two-Headed Giant-focused booster set.\\n\\nSection::::Casual formats.\\nCasual play groups and even Wizards of the Coast have developed many alternative formats for playing the game. These formats are designed to accommodate larger numbers of players, to allow two or more players to work together as a team, or create specific requirements for deck construction. They are distinct from the officially sanctioned formats such as Legacy, Vintage, Modern, Standard, or Block Constructed, which are organized by the DCI and merely define the available card pool, but don\\'t change the rules.\\n\\nMany of these variants are popular in tournament play, though not all have support from Wizards of the Coast. Several casual formats have been implemented in \"\".\\n\\nSection::::Casual Constructed.\\nAs with sanctioned formats, most casual formats can be categorized into Constructed or Limited formats. Casual constructed formats include:\\n\\nSection::::Peasant.\\nWhile in Pauper only common cards are legal, in Peasant a deck may contain up to 5 uncommon cards and the rest must be common. Peasant Magic was created by Rob Baranowski who felt that players with limited access to cards should still have an opportunity for competitive play. Tournaments for this format have taken place at Gen Con since 2001. However, the original banned list is considered to be outdated and most tournaments are played by the rules of the largest active Peasant community.\\n\\nSection::::Frontier.\\nFrontier is a format developed by Japanese stores Hareruya and BigMagic in 2016. It is similar to Modern in its deck construction rules, but with a later start date; card sets are legal from \"Magic 2015\" onwards.\\n\\nSection::::Rainbow Stairwell.\\nIn the Rainbow Stairwell format, players make a 60 card deck utilizing six cards from each and colorless. These six cards must have a converted ranging from one to six, with each card taking up one of six slots. Rules differ on what is allowed for the 24 land slots, with the simplest rule being 4 of each type of basic land; others allow nonbasic lands, but only if the entire cycle is used.\\n\\nSection::::Singleton.\\nIn the Singleton format, players are allowed to use only one of each card instead of the usual limit of four. This variation is also known as \"Highlander\" (named after the catchphrase \"\"There can be only one\"\" of the movies), \"Legendary\" (in \"Magic\", before the Magic 2014 Core Set rule change, there could only be one of any legend card in the game), or \"Restricted\" (tournament formats with a restricted list insist that decks have no more than one of those cards) Magic. Some players of this format require that the decks have a minimum of 100 cards, ban sideboards, and institute a special rule for mulligans with hands having either too many or too few lands.\\n\\nSection::::Tribal Wars.\\nTribal Wars is a constructed casual format in which one-third of every deck must be of a single . Common tribes in Magic include elves, goblins, and merfolk. Certain cards are banned in the \"Magic Online\" variant of Tribal Wars that would be overly swingy against known enemy Tribal decks, such as or .\\n\\nSection::::Warband.\\nWarband is a casual constructed format in which decks (colloquially called \"warbands\") have a minimum size of 40 cards. Furthermore, Warband is a singleton format, and the main deck may only contain up to 3 rare/mythic cards (\"captains\") and up to 9 uncommon cards (\"lieutenants\"), in addition to any number of common cards. Warband can be played with any cardpool, but is primarily played with Standard or Legacy cardpools. Warband is intended to be inexpensive and accessible, whilst allowing for complex gameplay with large card sets.\\n\\nSection::::Vintage Artist Constructed.\\nVintage Artist Constructed is a casual constructed format in which every card in the deck must be illustrated by the same artist, including basic lands. Cards illustrated by more than 1 artist are allowed but one of the artists must be the one selected for the deck. Deck construction uses the Vintage card pool including banned and restricted lists.\\n\\nSection::::Casual Limited.\\nLimited casual formats include all the sanctioned formats as well.\\n\\nSection::::Cube Draft.\\nCube Draft is a booster draft variant in which the pool of cards is a predetermined set of cards chosen for the purpose of drafting them. The pool of cards is known as a Cube and usually contains a minimum of 360 cards to accommodate an eight-player booster draft. The cards used in a Cube are usually unique so that no card appears more than once in a draft. Typically, the card pool is an amalgamation of powerful cards from throughout the history of Magic, although the card pool can be whatever theme is desired.\\n\\nThe Cube Draft format has been sanctioned by \"Magic Online\" in 2012, albeit for limited time runs. Cube Draft was first used as a format at the .\\n\\nSection::::Live Booster Draft.\\nLive Booster Draft is a booster draft variant where players draft during the game rather than before. First, players draft their seven card starting hands, then the game begins. Anytime a player would draw, they draft a card instead. This format is more skill-testing than Mini Master, the only other format that converts packs to games at 1 pack per player.\\n\\nSection::::Live Booster Draft League.\\nLive Booster Draft League is a series of five matches, composed of three LBDs and two \\'Sealed\\' matches built from the cards drafted after the second and third LBDs. This format provides enormous play value, granting 3 single-game matches and 2 best-of-three matches for just 3 packs per player.\\n\\nSection::::Back Draft.\\nBack Draft is a draft variant where each player tries to build the worst deck possible, because each player gives another player that deck to play in the tournament. To avoid mana problems, players choose what lands to add in the deck after they are \"backdrafted\". Scoring is usually done where a player gains a point each time the deck they play with wins and each time the deck they built loses.\\n\\nSection::::Reject Rare Draft.\\nReject Rare Draft is a format in which each player donates 45 rare cards (the same number as in 3 regular boosters) and then drafts as normal. The rares are \"donated\", as everyone takes home the deck they draft and no attempt is made to return the rares to the original owners, as all the rares donated must be able to be categorized as an \"unplayable\" rare occasionally printed by MTG for any number of reasons. Hence \"reject rare draft\". This variant was developed at Neutral Ground, a gaming store owned by Brian David-Marshall, a columnist for Wizards and noted commentator in the Magic world.\\n\\nSection::::Type 4.\\nIn the Type 4 or Limited Infinity format, players randomly draft a 45 card deck from a large card pool (similar to a cube draft) without knowing the cards included in their deck. Players get infinite mana but are only allowed 1 spell per turn (1 each turn, their own and 1 during each opponent\\'s turn). A starting hand is 5 cards.\\n\\nSection::::Casual Multiplayer.\\nThe majority of multiplayer formats are casual formats, with Two-Headed Giant being the only multiplayer format to ever be sanctioned. Many formats can be adapted for multiple players, however, some formats are designed specifically for play with multiple players. Multiplayer formats include:\\n\\nSection::::Free-For-All.\\nThe simplest format is the free-for-all, where players sit in a circle and vie with those around them to be the final surviving player. Sometimes restrictions are added on who can be attacked in large free-for-alls - e.g. a player can only attack players sitting next to them.\\n\\nSection::::Star.\\nStar (also called \"Pentagram\", \"Five-Point\", \"Rainbow\", \"Five-Player Star\", and \"Color War\") is a variant that involves exactly five players each playing one of the colors of \"Magic\". Artifacts and colorless cards are usually allowed, but not off-color cards, including multi-color or hybrid mana cards. Players sit in color wheel order (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green) and try to defeat the two diametrically opposed \"enemy\" players. A player wins when both enemy colors are eliminated from the game. It is possible to have multiple winners in an allied victory if two players meet the victory condition at the same time. (Example: Blue and White share the win when Green and Black have already been eliminated and Red is the last player to be eliminated. In this example, White and Blue have both reached the victory condition simultaneously.)\\n\\nAlternative variants of \"Star\" are where each player plays more than one color. For example, in a game of Star with allied color pair decks, the White/Blue deck would win once both Red decks (White and Blue\\'s mutual enemy) were defeated - Red/Black and Red/Green.\\n\\nSection::::Assassin.\\nIn the Assassin format, players are randomly assigned \"targets\" to defeat. Assassins and targets are selected by picking out pairs of cards (such as two forests two mountains two plains etc.) According to the number of players. Each player is dealt one type of card which is placed face up next to player. The other cards are shuffled and dealt face down (this is their target). Each player may only attack the target assigned to them. Players score points for delivering the finishing blow to their assigned target as well as for being the last survivor. Defeating another player grants you their \"contract\", and thus a new target to attack. If a player is dealt their matching card, then they are considered rogue and may target any player.\\n\\nSection::::Emperor.\\nIn the Emperor format, two teams, each generally composed of three players, play to ensure their central player (the \"Emperor\") outlasts the other. A team wins the game when the opposing Emperor has been eliminated, it does not matter if that team has any other players left on the team. Teams can either be pre determined or randomly decided. After teams have been selected Emperors are decided in the same fashion. Range of influence is a standard rule enforced upon each emperor during a game. It is widely debated what a fair range of influence is and should be discussed before the match. (Example: An Emperor with a ROI of 1 can only cast spells and abilities as far as 1 player to his left or right. A ROI of 2 enables targeting of 2 players left or right. This effectively allows emperors to use harmful spells on non emperor enemy players) Another rule worth noting is all creatures gain a tap ability that reads \"Target Teammate gains control of this creature.\" Summoning sickness affects use of this rule. If a player leaves the game for any reason all of their permanents leave the game as well regardless of who controls them.\\n\\nSection::::Variant \"Magic: The Gathering\" products.\\nWizards of the Coast have released a number of official products creating new, or supporting existing, casual formats. Below is a list of the formats these products were created for.\\n\\nSection::::Vanguard.\\nThis variant was designed specifically for social play. Each player has a special card that affects the game. These cards change the players\\' starting life total and cards in hand, and have additional effects as well. Vanguard initially began with special oversized Vanguard cards, released as part of various promotions. Only four sets of avatar cards were made before the product was discontinued. The cards featured depicted major characters from the storyline of Magic, including Gerrard Capashen, Karn and Squee. A new version of Vanguard was eventually added to Magic Online, with a player\\'s avatar filling the role of the oversized physical cards. Players are given a standard set of avatars and can receive more as entry and high-finishing prizes in release events. New avatars are regularly added as new sets of Magic cards are released, each depicting a card from the set. The wider availability online, combined with occasional tournaments, has made online Vanguard more of a success than its physical predecessor.\\n\\nOne recent addition to the regular Vanguard format is Momir Basic, which involves the Momir Avatar, which allows a player to discard a land card to get a random creature into play. All Momir Basic Decks are constructed entirely of basic land.\\n\\nSection::::Planar Magic.\\nIn September 2009, Wizards of the Coast released the Planechase product. The product was designed to allow players to play the new casual \\'Planar Magic\\' format. The format can be played with two or more players. Each player requires a traditional \"Magic\" deck and a \\'planar deck\\' of plane cards, players also need a \\'planar die\\'. The first player turns over a plane card from the top of their planar deck and that card affects the game as specified on the card. The current plane card only changes when the specific symbol on the planar dice is rolled.\\nIn 2012, Wizards announced that they would be making a new set of Planechase game packs. They were released on June 1, 2012.\\n\\nSection::::Archenemy.\\nIn June 2010, Wizards of the Coast released the product. The product allowed players to play a new multiplayer casual format designed by Wizards of the Coast. The format is designed for four players with one player taking the role of the Archenemy and the other three players creating a team to play against the Archenemy.\\n\\nEach player plays with a traditional Magic deck, however, the Archenemy also possess a \\'scheme deck\\' of 20 oversized cards. During the of the Archenemy\\'s turn they turn over a card from their Scheme deck and use its effect. The effects of scheme cards are usually powerful to allow the Archenemy a greater chance of defeating their three opponents. The Archenemy starts at 40 life while all other players start at the traditional 20 life. The Archenemy also always takes the first turn and draws a card at the beginning of this turn. The Archenemy\\'s opponents share a turn, as in the Two-Headed Giant format, however they play individually and cannot share resources.\\n\\nThe Archenemy wins the game by defeating each member of the opposing team, whilst the opposing team wins if they defeat the Archenemy.\\n\\nSection::::Commander.\\nThe Commander format, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), uses 100 card singleton decks (no duplicates except basic lands), a starting life total of 40, and features a \"Commander\" or \"General\". The Commander must be a legendary creature (with some exceptional cases, namely Planeswalkers with text that specifically states they can be your Commander), and all cards in the deck can only have mana symbols on them from the Commander\\'s colors. The Commander is not included in one\\'s library; it is visible to all players in the \"command\" zone and can be played as if it was in one\\'s hand. Whenever it would be put into a graveyard or exiled, the Commander\\'s owner may choose to put it back into the \"command\" zone instead. A Commander that is cast from the command zone costs an additional 2 generic mana for every other time that Commander has been cast from the command zone that game- this is referred to as \"Commander tax\" (for example, a 3 mana Commander would cost 3 mana the first time it is cast, 5 mana the 2nd time it is cast, 7 mana the 3rd time, etc). If a player takes 21 combat damage from any one commander, that player loses the game regardless of life total (a rule to bring games to an eventual halt and somewhat keep lifegain in check). The format has its own official banned list. Commander is usually a multiplayer format, although a special separate banned list exists for \"Duel Commander\" balanced for 1v1 matches on \"Magic Online\".\\n\\nThe format started as Elder Dragon Highlander and originally assumed that the five three-color Elder Dragons from the \"Legends\" set such as or were the only generals allowed. It proved one of the most popular variants of \"Magic\". Wizards of Coast decided to officially support the variant with the creation of the , preconstructed decks designed for playing the format that include both new cards and reprints. The first set of Commander decks were released in 2011, and decks are continuing to be released as of 2018.\\n\\nSection::::Brawl.\\nBrawl format is a variant format of the Commander developed by WotC staff Gerritt Turner. Which targeted at players who want to play commander but with a Standard Cardpool. Most rules are similar to commander, however, the deck size is 60 and any planeswalkers can also be a commander, life total is 25-30(depends on number of players) and the commander damage rule is not applied. The format used Standard-legal sets. It was supported by Magic Online quickly after its introduction.\\n\\nSection::::Captains.\\nCaptains format is a variant format of the Commander format developed by WotC. Most rules are similar to commander with the exception of a mana library and fewer card decks. \\nSection::::Other casual formats.\\nVarious alternative rules can be used to govern the construction of decks. Some of these variants have become so popular that unsanctioned tournaments have taken place at various Magic tournaments and gaming-oriented conventions such as Gen Con.\\nDice Roll Outcomes:\\nRoll 1: Discard a card (Skip your attack phase)\\nRoll 2: Skip your attack phase\\nRoll 3: Attack (if Able)\\nRoll 4: Attack (if Able)\\nRoll 5: Attack (if Able)\\nRoll 6: Draw a Loot Card (Then Attack)\\nLoot Decks are often pre-constructed (30 Cards Decks) to create different scenarios to change the state of the battlefield. Cards drawn from the Loot deck MUST be cast instantly and cannot be held. If a player rolls a dice and is able to attack, that player may NOT skip their attack phase.\\nPlayers must use 60 card decks.\\n\\nSection::::Retired formats.\\nSection::::Extended.\\nThe Extended format, formerly known as Type 1.x, was a format created in 1997 that contained more sets than Standard / Type II, but fewer sets than Vintage / Type 1. In 1997, it consisted of cards from \"The Dark\" and \"Revised\" and forward. By 2002, it changed to consist of the last six-to-eight years of sets, rotating every three years. In 2008, the format was changed to a flat last seven years regardless, with a rotation each year. In 2010, the format was changed again to consist of only the last four years of blocks and core sets. With each autumn set release, one year\\'s worth of sets rotate out of the format. Any additional sets released between rotations are automatically added to this format\\'s card pool. The new system was implemented to reduce the format\\'s card pool, with the intention that this would make the format more understandable and attractive to play. On July 22, 2013, Wizards of the Coast announced that the Extended format would be retired, with the final sanctioned events occurring on October 8, 2013.\\n\\nSection::::Block Constructed.\\nThe Block Constructed format uses only the cards from a single block of . \"Magic\" sets from to \"Khans of Tarkir\" have come in groups of three sets known as blocks. Block Constructed formats, and blocks themselves, usually take the name of the first set in the block. For example, the Ravnica Block Constructed format consists of \"\", \"Guildpact\", and \"Dissension\". Only cards that were printed in the sets in the appropriate block can be used in Block Constructed formats. The \"Lorwyn\" and \"Shadowmoor\" blocks were a minor exception, as they were two mini-blocks of two sets each that were combined to make the Lorwyn-Shadowmoor Block Constructed format.\\n\\nAfter 2015\\'s \"Battle for Zendikar\", blocks now consist of only two sets. Despite Wizards of the Coast still sanctioned Block Constructed event, no major events like Grand Prix or Pro Tour used that format since then, and has played the importance of the formats down. The format itself would be dropped in April 2018, when Block was no longer used in Standard sets.\\n\\nSection::::Prismatic.\\nIn Prismatic or 5-Color, players must build very large decks of at least 250 cards and accommodate a minimum number of cards of each color. This format was first developed by Kurt Hahn and several other players in the Milwaukee area in 1999â2000. 5-Color was managed by the 5CRC (5-Color Ruling Council), which while not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast or the DCI, organized tournaments, had its own list of banned and restricted cards, and had a world championship held at Gen Con. It also supported ante cards, an initial component of the rules for Magic that has since been deprecated. When \"Magic Online\" was under development, this format was requested by many users, and it was added as \"Prismatic\" with slight differences. An additional \"big deck\" mulligan was also standard online, allowing players to compensate for hands with too many or too few lands. However, the 5CRC eventually stopped sanctioning tournaments and changed leadership, and the \"Magic Online\" Prismatic format was discontinued due to lack of interest in 2015.\\n', 'title': 'Magic: The Gathering formats', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7431437'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7432664', 'text': 'Cushing, Minnesota\\n\\nCushing is an unincorporated community in Cushing Township, Morrison County, Minnesota, United States.

It was founded on January 25, 1816, by Saint EugÃ¨ne de Mazenod, a French priest born in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France on August 1, 1782. The congregation was given recognition by Pope Leo XII on February 17, 1826. The congregation is composed of priests and brothers usually living in community. Their traditional salutation is \"Laudetur Iesus Christus\" (\"Praised be Jesus Christ\"), to which the response is \"Et Maria Immaculata\" (\"And Mary Immaculate\"). In 2011, the congregation had approximately 4,400 members, including 580 in formation. In 2016, there were 3,924 members.\\n\\nSection::::History and charism.\\nThe Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate were founded in 1816 in Aix-en-Provence by Eugene de Mazenod. Born into the French minor nobility, his family were forced to flee to Italy during the French Revolution. There he experienced years of family instability, poverty, and danger. The family was forced to flee successively to Turin, Venice, Naples, and Palermo. Returning to France as a young man, he entered the Seminary of St. Sulpice and was ordained in 1811.\\n\\nOn January 25, 1816, Father Eugene de Mazenod and four companions came together to preach missions in ProvenÃ§al. The first members of this society were known as \"Missionaries of Provence\". They received the title of \"Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate\" and approbation as a congregation under simple vows in a Brief of Leo XII dated 17 February 1826.\\n\\nThe congregation was established to renew the Church in France after the French Revolution, primarily to(1) Revive the spirit of faith among rural and industrial populations by means of missions and retreats, in which devotion to the Sacred Heart and to Mary Immaculate is recommended as a supernatural means of regeneration. \"He hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor,\" has been adopted as the device of the congregation. (2) Care of young men\\'s societies, Catholic clubs. (3) Formation of clergy in seminaries.\\n\\nHowever, the work of the congregation soon developed and the charism of the Oblates is that theyare not specialised, except in facing urgent needs. ...It was enough for bishops to come to our Founder and say to him: \"I do not have anybody\" for him to act, re-examine his manpower, cut personnel here and there, and release 2 or 3 men for these new needs. And that continues today still. You see, it is a question of passion, of missionary concern.\\n\\nThe ancient sanctuary of St. Martin of Tours was re-excavated and revived by Oblate Fathers under Cardinal Guibert in 1862.\\n\\nSection::::Vows.\\nAs members of a religious congregation, the Missionaries Oblates of Mary Immaculate embrace the evangelical counsels, taking the three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity, abstaining from sexual activity, is intended to make the religious totally available for religious service.\\n\\nSection::::Religious formation.\\nThe congregationâs Rule of 1853 makes a statement which still applies: \"Whoever wishes to become one of us must have an ardent desire for his own perfection, and be enflamed with the love for Our Lord Jesus Christ and his Church and a burning zeal for the salvation of souls.\"\\n\\nIn the initial stages, those interested in joining the congregation have several meetings with an OMI priest, usually with visits to a community. Young adults aged 18 and over meet regularly to share their experiences of God and what God may be calling them to become. During this time the members of the congregation share what it is like to be a priest or religious brother. Those who are enquiring about entering the congregation are strongly encouraged to attend Mass as often as possible, to read the Sacred Scriptures especially the Gospel accounts, and to regularly spend time in prayer in order to better discern their vocation.\\n\\nSection::::Postulancy/Pre-novitiate.\\nThis is a 2-4 year-long experience of living in an OMI community, sharing in many aspects of the life of the congregation. During this time the postulants participate in the prayer life of a community, share more deeply with others, and become involved in one or more of the congregationâs apostolates. Essentially, it is an extended period of discernment for the postulants and an opportunity for the congregation to assess the strengths of the candidates and possible areas requiring growth. For those straight out of high school it is possible, in some provinces, to begin working on an undergraduate degree.\\n\\nSection::::Novitiate.\\nNext follows the novitiate which is the time for preparing to take the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then âthat the novices better understand their divine vocation and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.â Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth.\\n\\nA simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Congregation for: âBy religious profession, members assume the observance of the three evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the rights and duties defined by law.â\\n\\nSection::::Post-novitiate/Scholasticate.\\nAfter the novitiate, the new members of the congregation continue their studies. In the Philippines this normally involves a 4-year theology degree, followed by a missionary year abroad, although a student may make a request to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. In Canada, studies are undertaken at Saint Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario. Scholastics from four provinces in Southern Africa (Central, Lesotho, Natal, and Northern) study at the congregationâs scholasticate in the small town of Hilton in KwaZulu-Natal or at the international scholasticate in Rome.\\n\\nVows are renewed annually; after three years a member may request final vows. According to canon law, temporary vows may be renewed for a longer period but not exceeding nine years.\\n\\nSection::::Missions.\\nPope Pius XI (1857-1939) was so impressed by the courage of the Oblates that he referred to them as âspecialists in the most difficult missions of the Church.â Indeed, regarding their ministry the Oblates declare:We fulfill our task in healing the world by understanding its evolutionary character, by critically engaging its contemporary spirit, and by meeting its new needs in new ways.\\nWe seek out and immerse ourselves in the lives of the most abandoned in their many faces and voices, and struggle with those most affected by conflicts.\\nWith Gospel values we dialogue with peoples of different cultures, faiths, and religions, in the search for an integral transformation of society; we work with others to safeguard human dignity, nurture family, foster harmony, promote a culture of peace, and respond to the calls of justice and integrity of creation.\\n\\nThe Oblates work in parishes, Catholic schools, retreat centres, and among indigenous peoples, emphasizing issues of justice and peace. The Oblates are active on five continents. They maintain a presence at a number of Marian Shrines including Lourdes, Our Lady of Snows, in Belleville, Illinois, Notre-Dame de Pontmain, France, and in Loreto, Italy.\\n\\nIn the UK and Ireland the Oblates work through parishes and Centres of Mission in London, Edinburgh, Anglesey and Dublin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=743721', 'cat_id': '743721', 'cat_title': 'Animal_sportspeople_by_Canadian_province_or_territory', 'cat_pages': '1', 'cat_subcats': '1', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'DQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7440911', 'text': 'Oddernes\\n\\nOddernes is a borough in the municipality of Kristiansand in Vest-Agder county, Norway. The borough covers eastern Kristiansand on the east side of the Topdalsfjorden and the Varodd Bridge. The borough includes the former municipalities of Randesund and Tveit. There was a municipality of Oddernes from 1838 until 1965, but its boundaries were very different from those of the present-day borough.\\n\\nSection::::Name.\\nThe borough (originally the parish) is named after the old \"OddernÃ¦s\" farm (Old Norse: \"Otruness\").

This part of Randesund consisst of typical Norwegian neighborhoods, but with a bit larger houses and has been criticized as an upper-middle-class neighborhood, especially Dvergsnes. Aside from the suburban areas in TÃ¸mmerstÃ¸, Randesund is mostly agricultural as one approaches Lillesand. Randesund has 2,000 people, of whom 7% come from a non-Norwegian background, the lowest percentagein Kristiansand and second to last on the list of most populated immigrant places in Kristiansand after Gimlekollen and before FlekkerÃ¸y.\\n\\nSÃ¸m mostly consists of neighborhoods from the 1970s. SÃ¸m only has 10% non-Norwegian citizens and is one of the areas in Kristiansand with the lowest lowest percentage of immigrants, despite being the most populated part of Oddernes with 9,000 people. SÃ¸m is a typical urban neighborhood of a city.\\n\\nHÃ¥nes also mostly consist of neighborhoods. Some of Norway\\'s most expensive properties were sold on HÃ¥nestangen. Other than that, HÃ¥nes has a wide range of apartment buildings and typical Norwegian neighborhoods. HÃ¥nes has a population of 4,000 of whom 18% come from a non-Norwegian background, meaning HÃ¥nes is the place in Oddernes with most immigrants, and the sixth most popular place for immigrants in Kristiansand after Tinnheia.\\n\\nTveit is the largest part of the borough by area, but it also has the smallest population of only about 1,000 people. Tveit is home to most of the farms in Kristiansand and only a few residential neighborhoods like Hamresanden, Brattvollsheia, and Solsletta.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Oddernes', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7440911'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'DgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7442421', 'text': '3204 Lindgren\\n\\n3204 Lindgren, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter.

Organized broadcasting began in the U.S. in the early 1920s on the AM band â FM and television did not exist yet. Initially most broadcasting stations were assigned three-letter calls; however, a switch was made in April 1922 to primarily four-letter calls, after the number of stations had increased into the hundreds. For a few years thereafter a small number of new three-letter calls continued to be issued. Although most of the original three-letter calls were randomly assigned, these later calls were often specially requested to match station slogans. The last new three-letter call was assigned to station WIS (now WVOC) in Columbia, South Carolina on January 23, 1930. Since then, three-letter calls have only been assigned to stations, including FM and TV, which are historically related to an AM station that was originally issued that call sign.\\n\\nThis review only includes FCC-licensed stations. Not included are unlicensed operations, such as carrier current, cable TV, and Internet stations â for example, San Diego State University\\'s \"KCR\" â which have adopted call-letter-like identifiers that are not officially issued by the FCC. Also not included are stations which use, as slogans, three-letter truncations of their official four-letter call signs; for example, the full call sign for radio station \"KOH\" in Reno, Nevada is actually KKOH. In addition, stations which formerly had three letters but have since changed (such as Albuquerque, New Mexico\\'s KKOB, formerly KOB) are not listed.\\n\\nAs of March 1, 2019, there are a total of 102 AM, FM and TV stations in the United States that are assigned three-letter call signs. This is divided between only 68 different three-letter calls, because in many cases the same call sign is used by more than one station, although a given call sign is never assigned to more than one AM, FM or TV station. These 68 different three-letter call signs are currently grouped as follows:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Assignments.\\nListed below are all the assignments as of March 1, 2019:\\n\\nSection::::FM radio (27 stations).\\nIn cases where an AM station exists with the same \"base\" call letters as an FM station, the FM station is required to include an \"-FM\" suffix as part of its call sign. If no AM station is currently using the same base call sign, then the \"-FM\" suffix is optional.\\nSection::::Television (21 stations).\\nAs with FM stations, if an AM station currently exists with the same \"base\" call, a TV station must include a suffix to differentiate itself, but this suffix is optional if no AM station currently exists. TV stations may select either \"-TV\" or \"-DT\" as their suffix.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'List of three-letter broadcast callsigns in the United States', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744379', 'cat_id': '744379', 'cat_title': 'R.E.M._video_albums', 'cat_pages': '16', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7445309', 'text': 'Cox Sports\\n\\nCox Sports was a regional sports network that served the United States New England region until 2012.

The college offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and comprises five schools: the School of Business and Technology, the School of Health Sciences, the School of Liberal Arts, the School of Nursing, and the School of Public Service.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nExcelsior College was founded in 1971 by the New York State Board of Regents as its external degree program, known as The Regents External Degree Program (REX). The initial development of the program was funded by major grants from the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. Known as Regents College from 1984 until 1998, it operated as a program of the Board of Regents (which also served as its board of trustees). In April 1998, the Board of Regents granted the school an absolute charter to operate as a private, nonprofit, independent institution. On January 1, 2001, Regents College, required to change its name under the terms of the separation, became Excelsior College (\"Excelsior\" means \"ever upward\" in Latin; it is also the motto of New York).\\n\\nExcelsior College has more than 36,000 students enrolled in a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\\n\\nSection::::Accreditation.\\nThe college is regionally accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Its nursing programs are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, Inc. (ACEN), formerly known as the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission. The School of Nursing has twice been designated a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education by the National League for Nursing. Its baccalaureate degree programs in electrical engineering technology and nuclear engineering technology are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc.The bachelor\\'s degree programs in accounting (NYS CPA Track) and business are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE). The Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program has been accepted into full membership by the Association of Graduate Liberal Studies Programs (AGLSP).\\n\\nSection::::Academics.\\nExcelsior College is exceptionally liberal in accepting transfer credit from other institutions. Essentially, any credit from a regionally accredited institution will be accepted, if the course(s) falls within one of Excelsior\\'s degree programs. In fact Excelsior, then Regents College, was founded in part precisely to address this question (the non-transferability of credit, leading to uncompleted degrees). The college has recently added time limits: transfer credit will not be accepted if it is more than 5, 7, 10, or 20 years (depending on the specific degree program) prior to the date of enrollment. Even with these restrictions, this is a more liberal policy than most other colleges.\\n\\nExcelsior College is well known for its flexible, non-resident degree programs.\\n\\nSources of college credit that can be used towards an Excelsior College degree program, and to which advisors will refer an Excelsior student, include Excelsior College distance learning courses, courses from other regionally accredited institutions, college-level subject-matter examinations (including CLEP exams, and DSST/DANTES exams), non-collegiate training (including corporate, governmental, and military training) that has been evaluated for college-level credit by the American Council on Education (ACE), and assessments of prior learning portfolios. Unlike most colleges, Excelsior College sets no limitations on the amount of allowable transfer credit.\\n\\nExcelsior College also offers Excelsior College Examinations (ECE) which are comparable to CLEP and DSST exams and are accepted as a source of credits by many colleges in the United States.\\n\\nExcelsior College is a member of the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC) Consortium of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. SOC institutions are dedicated to helping servicemembers and their families earn college degrees. Military students can take courses in their off-duty hours at or near military installations in the United States, overseas, and on navy ships. Additionally, Excelsior College has repeatedly been nominated as a top military-friendly school by multiple organizations.\\n\\nExcelsior College is one of several regionally accredited colleges operating on a model similar to Thomas Edison State College in New Jersey and Charter Oak State College in Connecticut.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Excelsior College', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745187', 'cat_id': '745187', 'cat_title': 'ACC_articles_by_quality', 'cat_pages': '22', 'cat_subcats': '20', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7451913', 'text': \"Mineral redox buffer\\n\\nIn geology, a redox buffer is an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature. Knowledge of the redox conditions (or equivalently, oxygen fugacities) at which a rock forms and evolves can be important for interpreting the rock history. Iron, sulfur, and manganese are three of the relatively abundant elements in the Earth's crust that occur in more than one oxidation state. For instance, iron, the fourth most abundant element in the crust, exists as native iron, ferrous iron (Fe), and ferric iron (Fe). The redox state of a rock affects the relative proportions of the oxidation states of these elements and hence may determine both the minerals present and their compositions. If a rock contains pure minerals that constitute a redox buffer, then the oxygen fugacity of equilibration is defined by one of the curves in the accompanying fugacity-temperature diagram. For other rocks with suitable minerals, oxygen fugacities can be calculated, and the redox conditions can be obtained by comparison to the fugacity-temperature diagram.\\n\\nSection::::Common redox buffers and mineralogy.\\nCommon redox buffers\\n\\nRedox buffers were developed in part to control oxygen fugacities in laboratory experiments to investigate mineral stabilities and rock histories. Each of the curves plotted in the fugacity-temperature diagram is for an oxidation reaction occurring in a buffer. These redox buffers are listed here in order of decreasing oxygen fugacity at a given temperatureâin other words, from more oxidizing to more reducing conditions in the plotted temperature range. As long as all the pure minerals (or compounds) are present in a buffer assemblage, the oxidizing conditions are fixed on the curve for that buffer. Pressure has only a minor influence on these buffer curves for conditions in the Earth's crust.\\n\\nMH magnetite-hematite\\n\\n4 FeO + O = 6 FeO\\n\\nNiNiO nickel-nickel oxide\\n\\n2 Ni + O = 2 NiO\\n\\nFMQ fayalite-magnetite-quartz\\n\\n3 FeSiO + O = 2 FeO + 3 SiO\\n\\nWM wustite-magnetite\\n\\n3 FeO + O ~ FeO\\n\\nIW iron-wustite\\n\\n2(1-x) Fe + O = 2 FeO\\n\\nQIF quartz-iron-fayalite\\n\\n2 Fe + SiO + O = FeSiO\\n\\nSection::::Minerals, rock types, and characteristic buffers.\\nSection::::Mineralogy and correlations with redox buffer.\\nThe ratio of Fe to Fe within a rock determines, in part, the silicate mineral and oxide mineral assemblage of the rock. Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. For instance, at redox conditions more oxidizing than the MH (magnetite-hematite) buffer, at least much of the iron is likely to be present as Fe and hematite is a likely mineral in iron-bearing rocks. Iron may only enter minerals such as olivine if it is present as Fe; Fe cannot enter the lattice of fayalite olivine. Elements in olivine such as magnesium, however, stabilize olivine containing Fe to conditions more oxidizing than those required for fayalite stability. Solid solution between magnetite and the titanium-bearing endmember, ulvospinel, enlarges the stability field of magnetite. Likewise, at conditions more reducing than the IW (iron-wustite) buffer, minerals such as pyroxene can still contain Fe. The redox buffers therefore are only approximate guides to the proportions of Fe and Fe in minerals and rocks.\\n\\nSection::::Igneous rocks.\\nTerrestrial igneous rocks commonly record crystallization at oxygen fugacities more oxidizing than the WM (wÃ¼stite-magnetite) buffer and more reduced than a log unit or so above the nickel-nickel oxide (NiNiO) buffer. Their oxidizing conditions thus are not far from those of the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) redox buffer. Nonetheless, there are systematic differences that correlate with tectonic setting. Igneous rock emplaced and erupted in island arcs typically record oxygen fugacities 1 or more log units more oxidizing than those of the NiNiO buffer. In contrast, basalt and gabbro in non-arc settings typically record oxygen fugacities from about those of the FMQ buffer to a log unit or so more reducing than that buffer.\\n\\nSection::::Sedimentary rocks.\\nOxidizing conditions are common in some environments of deposition and diagenesis of sedimentary rocks. The fugacity of oxygen at the MH buffer (magnetite-hematite) is only about 10 at 25\\xa0Â°C, but it is about 0.2 atmospheres in the Earth's atmosphere, so some sedimentary environments are far more oxidizing than those in magmas. Other sedimentary environments, such as the environments for formation of black shale, are relatively reducing.\\n\\nSection::::Metamorphic rocks.\\nOxygen fugacities during metamorphism extend to higher values than those in magmatic environments, because of the more oxidizing compositions inherited from some sedimentary rocks. Nearly pure hematite is present in some metamorphosed banded iron formations. In contrast, native nickel-iron is present in some serpentinites.\\n\\nSection::::Extraterrestrial rocks.\\nWithin meteorites, the iron-wÃ¼stite redox buffer may be more appropriate for describing the oxygen fugacity of these extraterrestrial systems.\\n\\nSection::::Redox effects and sulfur.\\nSulfide minerals such as pyrite (FeS) and pyrrhotite (FeS) occur in many ore deposits. Pyrite and its polymorph marcasite also are important in many coal deposits and shales. These sulfide minerals form in environments more reducing than that of the Earth's surface. When in contact with oxidizing surface waters, sulfides react: sulfate (SO) forms, and the water becomes acidic and charged with a variety of elements, some potentially toxic. Consequences can be environmentally harmful, as discussed in the entry for acid mine drainage.\\n\\nSulfur oxidation to sulfate or sulfur dioxide also is important in generating sulfur-rich volcanic eruptions, like those of Pinatubo in 1991 and El Chichon in 1982. These eruptions contributed unusually large quantities of sulfur dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere, with consequent effects on atmospheric quality and on climate. The magmas were unusually oxidizing, almost two log units more so than the NiNiO buffer. The calcium sulfate, anhydrite, was present as phenocrysts in the erupted tephra. In contrast, sulfides contain most of the sulfur in magmas more reducing than the FMQ buffer.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Mineral redox buffer', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7451913'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7455522', 'text': 'Klobuchar\\n\\nKlobuchar may refer to:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Klobuchar', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7455522'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7455840', 'text': 'Benjamin Franklin Perry\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin Perry (November 20, 1805December 3, 1886) was the 72nd Governor of South Carolina, appointed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson in 1865 after the end of the American Civil War.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nPerry was born in Pickens District and educated at preparatory schools in Asheville, North Carolina. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1827, but pursued journalism and became the editor of the \"Greenville Mountaineer\" in 1832. The paper was adamantly against nullification and Perry was able to parlay his influence by being elected as a delegate to both the Union Convention and the Nullification Convention. Turner Bynum, who was editor of the pro-Calhoun \"Greenville Sentinel\" newspaper, met Perry in a duel. The duel was staged on an island in the Tugaloo River near Hatton\\'s Ford on August 17, 1832. Perry fatally wounded Bynum who died that night.\\n\\nSection::::Political career.\\nIn 1836, Perry was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served for six years until 1842, he had lost to Warren R. Davis in 1834. He gained election to the South Carolina Senate in 1844, but returned to the House of Representatives in 1849 and remained a member until 1860. As the secession movement was sweeping the state in the years prior to the Civil War, Perry founded \"The Southern Patriot\" in 1851 to counter and spread a unionist message. Even though Perry was adamantly against secession, he embraced the state when it did secede and rallied the residents in the Upstate in favor of the Confederate cause. He was again elected to the House of Representatives in 1862 and served until being appointed as a Confederate States District Judge in 1864.\\n\\nOn June 30, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson appointed Perry as the provisional Governor of South Carolina, because of the strong unionist views he had held prior to the war. Perry was directed by the president to enroll voters and to lead the state in the writing of a new state constitution. The delegates at the constitutional convention largely followed Perry\\'s guidelines for the constitution, but they strayed by adopting the black codes to prevent black suffrage. President Johnson, as well as several leading statesmen of South Carolina, urged the granting of suffrage to blacks while also including a property qualification clause. A property qualification would essentially disenfranchise all blacks without giving the appearance of impropriety towards blacks and prevent the imposition of harsh terms by the Radical Republicans\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin Perry said in 1865, \"The African,\" \"has been in all ages, a savage or a slave. God created him inferior to the white man in form, color, and intellect, and no legislation or culture can make him his equal... His hair, his form and features will not compete with the caucasian race, and it is in vain to think of elevating him to the dignity of the white man. God created differences between the two races, and nothing can make him equal\".\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nUpon the completion of the constitution, elections were called and Perry sought election to the U.S. Senate. He was elected along with John Lawrence Manning, but the Radical Republicans in charge of Congress refused to seat them. In 1872, he unsuccessfully ran for the 4th congressional district House seat against Republican Alexander S. Wallace. His son, William Hayne Perry, did successfully gain election to the House and was a member from 1885 to 1891. Perry died in Greenville on December 3, 1886 and was interred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Benjamin Franklin Perry', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7455840'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7456881', 'text': 'Agios Spyridonas\\n\\nAgios Spyridonas (Greek meaning Saint Spyridon) may refer to the following places in Greece:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Agios Spyridonas', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7456881'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7457756', 'text': 'Louis-Pierre Norblin\\n\\nLouis Pierre Martin Norblin (2 December 1781, in Warsaw â 14 July 1854, in Connantre) was a French musician.

An offhore seismic survey in 1954 showed the field extended some miles to the southeast.

This Ruysch map was published and widely distributed in 1507.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nIn old documents Ruysch was sometimes called a Fleming or German, but he was likely born in Utrecht in the current Netherlands. It is thought (see the Beneventanus commentary below) that he accompanied John Cabot on his expedition to North America in 1497 and 1498, or, considering the prevalence of Portuguese names on his 1507 map, a Portuguese ship leaving from Bristol. Around 1505, Ruysch probably entered the Benedictine monastery of St. Martin in Cologne as a secular priest. Soon he left for Rome, where pope Julius II gave him a dispensation concerning his priestly occupation. He presumably made his world map there in 1507, appears on payrolls in 1508 and 1509 and seems to have specialized in decorative painting. He is thought to be the âFleming called Johnâ, a close friend of Raphael who at one point resided with him. It has been suggested that he assisted and advised Raphael on his 1509-1510 âAstronomiaâ and other frescoes in the Stanza della segnatura. Not long after, Ruysch went to work at the Portuguese court as cartographer and astronomer, presumably by recommendation of Julius II who was friends with Manuel I of Portugal. Later, he returned to the St. Martin monastery, suffering from consumption, but able to create a, now lost, astronomical wall painting illustrating the days, months (phases of the Moon), and constellations. He is said to have died at considerable age in 1533 at the monastery, where he had a room adjacent to the library.\\n\\nSection::::Age of discovery.\\nThere had been many voyages of discovery immediately before Ruysch created his map :\\n\\nAlthough there had been maps created after these voyages, such as Juan de la Cosaâs map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus\\' second voyage) and the Cantino world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely held and guarded as state secrets. Often a limited number of copies were made.\\n\\nSection::::Publicizing the shape of the world.\\nThis situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The Contarini-Rosselli map of 1506 (now in the British Library) and Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller\\'s map of the world and globe of 1507 were very influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. By contrast, Johannes Ruysch\\'s 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence.\\n\\nSection::::The Ruysch Map of 1507.\\nRuysch\\'s 1507 map of the world was included in the 1507 and 1508 southern editions of \"Ptolemy\\'s\" \"Geographia\", an atlas published in Rome. The editor of the 1507 edition of the Geographia was Evangelista Tosinus and the printer was Bernardinus Venetus de Vitalibus.\\n\\nThe Ruysch map uses Ptolemy\\'s first projection, a coniform projection, as does the Contarini-Rosselli map. Both document Christopher Columbus\\' discoveries as well as the discoveries of John Cabot, as well as including information from Portuguese sources and Marco Polo\\'s account of his travels. There are notes on his map that clearly were from Portuguese sources.\\n\\nNewfoundland is shown connected to Asia in the Ruysch map, as Cabot believed. The presence of codfish is noted on the Ruysch map in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.\\n\\nGreenland is shown connected to Newfoundland and Asia on Ruysch\\'s map, and not Europe as earlier maps had showed. Around the north pole, Ruysch drew islands, based on reports in the book \"Inventio Fortunata\" of the English friar Nicholas of Lynne. The island above Norway shows remarkable similarities to Svalbard, which would not be discovered until 1597 (by Willem Barents). Ruysch calls it \\'European Hyberborea\\' and a peninsula stretching out towards it is clearly marked with the church of \\'Sancti Odulfi\\', St Olaf\\'s church in VardÃ¸ on the Finnmark coast.\\n\\nRuysch\\'s map contains the discoveries the Portuguese had made along the African coast. Ruysch\\'s map shows Africa as a peninsula surrounded by water. The horn of Africa on Ruysch\\'s map is at approximately the correct latitude. Ruysch\\'s map shows India as a triangular peninsula with Ceylon in the correct proportion and position.\\n\\nRuysch\\'s map has details about Asia based on data gathered by travelers like Marco Polo, as well as Greco-Roman authorities. Unaware of the existence of the Pacific Ocean he, like Christopher Columbus, saw Central and North America as the eastern part of Asia. He accepted that \"Sipango\" [Japan] and \"Hispaniola\" [Haiti] were one and the same, a concept he expressed in the legend he inscribed on his world map: Marco Polo says that 1500 miles to the east of the port of ZAITON (Quanzhou) there is a very large island called SIPANGO whose inhabitants are idolaters: they have their own king and pay tribute to none. Here there is a great amount of gold and gems of all kinds. But as the islands discovered by Spanish ships occupy this place, we do not dare to put this island here, believing what the Spaniards call SPAGNOLA to be SIPANGO, for everything that is written of Sipango is found in Spagnola except for the idolatry.\\n\\nSection::::Map commentary.\\nThere was a map commentary also included in the 1508 edition, entitled and written by an Italian Celestinian monk named Marcus Beneventanus. Beneventanus, wrote in the commentary on the Ruysch map for the 1508 Ptolemy edition: \\n\\nCommentary:\\nThe church \"Sancti Odulfi\" shown on Ruysch\\'s map, is not the church in VardÃ¸, Finnmark, but the cathedral in Trondheim.

With a population of approximately 128,140 (December 2017), it is currently the capital of the Opole Voivodeship and, also the seat of Opole County. With its long history dating back to the 8th century, Opole is one of the oldest cities in Poland. It is also the smallest city in Poland to be the largest city in a voivodeship.\\n\\nThe origins of the first settlement are connected with the town being granted Magdeburg Rights in 1217 by Casimir I of Opole, the great-grandson of Polish Duke BolesÅaw III Wrymouth. During the Medieval Period and the Renaissance the city was known as a centre of commerce due to its position on the intersection of several main trade routes, which helped to generate steady profits from transit trade. The rapid development of the town was also caused by the establishment of a seat of regency in Opole in 1816. The first railway connection between Opole, Brzeg and WrocÅaw was opened in 1843 and the first manufacturing plants were constructed in 1859, which greatly contributed to the city\\'s regional significance.\\n\\nThe city\\'s extensive heritage entails almost all cultures of Central Europe including years of Polish, Bohemian, Prussian and German rule. Opole formally became part of Poland again in 1945 under the Potsdam Agreement. Many German Upper Silesians and Poles of German ancestry still reside in the Opole region; in the city itself, however, ethnic Germans today make up less than 3% of the population following the 1945-6 expulsions.\\n\\nToday there are four higher education establishments in the city: The Opole University, Opole University of Technology, a Medical College and the private Higher College of Management and Administration. The National Festival of Polish Song has been held here annually since 1963 and each year new regular events, fairs, shows and competitions take place.\\n\\nOpole is sometimes referred to as \"Polish Venice\", because of its picturesque Old Town and several canals and bridges connecting parts of the city.\\n\\nSection::::Name.\\nThe name \"\"Opole\"\" likely originated from the medieval Slavic term for a group of settlements.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::In Medieval Poland.\\nOpole\\'s history begins in the 8th century. At this time, according to the archeological excavations, the first Slavic settlement was founded on the OstrÃ³wek - the northern part of the Pasieka Island in the middle of the Oder river. In the early 10th century it developed into one of the main \"gords\" of the Slavic Opolanie tribe. \\n\\nAt the end of the century Silesia became part of Poland and was ruled by the Piast dynasty; the land of the pagan Opolanie was conquered by Duke Mieszko I in 992. From the 11th-12th centuries it was also a castellany. After the death of Duke WÅadysÅaw II the Exile, Silesia was divided in 1163 between two Piast lines- the WrocÅaw line in Lower Silesia and the Opole-RacibÃ³rz of Upper Silesia. Opole would become a duchy in 1172 and would share much in common with the Duchy of RacibÃ³rz, with which it was often combined. In 1281 Upper Silesia was divided further between the heirs of the dukes. The Duchy of Opole was temporarily reestablished in 1290.\\n\\nIn the early 13th century, Duke Casimir I of Opole decided to move the settlement from the Pasieka Island into the right shore of the Oder river (since the 17th century it is the old stream bed of Oder known as MÅynÃ³wka). All of the inhabitants had to be moved in order to make place for the castle that was eventually built in the place of the old city. Former inhabitants of OstrÃ³wek together with German merchants that immigrated here from the West, received first town rights probably as early as around 1217, although this date is disputed. Opole received German town law in 1254, which was expanded with Neumarkt law in 1327. Opole developed during the rule of duke Bolko I of Opole. In this time the castle was finally completed and new buildings, including the city walls and the Holy Cross Church, were constructed. \\n\\nAlong with most of Silesia, in 1327 the Duchy of Opole came under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Bohemia, itself part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1521 the Duchy of RacibÃ³rz (\"Ratibor\") was inherited by the Duchy of Opole, by then also known by its German equivalent - Oppeln. The second castle of Opole was probably founded in the 14th century by duke Vladislaus II, though some sources claim that it was originally a wooden stronghold of Opole\\'s castellan dating into 12th century.\\n\\nSection::::In the Habsburg Monarchy.\\nWith the death of King LudvÃ­k II of Bohemia at the Battle of MohÃ¡cs, Silesia was inherited by Ferdinand I, placing Opole under the sovereignty of the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria. The Habsburgs took control of the region in 1532 after the last Piast duke of Opole - Jan II the Good died. In those days the city was still mainly Polish-speaking (around 63%), with other nationalities represented mainly by Germans, Czechs and Jews. The last two dukes of Opole, Nicholas II and Janusz II the Good, did not master the German language.\\n\\nBeginning in 1532 the Habsburgs pawned the duchy to different rulers including several monarchs of Poland (see Dukes of Opole). With the abdication of King John II Casimir of Poland as the last Duke of Opole in 1668, the region passed to the direct control of the Habsburgs. At the beginning of the 18th century the German population of Opole was estimated at around 20%.\\n\\nSection::::In Prussian Silesia.\\nKing Frederick II of Prussia conquered most of Silesia from Austria in 1740 during the Silesian Wars; Prussian control was confirmed in the Peace of Breslau in 1742. During the Prussian rule the ethnic structure of the city began to change. In the early 20th century the number of Polish and bilingual citizens of Opole, according to the official German statistics, varied from only 25% to 31%. From 1816â1945 Opole was the capital of Regierungsbezirk Oppeln within Prussia. The city became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany in 1871.\\n\\nSection::::After World War I.\\nAfter the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I, a plebiscite was held on 20 March 1921 in Oppeln to determine if the city would be in the Weimar Republic or become part of the Second Polish Republic. 20,816 (94.7%) votes were cast for Germany, 1,098 (5.0%) for Poland, and 70 (0.3%) votes were declared invalid. Voter participation was 95.9%. Results of the plebiscite in the Oppeln-Land county were different, with 30% of population voting for Poland.\\n\\nOppeln was the administrative seat of the Province of Upper Silesia from 1919â1939. With the defeat of Poland in the invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II in 1939, formerly Polish Eastern Upper Silesia was re-added to the Province of Upper Silesia and Oppeln lost its status as provincial capital to Katowice (renamed Kattowitz).\\n\\nOn 15 February 1941 and 26 February 1941, two deportation transports with 2,003 Jewish men, women and children on board left Vienna Aspang Station for the ghetto which had been set up in Oppeln. By March 1941, 8,000 Jews were deported to Oppeln. From May 1941, 800 men capable of work were deployed as forced labourers in Deblin. The \"Liquidation\" of the Oppeln ghetto began in the spring 1942. A transport to Belzec extermination camp left on 31 March 1942 and deportations to Sobibor followed in May and October 1942. Of the 2,003 Viennese Jews, only twenty-eight are known to have survived.\\n\\nSection::::In modern Poland.\\nAfter the end of the Second World War in 1945, Oppeln was transferred from Germany to Poland according to the Potsdam Conference, and given its original Slavic name of Opole. Opole became part of the Katowice Voivodeship from 1946â1950, after which it became part of the Opole Voivodeship. Unlike other parts of the so-called Recovered Territories, Opole and the surrounding region\\'s indigenous population remained and was not forcibly expelled as elsewhere. Over 1 million Silesians who considered themselves Poles or were treated as such by the authorities due to their language and customs were allowed to stay after they were verified as Poles in a special verification process. It involved declaring Polish nationality and an oath of allegiance to the Polish nation.\\n\\nIn the later years however many of them left to West Germany to flee the communist Eastern Bloc (see Emigration from Poland to Germany after World War II). Today Opole, along with the surrounding region, is known as a centre of the German minority in Poland that recruits mainly from the descendants of the positively verified autochthons. In the city itself however only 2.46% of the inhabitants declared German nationality according to the last national census of 2002.\\n\\nOn January 1, 2017, Borki, Chmielowice, CzarnowÄsy, Krzanowice, SÅawice, Åwierkle, WinÃ³w, Wrzoski, Å»erkowice as well as parts of Brzezie, DobrzeÅ MaÅy and KarczÃ³w became a part of Opole, enlargening its population by about 9,500, and its area by over 5,300 ha, despite the protests of inhabitants.\\n\\nSection::::Historical population.\\nIn the early 20th century the number of Polish and bilingual citizens of Opole, according to the official German statistics, varied from 25 to 31%.\\n\\nÂ¹ First census of the city\\n\\nÂ² 8,320 German nationality (93.7%) and 557 Polish nationality (6.3%)\\n\\nÂ³ 80% German-speaking, 16% Polish-speaking, and 4% bilingual Polish-German-speaking\\n\\nSection::::German minority.\\nAlongside German and Polish, many citizens of Opole-Oppeln before 1945 used a strongly German-influenced Silesian dialect (sometimes called \"wasserpolnisch\" or \"wasserpolak\"). Because of this, the post-war Polish state administration after the annexation of Silesia in 1945 did not initiate a general expulsion of all former inhabitants of Opole, as was done in Lower Silesia, for instance, where the population almost exclusively spoke the German language. Because they were considered \"autochthonous\" (Polish), the Wasserpolak-speakers instead received the right to remain in their homeland after declaring themselves as Poles. Some German speakers took advantage of this decision, allowing them to remain in their Oppeln, even when they considered themselves to be of German nationality. The city surroundings currently contain the largest German and Upper Silesian minorities in Poland. However, Opole itself is only 2.46% German. (See also Germans of Poland.)\\n\\nSection::::Main sights.\\nOpole hosts the annual National Festival of Polish Song. The city is also known for its 10th-century Church of St. Adalbert and the 14th-century Church of the Holy Cross. There is a zoo, the OgrÃ³d Zoologiczny w Opolu.\\n\\nStructures and buildings\\n\\nMuseums\\n\\nCemeteries\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nOpole is one of the warmest cities in Poland.

The French building materials company Lafarge is also active in the area, having its roofing division, Lafarge Roofing, together with its German subsidiary Schiedel (chimney manufacturing) based in Opole.\\n\\nOther companies in the city include: the German valve manufacturer Kludi; the German men\\'s fashion manufacturer Ahlers and the American automotive manufacturer Tower Automative. As is the case with the entire Opole Voivodeship, there is a strong presence of food industry services in the city. The largest companies in the food sector include: Zott, the Dutch baby food and nutrition company Nutricia, part of the Danone food-products corporation.\\n\\nOpole has branches of all major banks, including: PKO, Pekao, Deutsche Bank and Raiffeisen Zentralbank.\\n\\nThe retail sector in Opole includes major Metro AG brand stores: Metro Cash and Carry and Media-Saturn-Holding, as well as Real. The city has a plethora of other major supermarket chains, namely: the Polish supermarket chains Biedronka, Lidl, Aldi and Netto. Other major brand stores include the shoe retailer Deichmann and Rossmann drugstores.\\n\\nFurthermore, the city has three major shopping centres. The Solaris Center, with a total of 86 shops, opened in May 2009 and is located in the centre of MikoÅaj Kopernik Square. In the city\\'s suburbs, by WrocÅawska Street (\"ul. WrocÅawska\") is the location of Karolinka Shopping Centre (\"Centrum Handlowe Karolinka\"). The shopping centre, which opened in September 2008, has a total area of 38,000 mÂ², with a total of 99 stores, including fashion, hardware and electronics stores. To the east of the city, by the National Road 46, is the smallest of the three shopping centres, Turawa Park, with a total of 50 stores. Other shopping centres include \"Galeria Opolanin\", built between 1974 and 1981 and upon its completion, was the largest shopping centre in Poland.\\n\\n\\nSection::::International relations.\\nSection::::Twin towns - Sister cities.\\nOpole is twinned with:\\n\\n\\n<br>\\n', 'title': 'Opole', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74610', 'cat_id': '74610', 'cat_title': 'British_philanthropists', 'cat_pages': '282', 'cat_subcats': '7', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '746201', 'text': 'Chanoch\\n\\nChanoch may refer to:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Chanoch', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=746201'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '746540', 'text': \"Mega Records\\n\\nMega Records was a Nashville, Tennessee-based music label founded in 1970 by former RCA Records executive Brad McCuen along with Henry Pratt.

After the 1911 revolution he attended Guangxi Military Cadre Training School in Guilin along with Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren. Later he rose to command the Model Battalion, a modern professional military formation equipped with machine guns.\\n\\nIn the confused power struggles following the Ao-Gui Wars, local military figures began to carve out territory in Guangxi and dominate it. In the southwest were the opium trails from both Yunnan and Guizhou that ran through Baise and then down the river to Nanning, from whence opium usually went out through Wuzhou, where the trade was financed. \\nDuring the Ao-Gui wars Huang, then the commander of the Model Battalion, attempted to stay neutral and relocated to Baise in the far northwest. By stages he came to control Baise, and with it the opium trade. Later he expanded his control to Wuzhou, thus locking up the portals through which opium both entered and left Guangxi. By the spring of 1924 the new Guangxi Clique had formed and created the Guangxi Pacification Army. Li Zongren was the Commander-in-Chief, Huang the deputy Commander and Bai Chongxi the Chief of Staff. By August they had defeated and driven former ruler Lu Rongting and other contenders out of the province and Huang became the civil governor of Guangxi from 1924-29. He was also interior and transportation minister in the National Government of Chiang Kai-shek after 1927.\\n\\nDuring the Kumul Rebellion Chiang Kai-shek was ready to send Huang and his expeditionary force, which he assembled to assist Muslim Gen. Ma Zhongying against Sheng Shicai, but when Chiang heard about the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang, he decided to withdraw to avoid an international incident if his troops directly engaged the Soviets, leaving Ma alone without reinforcements to fight the Red Army.\\n\\nHuang became chairman of the government of Zhejiang from 1934â35 and Hubei from 1936-37. Again from 1937-46 he became chairman of the government of Zhejiang and commander of the 15th Army of the National Revolutionary Army. During World War II he was named deputy commander-in-chief of the 2nd War Zone. After the war he was named head of the Supervisory Committee and elected member of the Legislative Yuan (parliament).\\n\\nDuring the Chinese Civil War peace talks in March 1949, he was one of the Kuomintang delegates. He and Zhang Zhizhong agreed to accept the cease-fire conditions submitted by the Communist Party. When the Kuomintang leadership turned them down later, Huang fled to Hong Kong and declared his revolt from the KMT and joined the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in September 1949.\\n\\nAfter the founding of the People\\'s Republic, Huang was elected a member of the State Council, National People\\'s Congress, and CPPCC. He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. During the Anti-Rightist Movement, Huang was labeled a rightist. Later, during the Cultural Revolution, he was again determined to be a \"rightist.\" Unable to stand the persecution of the Red Guards, he committed suicide at home on August 31, 1966, in Beijing.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Huang Shaohong', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7471019'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '747171', 'text': 'Barrancabermeja\\n\\nBarrancabermeja is a city in Colombia, located on the shore of the Magdalena River, in the western part of the department of Santander.

Although he lived in New York City for much of his adult career, Ryan was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond in the decades before the Great Depression. In addition to paying for schools, hospitals and other charitable works, Ryan\\'s donations paid for the construction of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia. Ryan also made significant donations to Catholic institutions in New York City and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nSection::::Early days.\\nThomas Fortune Ryan was born on October 17, 1851, near Lovingston, Virginia, the county seat of Nelson County. Despite a myth promulgated by Cleveland Amory regarding his background, Ryan was neither orphaned nor penniless as a youth, nor did his ancestors flee the Potato Famine as did many who worked on or rode his streetcars. Rural Virginia where Ryan grew up attracted few of those emigrants. Ryan\\'s father was a tailor and managed a small hotel. He traced his ancestry to Protestant Anglo-Irish settlers who came to North America in the seventeenth century.\\n\\nRyan\\'s mother, Lucinda Fortune Ryan, died in 1856 when he was five years old. His father remarried and moved to Tennessee two years later. Ryan was raised as a Protestant by his mother\\'s extended family in Lovingston, south of Charlottesville in Virginia\\'s Piedmont. Local Baptist ministers taught the youth to read and write, but Ryan did not attend college. Before the American Civil War, Ryan and his younger brother owned three slaves.\\n\\nSection::::Conversion.\\nAged 17, three years after the war ended, Ryan fled the lack of economic opportunity for post-war Virginia and so moved to the nearest big city, Baltimore, Maryland with $100 in his pocket. En route, Ryan converted to Catholicism, purportedly after long discussions with the conductor.\\n\\nIn Baltimore, John S. Barry, a prosperous dry goods merchant and Catholic, hired young Ryan. By 1872, Barry helped Ryan secure a brokerage assistant position on Wall Street where he would be tutored by William Collins Whitney.\\n\\nSection::::Fortune building.\\nRyan opened a brokerage firm with two partners, Lee, Ryan & Warren, the following year.\\n\\nIn 1873 Ryan married his former boss\\'s daughter, Ida Mary Barry, whose family were devout Roman Catholics. They had seven children. In 1874, his firm purchased Ryan a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. At the same time, Ryan became active in politics, especially the Tammany Hall machine that controlled much of the city\\'s operations, giving him political and industrial contacts across the city.\\n\\nRyan\\'s fortune began in public transit. In 1883, he founded the New York Cable Railroad and bid on the proposed route from lower Manhattan to Midtown. After numerous legal and financial problems, in 1886 Ryan reorganized his cable railroad as the Metropolitan Traction Company. By 1893, construction of Ryan\\'s rail system was underway on Broadway. Metropolitan continually acquired additional lines so that by 1900 it controlled 3,000 cars and 300 miles of track the majority of New Yorkâs streetcar operations. \\n\\nRyan\\'s most profitable investment was tobacco. Having invested in its stocks throughout the 1890s, Ryan joined tobacco assets in 1898, forming The Union Tobacco Company. Shortly thereafter, he merged Union Tobacco with his greatest competitor, James Duke of North Carolina, forming the American Tobacco Company. Together Ryan and Duke developed the British-American Tobacco Company to protect American tobacco trade in Europe. Upon his death, Ryan also had major holdings in R. J. Reynolds and Liggett & Myers.\\n\\nIn 1905, amid public outcry, Ryan purchased the $400-million-strong Equitable Life Assurance Society, a major factor in the insurance industry. Although Ryan strove to make Equitable more responsive to its policy holders, public reaction to his purchase was overwhelmingly negative. His reputation for cutthroat business dealings in the streetcar and subway businesses made the public distrustful. In 1909, Ryan sold his Equitable stock. Also in 1905, Ryan\\'s Metropolitan street car system was threatened by New Yorkâs increasingly popular subway system. He merged Metropolitan with August Belmont Jr.\\'s Interborough Rapid Transit Company. But the joint companyâs finances were shaky, and Ryan pulled out. Meanwhile, some $35 million that Ryan had raised in a bond issue were misappropriated. Ryan was investigated for corruption in 1908, but the grand jury brought no charges. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Ryan was making fortunes with coal mines, banks, public utilities and railroads. He owned Royal Typewriter and backed the maker of the Thompson submachine gun. At one time Ryan had controlling interest in 30 corporations.\\n\\nSection::::Philanthropy.\\nAs her husband\\'s wealth grew exponentially, Ida Barry Ryan began making large benefactions to Catholic charitable organizations in New York, Virginia, and across the country. The Ryans funded churches, convents and hospitals in Manhattan, including the architecturally important St. Jean Baptiste Catholic Church on the Upper East Side. In Washington, D.C., they paid for a gymnasium and dormitory at the Jesuit-founded Georgetown University.\\n\\nIn 1901, the Ryans funded the construction of Sacred Heart Church and Sacred Heart School on Perry Street in Manchester, Virginia (now part of Richmond). In the same year, the Ryans donated $250,000 to build a new cathedral in Richmond, and soon doubled that donation to ensure that the interior would be of the highest workmanship. The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, whose cornerstone was laid by the apostolic delegate on June 4, 1903, was dedicated by the same nuncio on November 29, 1906, and remains one of the metropolitan area\\'s architectural landmarks. Other Ryan gifts in Virginia included the Cathedral High and the Cathedral Primary schools in Richmond.\\n\\nIn October 1903, Ryan and his wife donated a two-story brick and steam heated building near the Newport News Shipyard to the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth so they could start a Catholic girls school (to be named St. Vincent\\'s de Paul School and later renamed Peninsula Catholic High School). In June 1904, they donated a new building for the Sisters and their 104 students in their charge. The Ryans also financed construction of Catholic churches in Harrisonburg and Charlottesville.\\n\\nPope Pius X recognized the couple\\'s generosity by naming him to the papal nobility and giving Ida Ryan the cross \"Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice\" for her work in the Diocese. The couple\\'s lifetime contributions to Catholic charities around the country totalled $20 million. However, Mrs. Ryan refused to allow any funds to be used for \"colored work\" (including schools and hospitals for Virginia\\'s freed blacks, despite diocescan missionary priorities of the time).\\n\\nThe Ryans\\' philanthropy also extended to Southern history, the fine arts and exploration. Ryan financed and selected Charles Hoffbauer to create a series of paintings, \"The Four Seasons of the Confederacy\", commissioned for a major gallery in what is now the Virginia Historical Society. For Jamestown\\'s 300th anniversary in 1907, Ryan donated a collection of portraits of key players in Virginia\\'s settlement. Thomas Ryan also helped finance Virginia explorer Richard E. Byrd\\'s flight to the South Pole. \\n\\nIn 1887, the Ryans bought the Groesbeck mansion near Suffern, New York, a major town on the Erie Railroad, and rebuilt it into a summer home they called \"Montebello\". During the three decades before her death, Ida Barry Ryan funded the construction of the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, as well as the Good Samaritan Hospital.\\n\\nSection::::Later years.\\nRyan announced his intention to retire in 1912. Re-establishing his roots in his native state of Virginia, he had since 1901 maintained \"Oak Ridge\" in Nelson County, formerly the estate of tobacco trader William Rives and later of former Confederate and U.S. Congressman William Porcher Miles. Ryan also became as a Virginia delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1912, which selected fellow Virginian Woodrow Wilson as the party\\'s presidential candidate.\\n\\nIn 1916, Thomas Fortune Ryan was also the principal financial backer of John T. Thompsons Auto-Ordnance Company for the purpose of developing his \"auto rifle\" and the Thompson Submachine-Gun.\\n\\nOn October 17, 1917, on his 66th birthday, his wife Ida died from heart disease. Twelve days later the widower Ryan married widow Mary Townsend Lord Cuyler. The resulting scandal did not deter Belgian Cardinal Desire-Joseph Mercier from accepting Ryan\\'s proffered private railway car in 1919, which he used in touring the United States and accepting honorary degrees and awards concerning his country\\'s defense against the invading Germans.\\n\\nSection::::Death and legacy.\\nOn November 23, 1928, Thomas Fortune Ryan died, the South\\'s wealthiest native son and the nation\\'s 10th wealthiest man. He left a fortune of more than $200 million. He was buried on his Oak Ridge estate, as was his second wife, Mary. Although a place had been reserved for Ida Barry Ryan in the crypt of Richmond\\'s Sacred Heart Cathedral, she was ultimately interred in the cemetery at St. Andrews-on-Hudson Seminary in Hyde Park, New York (now The Culinary Institute of America).\\n\\nRyan\\'s eldest son John Barry Ryan (1874â1942) became a financier and writer. His grandson Allan A. Ryan Jr. (1903â1981) was a New York State Senator from 1939 to 1942. His granddaughter Sally Ryan was a noted art collector. A great-granddaughter is Virginia Fortune Ryan Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie, wife of David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie. Grandson Joseph Bondurant Ryan (1906â1950) was the visionary developer of the Mont Tremblant ski resort in Quebec. Joseph\\'s son Peter (1940â1962) was the first Canadian to compete in Formula 1 auto racing and the winner of the first Canadian Grand Prix in 1961.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Thomas Fortune Ryan', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=747853'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7480385', 'text': 'John Owen (cricketer)\\n\\nJohn Edward Houghton Owen (born 7 August 1971) is a former English cricketer represented Derbyshire between 1994 and 1999.\\n\\nOwen was the son of David Owen who was a cricketer for the Derbyshire Second XI during the early part of the 1970s.

These two companies have been competing since the 1890s, but their rivalry has intensified since the 1980s.\\n\\nSection::::Flavorings.\\nThe primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are citrus oils (from orange, lime, and lemon peels), cinnamon, vanilla, and an acidic flavorant. Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like nutmeg or coriander, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain citrus, vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid, sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. Coca-Cola\\'s recipe is maintained as a corporate trade secret.\\n\\nA variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas. In addition, stevia or an artificial sweetener may be used; \"sugar-free\" or \"diet\" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.\\n\\nSection::::Clear cola.\\nIn the 1940s, Coca-Cola produced White Coke at the request of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov.\\n\\nClear colas were again produced during the Clear Craze of the early 1990s. Brands included Crystal Pepsi, Tab Clear, and 7 Up Ice Cola. Crystal Pepsi has been repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s.\\n\\nIn Denmark, a popular clear cola was made by the Cooperative FDB in 1976. It was especially known for being the \"Hippie Cola\" because of the focus of the harmful effects the color additive could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands. It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the Environmental-Organisation NOAH, an independent Danish division of Friends of the Earth. This was followed up with a variety of sodas without artificial coloring. Today many organic colas are available in Denmark, but, for nostalgic reasons, clear cola has still maintained its popularity to a certain degree.\\n\\nIn June 2018, Coca-Cola introduced Coca-Cola Clear in Japan.\\n\\nSection::::Health effects.\\nA 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The phosphoric acid used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.\\n\\nStudies indicate \"soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in [the] American diet\", so most nutritionists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, riboflavin, and vitamin A.\\n\\nThe drink has also aroused criticism for its use of caffeine, which can cause physical dependence (caffeine addiction). A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake and osteoporosis in older women (but not men). This was thought to be due to the presence of phosphoric acid, and the risk was found to be the same for caffeinated and noncaffeinated colas, as well as the same for diet and sugared colas.\\n\\nMany soft drinks are sweetened mostly or entirely with high-fructose corn syrup, rather than sugar. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Cola', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7491', 'cat_id': '7491', 'cat_title': '1563', 'cat_pages': '19', 'cat_subcats': '15', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'NAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7492157', 'text': 'Petit bonhomme\\n\\n\"Petit bonhomme\" (English translation: \"Little Boy\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, performed in French by Luxembourgish singer Camillo Felgen.\\n\\nThis was Felgen\\'s second appearance on the Eurovision stage, in the 1960 Contest he had also represented Luxembourg, singing \"So laang we\\'s du do bast\" in Luxembourgish.\\n\\n\"Petit bonhomme\" is a ballad, with Felgen singing to a boy he identifies as his son near the end of the lyric.

Jeff Vrabel of \"Billboard\" remarked that the collection\\'s songs \"range from the interestingly raw to the unlistenable, especially when the band trades its slow-rolling, dub-style vibe for stabs at lo-fi punk.\" An article in the December 2006 issue of \"Spin\" said the box set is \"as close as Bradley Nowell cultists will ever get to a new Sublime release.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Everything Under the Sun', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7493068'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'NwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '74931', 'text': 'Inside Nazi Germany\\n\\nInside Nazi Germany is a 1938 short documentary film about Nazi Germany directed by Jack Glenn.

His works include \"Hart\\'s Hymns\", a much-loved hymn book amongst evangelical Christians throughout its lifetime of over 200 years, which includes the well-known hymn, \"Come ye sinners, poor and needy\".\\n\\nOne of Joseph Hart\\'s early publications was a tract denouncing Christianity (prior to his conversion) called \"The Unreasonableness of Religion, Being Remarks and Animadversions on the Rev. John Wesley\\'s Sermon on Romans 8:32\". His other works include a short autobiography and a few poetical translations of ancient classics.\\n\\nJoseph Hart preached at Jewin Street chapel in London, a building with multiple galleries, to a congregation of significant size.\\n\\nOnly one of Hart\\'s sermons remains discovered to us: that of Christmas 1767. Several of his hymns appear in the Sacred Harp.\\n\\nHart died on 24 May 1768, with a congregation estimated at tens of thousands around his graveside at Bunhill Fields.\\n\\nSection::::Early life (1712 to about 1732).\\nNot much is known about Hart\\'s early life due to scanty documentation.\\nJoseph Hart had a good educational upbringing, learning the classic languages (Latin, Hebrew, and Greek) to perfection, which afterwards he taught for a living. Hart spent a lot of his early life translating and writing poetry.\\n\\nIt was in this period of his life that Hart translated Herodian and Phycolides.\\n\\nHart writes about his early life in his own autobiography:\\n\\n\"As I had the happiness of being born of believing parents, I imbibed the sound doctrine of the Gospel from my infancy; nor was I without touches of the heart, checks of the conscience, and meltings of affections, by the secret strivings of God\\'s Spirit within me while very young; but the impressions were not deep, nor the influences lasting, being frequently defaced and quenched by the vanities and vices of childhood and youth.\\n\\nHart was brought up to be a good Christian and to praise God, but soon fell into temptation and sinned.\\n\\nSection::::Good works (about 1732 to about 1740).\\nJoseph Hart begins to see that his youthful sins are wrong, and decides he must learn to be a better person. It all seems to be going well, but there is one sin yet; Hart is proud of his new status as a religious man. Later Hart repents of this sin of pride and denounces it.\\n\\nIt is about this time of turmoil in Hart\\'s life, that he meets a girl (14 years younger than himself) called Mary, falls in love with her, and they get married.\\n\\nSection::::A libertine and an author (from about 1740 to about 1751/52).\\nIt was during this period of Hart\\'s life that he left off doing his good works, and became a libertine, believing that there is no need to be righteous, all you need is to believe in God, then salvation is certain. It was then that he wrote \"The Unreasonableness of Religion\", in an effort to convince John Wesley that he should not be doing good works only believing in God. Evidently the pamphlet had no effect upon Wesley, being accounted mere blasphemy. Later Hart repented of writing the pamphlet, giving his universal apology to John Wesley.\\n\\nDuring this period, Hart also translated Phycolides from the original Greek in 1744, and Herodian from its original Latin in 1749.\\n\\nSection::::A true conversion.\\nHart later considered that there was a need both to do good works and to believe in God. But then came the uncertainty: Was he really and truly saved? He had no indication from God, no elaborate vision, telling him that he had been saved. This was a great worry to Joseph Hart. He began to pray to God that there would be some revelation granted him, or perhaps just a little sign. This tormented Hart for more than a year.\\n\\nThen, the week before Easter of the year 1757 Hart \"had such an amazing view of the agony of Christ in the garden [of gethsemane]\" showing to Hart that all Christ\\'s sufferings were for him (along with the rest of the church).\\n\\nBut soon after this, Hart again began to be afraid of the life to come- eternity, and feared exceedingly when reading about the condemned in passages in the Bible.\\n\\nBut It was on Whitsunday that Hart\\'s true conversion came. Hart was converted under the ministry of George Whitefield, and felt blessed in his soul.\\n\\nAfter these times Hart still had sufferings and uncertainties as to his conversion, but he could always look back to his conversion, and believe that God saved his soul.\\n\\nHart\\'s motto after this time was: \"Pharasaic zeel and Antinomian security are the two engines of Satan, with which he grinds the church in all ages, as betwixt [between] the upper and the nether [lower] millstone. The space between them is much narrower and harder to find than most men imagine. It is a path which the vulture\\'s eye hath not seen; and none can show it us but the Holy Ghost.\"\\n\\nOn his tombstone he had written the following.\\n\\n\"Joseph Hart was by the free and sovereign grace and Spirit of God raised up from the depths of sin, and delivered from the bonds of mere profession and self-righteousness, and led to rest entirely for salvation in the finished atonement and perfect obedience of Christ.\"\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Joseph Hart', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7529180'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7529995', 'text': 'Lott Warren\\n\\nLott Warren (October 30, 1797 â June 17, 1861) was a United States Representative from Georgia.

In the early nineteenth century, under pressure from their hostile Mohave and Quechan neighbors, they moved to the middle Gila River, where some merged with the Maricopa, and others went on to Salt River and maintained an independent identity.\\n\\nThe Halchidhoma currently speak the Maricopa language.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Halchidhoma entered written history in 1604â1605, when a Spanish expedition coming overland from New Mexico under Juan de OÃ±ate encountered the \"Alebdoma\" on the lower Colorado River, below its junction with the Gila River. When the Jesuit missionary-explorer Eusebio Francisco Kino returned to the river in 1700, the Halchidhoma had moved to a portion of the river 100 miles farther north.\\n\\nA system of military alliances and traditional hostilities seems to have prevailed among the relatively warlike tribes of the lower Colorado and Gila rivers. This may account for the Halchidhoma\\'s move during the seventeenth century. The Halchidhoma were part of an alliance that also included the Maricopa and Cocopa, among others, and was opposed by the Quechan and Mohave. In the 1820s, the Halchidhoma were finally driven from the Colorado River. They took refuge with the Maricopa on the middle Gila River. In the following decades, some continued on to Lehi on the Salt River and maintained a separate identity, while others stayed and became assimilated to the Maricopa. The territory on the Colorado River vacated by the Halchidhoma was subsequently occupied by the Chemehuevi.\\n\\nSection::::Population.\\nEstimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. \"(See Population of Native California.)\" The Franciscan missionary-explorer Francisco GarcÃ©s estimated the Halchidhoma population in 1776 as 2,500. Alfred L. Kroeber (1925:883) put the 1770 population of the Halchidhoma at 1,000.\\n\\nSection::::Language.\\nHistorical records indicate that there once was a separate Halchidhoma language within the Yuman family, in the River Yuman subdivision. Due to war and conflict with European settlers, the Halchidhoma settled in with the Maricopa people, in their current location around Greater Phoenix. The Halchidhoma currently identify themselves with the Maricopa tribe, and many live in Lehi, which is a small community within the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community on the south banks of the Salt River. They continue to speak what they refer to as the Halchidhoma language.\\n\\nSection::::Modern relationship with Maricopa.\\nHalchidhoma people in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community nearly universally identify themselves in English as Maricopa, although both groups testify that they are separate, maintaining separate languages and identities (Kelly 1972:264).\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Halchidhoma', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7531626'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7532410', 'text': 'Snow Peak\\n\\nSnow Peak may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Snow Peak', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7532410'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7533517', 'text': \"Athena Technologies\\n\\nAthena Technologies was a developer and manufacturer of control and navigation solutions for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs).

The meeting was attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and President Ä°smet Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ of the Republic of Turkey.\\n\\nUntil 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill maintained the opinion that Turkey\\'s continuing neutrality would serve the interests of the Allies by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. But the early victories of the Axis until the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate a possible Turkish participation in the war on the side of the Allies. Turkey had maintained a decently-sized Army and Air Force throughout the war, and especially Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the Balkans. On January 30, 1943, Churchill had secretly met with Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ inside a train wagon at the Yenice Station, 23 kilometers outside of Adana in Turkey, to discuss the issue (see the Adana Conference.)\\n\\nRoosevelt, on the other hand, still believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky and an eventual Turkish failure would have disastrous effects for the Allies.\\n\\nÄ°nÃ¶nÃ¼ knew very well the hardships and losses of territory which his country had to suffer during 11 years of incessant war (the Italo-Turkish War, the Balkan Wars, the First World War, and the Turkish War of Independence) between 1911 and 1922, and was determined to keep Turkey out of another war as long as he could. Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ also wanted assurances on financial and military aid for Turkey, as well as a guarantee that the United States and the United Kingdom would stand beside Turkey in case of a Soviet invasion of the Turkish Straits after the war, as Joseph Stalin had openly expressed. The fear of a Soviet invasion and Stalin\\'s unconcealed desire to control the Turkish Straits eventually caused Turkey to give up its principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO in 1952.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest reason for Turkey\\'s hesitation to immediately join the war on the side of the Allies was the eventual reduction of the amount of financial and military aid which Churchill had promised in Adana. By December 1943 the Anglo-American authorities felt the overall situation had changed so fundamentally that a much smaller scale of assistance than that provided in the Hardihood Agreement of the spring of 1943 would be necessary. The British proposed a reduced scale of Aid Plan Saturn. The Turks, on the other hand, wished to make certain that upon their entry into the war they would be strong enough to defend their homeland and they doubted that the new plan would fully meet their security needs. Churchill, faced with Operation Overlord only six months away, reluctantly concluded that the resources demanded and the time required for strengthening Turkey could not be conceded. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff and their planners, on the other hand, felt relieved that this possible threat to concentration on Operation Overlord had at last been removed.\\n\\nAt the end of the conference, it was decided that Turkey\\'s neutrality should be maintained. It was also decided to build the Incirlik Air Base near Adana for possible Allied air operations in the region, but construction works began after the end of the Second World War. Incirlik Air Base later played an important role for NATO during the Cold War. Another decision was to postpone Operation Anakim against Japan in Burma.\\n\\nBoth Roosevelt and Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ got what they wanted, while Churchill was a bit disappointed, because he believed that an active Turkish participation in the war would quicken the German defeat by hitting their \"\"soft underbelly\"\" in the southeast.\\n\\nTurkey eventually joined the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945, after it was announced at the Yalta Conference that only the states which were formally at war with Germany and Japan by 1 March 1945 would be admitted to the United Nations. However, Turkey didn\\'t directly participate in a military conflict; limiting its participation to providing materials and supplies for the Allies, and imposing political and economic sanctions on the Axis states.\\n\\nAlso discussed was the independence of Indochina from the French Colonial Empire, as documented briefly by the Pentagon Papers.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Second Cairo Conference', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7534287'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7534759', 'text': 'Iino Domain\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIino Domain was created when a 7000 \"koku\" \"hatamoto,\" Hoshina Masasada was granted an additional 10,000 \"koku\" of territory in Settsu Province after his appointment as Justicar of Osaka in 1648.

The fertile, mostly flat land and Monocacy River were enticing to European immigrants and settlers moving west into the newly-opened Monocacy Hundred territory. Among these earliest settlers in the region were Henry and Josiah Ballenger, Sr., Quakers who moved into the Province of Maryland from the Colony of New Jersey. Members of the Ballenger family as well as the Davis Family who were also Quakers organized a Society of Friends at âMonoqueseyâ [Monocacy] and Meridith Davis donated land from his âGood Luckâ tract on which to build a meetinghouse in 1739. Though the meeting at Monocacy was short-lived, many of its early members moving into Virginia to join larger Quaker communities there, the Society of Friends near Buckeystown was among the first religious organizations effected within present-day Frederick County and western Maryland. During the American Revolutionary War period, brothers John and George Buckey settled on the old âGood Luckâ tract and initiated commercial and industrial establishments which led to the formation of the village. Much of the townâs growth in the 19th century was supported by the Baker family who purchased the Buckey tannery in 1832 and later founded the townâs cannery, Methodist Church, and an industrial school for boys.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nBuckeytown is located in southern Frederick County along Maryland Route 85, which leads north to Frederick, the county seat, and south to Maryland Route 28 near the Potomac River.

Primarily a superhero anthology, it ran eight issues from 1940 to 1942, and is notable for work by Carl Burgos, Bill Everett, Alex Schomburg, and the team of Joe Simon & Jack Kirby.\\n\\n\"Daring Mystery Comics\" #8 (Jan. 1942) features the first appearance of the Golden Age superhero Citizen V, who decades later appears in flashback in the Marvel series \"Thunderbolts\", where his family and the Citizen V identity play a major part. A small handful of other \"Daring Mystery\" superheroes have been revived or have made guest appearances in modern-day titles, such as the World War II-set flashback series \"The Invaders\" and the feature \"Liberty Legion\" in \"Marvel Premiere\".\\n\\nSection::::Publication history.\\n\"Daring Mystery Comics\" came from publisher Martin Goodman\\'s Timely Comics, which by the early 1960s would evolve into Marvel Comics. The first five issues were nominally edited by Goodman, but were in fact mixtures of material bought from Funnies, Inc. or the Harry \"A\" Chesler studio, both prominent comic-book \"packagers\" who produced stories or even complete, outsourced comics on demand for publishers entering the fledgling medium. Timely\\'s first in-house editor, Joe Simon, relaunched the series with issue #6 as his second project for Goodman and remained for the last few issues.\\n\\nFollowing \"Daring Mystery Comics\" #1-8 (Jan. 1940 - Jan. 1942) and a publishing hiatus, the series\\' numbering continued under different titles. In a quirk of publishing involving U.S. Postal Service regulations and mailing costs, and a World War II, paper-supply-related moratorium on launching new series, publisher Goodman somehow continued the series numbering as both \"Daring Comics\" for four issues from 1944 to 1945, and as \"Comedy Comics\" for 26 issues from 1942-1946, both of which launched with an issue #9.\\n\\nSection::::Characters.\\nAn anthology with no regular star, the series included a number of obscure, mostly single-appearance features. Due to Golden Age comics work often going unsigned, comprehensive credits are difficult if not impossible to ascertain, and in many early cases, a feature\\'s artist is also the uncredited writer.\\n\\nThe best known superheroes to debut in its pages were the Blue Diamond, by artist co-creator Ben Thompson; writer-artist Bill Everett\\'s the Fin; and the Thunderer, created by writer John H. Compton and notable for artist co-creator Carl Burgos. All three heroes were introduced in issue #7 (April 1941). In the 1970s, the Blue Diamond resurfaced in period stories in \"Marvel Premiere\", as a member of the homefront World War II team the Liberty Legion. He also appeared in writer Paul Jenkins\\' 2011 miniseries \"All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes\" (2011). Two characters introduced here, writer-artist Joe Simon\\'s Fiery Mask, and writer Will Harr and artist Maurice Gutwirth\\'s Laughing Mask, who became the Purple Mask, appeared in present-day stories after awakening from suspended animation alongside 10 other Timely heroes in Marvel Comics\\' 2007-2008 and 2012 miniseries \"The Twelve\".\\n\\nOther heroes included the Challenger, drawn by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski under the pseudonym Nick Karlton; Dynaman, by artist and possibly writer Steve Dahlman; and the superheroine the Silver Scorpion, created or co-created by artist and sometime-writer Harry Sahle using the pen name Jewell, which comics historian Michael J. Vassallo believes marked a collaboration with another, unknown artist.\\n\\nThe final three issues contained work by the commercially popular team of writer-inker Joe Simon and penciler and sometimes co-scripter Jack Kirby. They collaborated on the covers of #6 (July 1940) and #8 (Jan. 1942), the former of which also featured a 10-page Simon & Kirby story introducing the single-appearance superhero Marvel Boy (the first of several Marvel Universe characters to take that name), and 10-page story starring the previously introduced Fiery Mask. Issue #7 (April 1941) contained an eight-page Simon & Kirby story introducing the obscure Captain Daring (taken over for the next and last issue by artist Frank Borth, and continuing as Captain Dash in \"Comedy Comics\" #9). One of the first superhero parodies â Stuporman, by Harry Douglas who signed his name \"Harry / Douglas\" leading to much confusion and many theories over the possibility of two creators â debuted in issue #6 (Sept. 1940).\\n\\nNon-superhero features included \"G-Man, Don Gorman\", a single-issue cover character by unknown creators, though inked by future notable Dick Briefer; \"Soldier of Fortune, John Steele\" and \"Monako the Master Magician\" a.k.a. \"Monako, Prince of Magic\", both by artist co-creator Larry Antonette (under the pseudonym Dean Carr for \"John Steele\"); \"K-4 and the Sky Devils\", by uncertain creators; \"Whirlwind Carter of the Interplanetary Secret Service\", by writer-artist Fletcher Hanks; the jungle-lord adventure \"Trojak the Tiger Man\", by artist co-creator Joe Simon using the byline Gregory Sykes; artist co-creator Ben Thompson\\'s single-appearance Western \"Robin Hood of the Range\", featuring the first of two Marvel characters called the Texas Kid; and the college football-set \"Flash Foster at Midwestern\", by writer and artist Bob Wood.\\n\\nThe comic\\'s first five covers were by artist Alex Schomburg.\\n\\n\\nSection::::In other media.\\nThe Thunderer appeared in the \"Six Forgotten Warriors\" episode of one of the Spider-Man animated television series.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Daring Mystery Comics', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7543734'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7544160', 'text': 'St Thomas\\'s Abbey, Brno\\n\\nSt Thomas\\'s Abbey (or the KÃ¶nigskloster) is an Augustinian church located in Brno in the Czech Republic.

This was the early beginning of a long and significant musical tradition at the Brno monastery. In 1780s, the Emperor Joseph II forced the friars to move out because he liked their well-located and representative buildings.

VI, cap. XXX; Sess. XXII cap.ii, iii) that there is a purgatory, and that the souls therein are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but principally by the acceptable Sacrifice of the Altar; the Holy Synod enjoins on the Bishops that they diligently endeavor to have the sound doctrine of the Fathers in Councils regarding purgatory everywhere taught and preached, held and believed by the faithful\" (Denzinger, \"Enchiridon\", 983).\\n\\nSection::::Various interpretations of the image.\\nThe Anima Sola is taken to represent a soul suffering in purgatory. While in many cases chromolithographs depict a female soul, many other figures such as popes and other men are commonly depicted in chromolithographs, sculptures and paintings. In the most commonly known image of the Anima Sola, a woman is depicted as breaking free from her chains in a dungeon setting surrounded by flames, representing purgatory. She appears penitent and reverent, and her chains have been broken, an indication that, after her temporary suffering, she is destined for heaven.\\n\\nPraying to the Anima Sola is a tradition in many ways unlike that of the more widespread cult of saints. In lieu of praying to a saint who then appeals to God, the Anima Sola represents souls in purgatory who require the assistance both of the living and the divine to ameliorate their sufferings in the afterlife.\\n\\nThe Anima Sola is common throughout much of the Catholic world, though is perhaps strongest in Naples, where it is referred to as \"the cult of the souls in Purgatory.\" In Latin America, one source reports, the Anima Sola is \"a belief still deeply rooted in the mass of the campesinos. The devotion dates from the first colonizers, who probably brought the image in which the soul is represented as a woman suffering torments in purgatory with chains binding her hands. A legend concerning the \\'thirst of Christ\\', about which Scripture seems to say nothing, passes from mouth to mouth: They say that in Jerusalem, there were women who gave drink to those who were being crucified. On the afternoon of Good Friday it fell to a young woman, Celestina Abdenago, to go up Calvary. From a jar she gave a drink to Dismas and Gestas, yet she despised the Saviour; and for that reason, he condemned her to suffer thirst and the constant heat of purgatory.\"\\n\\nSection::::Magical traditions.\\nAs with many Catholic symbols, the image is also appears in spiritist traditions. As described in \"The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells\" by Judika Illes:\\n\\nAnother interpretation is that the sacred figures most frequently invoked include the \"Lonely Soul\" [Anima Sola], who requires prayers because of her predicament; San Silvestre, magical because of the date of his feast day; and Santa Elena and San Onofre.\\n\\nSection::::SanterÃ­a and Lukumi.\\nIn SanterÃ­a or Lukumi, the Afro-Caribbean religion of Cuba, there is a syncretization of the Anima Sola with the Eshu Alleguana. The Eshus are the Divine Messengers, the Tricksters, The Masters of the Roads and the Doors that are necessary for all prayers to reach their intended point. Eshu Allegwanna, one Eshu among hundreds, is thought to be the oldest of the Eshus, and to have existed on the Earth since a primordial time long before not only people, but before many of the gods of the religion, existed in the world. Therefore, he is synchronized with The Lonely Spirit, as many of the African Gods were synchronized with Catholic saints, or hidden behind them, in the first centuries of slavery, when the practice of the African religions were oppressed. Anima Sola is grouped in a triad in some traditions with The Intranquil Spirit and the Dominant Spirit.\\n', 'title': 'Anima Sola', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7545639'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7552733', 'text': 'LVS-86\\n\\nLVS-86 is a model of tramcar developed at the Leningrad Tram Manufacturing Plant in the former Soviet Union.

In an episode of \"Bo\\' Selecta!\", it was revealed that he used to have a problem, which caused him to shout out bad words at anyone. He has, however, broke the habit by thinking of women to take his mind off of it. After fantasizing about women, his tail will pop out.

He participated in the First Serbian Uprising, led Serbs in the Second Serbian Uprising, and founded the House of ObrenoviÄ. Under his rule, Serbia became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire. Prince MiloÅ¡ ruled autocratically, permanently refusing to share power. During his rule, he was the richest man in Serbia and one of the richest in the Balkans.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nMiloÅ¡ TeodoroviÄ () was the son of Teodor \"TeÅ¡a\" MihailoviÄ (died 1802) from Dobrinja, and ViÅ¡nja (died 18 June 1817). This was the second marriage of his mother ViÅ¡nja, from which also sprung Jovan (1787â1850) and Jevrem (1790â1856). From ViÅ¡nja\\'s first marriage, with Obren MartinoviÄ (died 1780) from Brusnica, MiloÅ¡ had half-brothers Jakov (died 1811) and Milan (died 1810), and half-sister Stana. After the death of Obren, ViÅ¡nja moved from Brusnica and married Teodor in Dobrinja. After the death of his brother Milan, a famed revolutionary with great reputation among the people, MiloÅ¡ adopted the surname ObrenoviÄ. In official documents, his name was sometimes written MiloÅ¡ TeodoroviÄ ObrenoviÄ.\\n\\nSection::::First Serbian Uprising.\\nMiloÅ¡ fought in the First Serbian Uprising until its very end in 1813. His half-brother Milan also took part in the Uprising, rising to become the \"vojvoda\" (commander, duke) of the Rudnik district, until his death in 1810. After Milan\\'s death, MiloÅ¡ adopted the surname of his half-brother, ObrenoviÄ. This name was the patronymic which his half-brother derived from Obren, the first name of his own father (MiloÅ¡\\'s step-father). After the rebellion collapsed, MiloÅ¡ was among the few of its leaders that remained in Serbia to face the returning Ottomans.\\n\\nSection::::Second Serbian Uprising.\\nIn April 1815, Prince MiloÅ¡ organized and led the Second Serbian Uprising. After defeating the Turks, and Napoleon\\'s defeat in Russia, the Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815. After the killing of KaraÄorÄe PetroviÄ, in 1817, ObrenoviÄ became the leader of the Serbs. As a result of the agreement, Serbia gained some autonomy, but remained under Ottoman sovereignty. MiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ was left in power as its absolute ruler.\\n\\nBetween the end of 1828 and the autumn of 1830, Prince MiloÅ¡ created a so-called \"legislative commission\" to translate the Code NapolÃ©on into Serbian and codify the laws and customs of the country. After discussing the commission, MiloÅ¡ invited two distinguished legal specialists to come from Hungary to prepare a more suitable criminal and civil code of laws for Serbia. They were Vasilije LazareviÄ, \"BÃ¼rgermeister\" (mayor) of Zemun, and Jovan HadÅ¾iÄ, lawyer, poet, and member of the municipal senate of Novi Sad.\\n\\nIn January 1831, Prince MiloÅ¡ informed a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial edict from the Sultan ending all direct obligations of Serbian peasants to their former Turkish lords, guaranteeing Ottoman recognition of Serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration, and offering Serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement, as well as the express right to institute schools, courts, and a governmental administration of her own. The Sultan\\'s decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory, and made Serbia a sovereign principality, with MiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ as hereditary prince. A Metropolitanate of Serbia was established in Belgrade as an autonomous unit of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Russia\\'s status as the guarantor of Serbia\\'s autonomy was also recognized.\\n\\nSection::::Reign.\\nThe supporters of the rule of law often rebelled against MiloÅ¡\\'s government. Following one such rebellion, he agreed to adopt a constitution, the \"Sretenje\" or Candlemas constitution, in 1835. The move was opposed by neighboring Austria, the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia. It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government. Metternich\\'s Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and foreign ministry. MiloÅ¡ abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and Turkey, and it was replaced by the \"Turkish\" Constitution of 1838.\\n\\nMiloÅ¡ abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sonsâMilan, who died a few weeks later, and Mihailo, who then became prince. Mihailo was deposed in 1842, and the family was out of power until 1858, when it returned with MiloÅ¡ restored as prince for the last two years of his life.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nMiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ was given the epithet \"the Great\". He was proclaimed \"Father of the Fatherland\" by the National Assembly.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Marriage and children.\\nIn 1805, MiloÅ¡ married Ljubica VukomanoviÄ (September 1785 â Vienna, 26 May 1843). The couple had eight children whose names are known. It is speculated that Ljubica had other pregnancies that resulted in miscarriages, stillbirths, or children who died shortly after birth, with some sources giving a number as high as 17 pregnancies.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'MiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=756514'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7567061', 'text': 'StebnÃ­cka Huta\\n\\nStebnÃ­cka Huta is a village and municipality in Bardejov District in the PreÅ¡ov Region of north-east Slovakia.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn historical records the village was first mentioned in 1600\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nThe municipality lies at an altitude of 505 metres and covers an area of 9.433\\xa0kmÂ².\\nIt has a population of about 255 people.\\n\\n', 'title': 'StebnÃ­cka Huta', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7567061'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7570968', 'text': 'St Oliver Plunketts/Eoghan Ruadh GAA\\n\\nSt. Oliver Plunkett Eoghan Ruadh (Irish: \"Naomh OilibhÃ©ar PluincÃ©ad, Eoghan Ruadh\" ) is a Gaelic Athletic Association club situated on the Navan Road on the Northside of Dublin, Ireland.

Mary Sampson was a devout member of the Church of England, and raised her daughter and Thomas\\' two children from a previous marriage in adherence to her faith. Few details are known about Elizabeth\\'s family or her early life, however, her autobiography sheds light on some aspects of her life. In her autobiography, which details her life from the time she was first married until the death of her second husband, Ashbridge reveals that when she was 14 years old, in 1727, she eloped without parental consent, only to become a widow after five months of marriage.\\n\\nUnwelcome at her parents\\' home, Ashbridge was sent to Dublin, Ireland; there, she resided first in Dublin with a relative of her mother and member of the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Upon finding life in accordance with his strict religious beliefs \"gloomy\", she moved to Ireland\\'s west coast, where she stayed with Catholic relatives.\\nSection::::Voyage to the U.S. and life in New England.\\nIn 1732 Ashbridge sailed to New York as an indentured servant, owned first by a woman in the slave trade and later by the ship\\'s captain. After completing three of the four years of servitude required to pay her passage to the colonies, she bought her freedom with money she earned performing odd jobs and sewing. With her new-found freedom she considered a career on the stage, even going so far as to befriend members of local playhouses and study scripts in her spare time; instead, she married a school teacher surnamed Sullivan.\\n\\nThe nature of Sullivan\\'s profession led the couple to travel widely throughout New England in search of schools in need of a schoolmaster. They settled briefly in Westerly, Rhode Island, where Ashbridge half-heartedly joined the Baptist church. After a failed attempt to travel to England, they moved to Boston in 1735, then back to Rhode Island later that year, where Ashbridge once again joined the Church of England. While visiting relatives in Pennsylvania, Ashbridge was taken with the Quaker faith, and became convinced, much to the disapproval of her husband. The couple stayed some time in Delaware, then moved on to Mount Holly, New Jersey, home of the influential Quaker John Woolman. Both Ashbridge and her husband taught school there. Her religious beliefs caused much turmoil in her marriage, and, in a drunken stupor, Sullivan enlisted himself as a soldier and left for Cuba in 1740. Later, claiming the Quaker\\'s right to pacifism, he was beaten brutally for his refusal to serve and died in a hospital near London in 1741. Her autobiography ends with Sullivan\\'s death.\\n\\nSection::::Indentured Servitude.\\nAs part of her journey to America, Elizabeth Ashbridge was eventually placed in a cruel household where she lived as an indentured servant. Since she was about to make her first transatlantic passage, Ashbridge was unaware of the dangers involved with an ocean voyage. One of those dangers was the threat of being taken as an indentured servant. Initially, Ashbridge thought a woman she was to accompany to America would be a kind \"Gentlewoman\" companion; however, before Ashbridge realized that her companion had malicious motives, she was kidnapped and kept aboard a ship for three weeks.\\n\\nFollowing her captivity, Ashbridge was still determined to travel to America, and she returned to the ship. Shortly after, Ashbridge learned that some Irish servants had planned a mutiny. In spite of her informing the ship\\'s captain of the planned attack on the crew, Ashbridge was forced into servitude: \"The captain caused an indenture to be made, and threatened me with a gaol, if I refused to sign it.\" Ashbridge lacked the travel funds to make her way across the Atlantic, and the captain took advantage of her misfortune.\\n\\nOnce in America, Ashbridge lived with a hypocritical master who outwardly demonstrated his religious practices; however, he was tyrannical and abusive toward his servant. In one instance, her master requests the service of the \"town whipper\" to discipline Ashbridge. Although his treatment is cruel, Ashbridge notes, in a moment of confident desperation, \"Then, fixing my eyes upon this barbarous man, I said, âSir, . . . if you think that I deserve such punishment, do it yourself.\" After three years of living under indentured servitude, Ashbridge was able to purchase her freedom by buying out the remaining terms of her contract. Her experience with such difficult circumstances prompted her to question her own belief in God: \"I became hardened and was ready to conclude that there was no God.\" Roxanne Harde examines criticism that suggests that Ashbridge\\'s denying of the master\\'s religious beliefs is an example of how this strong Quaker minister exercises Agency and finds her own religious voice. Ashbridge likely already knew the role her poor financial situation played in obtaining her contract of indentured servitude. Thus she became more financially empowered as a result of the difficult experiences in her master\\'s home. To survive, Ashbridge would sew, and she explains that \"when I had Served near three years, I bought off the remainder of my Time & then took to my needle, by which I could maintain my Self handsomely.\" \\n\\nSection::::Rebellion and Reconciliation with Patriarchy.\\nAt the beginning of \"Some Account of the Early Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge\", Ashbridge remarks that her father was absent from the Ashbridge household while she growing up. As a surgeon, Mr. Ashbridge \"made many long voyages\" and left young Elizabeth with her mother. As Ashbridge ages, her mother becomes a \"pattern of virtue\" for her to follow.\\n\\nAround the age of twelve, Ashbridge begins to feel conflicting emotions towards religion: she disregards religion, but also has an intense desire to be loved by the Lord. These emotions indicate that Ashbridge correlated \"the Lord\" with her absent father. She wants to be loved by these paternal figures and is angered that she does not feel such love. At the age of fourteen, Ashbridge rejects patriarchy by abruptly leaving her father\\'s house and entering into an improper marriage. After the death of her husband five months later, her father refuses to accept her back into his household. Her mother sends her to Dublin until she can re-gain her father\\'s affections. In this account, Ashbridge portrays her mother as a welcoming figure, and her father as a repulsive force.\\n\\nWhile away from her mother, Ashbridge becomes acquainted with a Catholic widow. She begins to associate this woman as her motherly role model and even begins to adhere to the Catholic faith. They spoke to each other freely about religion, with \"each of [them] defending [their] particular tenets.\" It was these conversations that made Ashbridge curious about Roman Catholicism; she was intrigued by the widow\\'s tales of \"such mighty miracles, done by their priests\" that Ashbridge \"began to be shaken in [her] own belief.\" Asbridge began to attend mass with the widow because, though interested, she was \"yet resolved not blindly to adopt their creed.\" She reaches the point of conversion, but speaking with the Catholic priest drives her away from the religion. Ashbridge\\'s tone towards the Roman Catholic belief system, though she almost converted, was mostly negative. She calls them \"papists,\" which was a widely used descriptor but was chiefly negative. While she was \"not averse\" to confessing her sins, she called the recital of beliefs the priest wanted her to swear by \"ridiculous\" and said they \"made [her] sick of [her] new intention.\" At this point in her spiritual journey, Ashbridge cannot adhere to a religion in which she feels directly influenced by the patriarchal system.\\n\\nAshbridge\\'s tendency to seek motherly figures is also shown when she naively trusts the \"gentlewoman\" who promises her passage to Pennsylvania. After realizing that this woman has betrayed her, Ashbridge refers to her as a \"vile creature.\" At this point in the autobiography, Ashbridge begins to portray women in all of their complexities. Once in America, Ashbridge remarries a man that she does not truly love. Though she never states the exact reason for the marriage, Ashbridge implies that there was some sort of superficial or physical connection that brought the two together.\\n\\nIn her marriage, she feels, once again, the repression of patriarchal rule. In a second blatant rebellion of patriarchy, Ashbridge steps outside of her marriage to pursue her spiritual convictions. In the Quaker religion, Ashbridge finds a sense of community, rather than a patriarchal hierarchy. The Quaker religion welcomed female speakers who were considered spiritually equal to their male counterparts. In this community, Ashbridge finds an escape from male-dominated society. As she continues to attend Quaker meetings, she ceases to associate the Lord with an absent male figure. In her final conversion experience, Ashbridge notes that a woman brings the invitation of salvation to her, as she states: \"â¦there stood a grave \"woman\", holding in her right hand a lamp burningâ¦[she] said, âI am sent to tell thee that, if thou wilt return to the Lord thy God, who created thee, he will have mercy on theeâ¦â\"\\n\\nSection::::Ashbridge\\'s Abusive Second Marriage.\\nAshbridge begins her account by informing the reader that her life has been characterized by hardships and evil, not least of which came at the hand of her second husband, Sullivan. Ashbridge enters the \"unaccountable\" marriage with a man she \"did not esteem\" shortly after being released from indentured servitude. Of her second marriage, she states, \"I released myself from one cruel servitude, and, in the course of a few months, entered into another for life,\" an unwise decision which left her to view herself as \"ruined\" She alludes to unhealthy marital relations from the beginning, andâdespite occasional periods of peaceâthe relationship was most often characterized by unhappiness and abuse. Whereas Ashbridge refers to her first husband as \"the darling of my heart\", she says of her second husband: \"I was in love with nothing I saw in him\". Although she describes feeling \"more affectionate\" toward Sullivan after being baptized and beginning to keep \"the true sabbath\", this positive statement is one of the very few contained in her autobiographical account. Frequently, Ashbridge relates being victim to verbal and emotional abuse by her husband. After he hears she has \"turned Quaker,\" for example, he tells her he would rather have heard she was dead and shortly thereafter flies \"into a rage\" at her for using the word \"thee\". In one particularly disturbing scene he demonstrates physical violence by forcing her to dance with him in front of a group of male friends, despite her resistance and weeping. Eventually, another man has to step in and tell Sullivan to \"let your wife alone\".\\n\\nAshbridge is determined to pursue her Quaker faith, but her husband does all in his power to prevent her. He refuses to let her take his horse to meetings, forcing her to walk the eight miles on foot. When her shoes wore out from so much walking, he refused her a new pair, thinking this would prevent her attendance at meetings. She relates: \"finding that all the means he had yet used could not alter my resolutions, he several times struck me with severe blows...Once he came up to me, took out his penknife, and said, \\'If you offer to go to meeting to-morrow, with this knife I\\'ll cripple you, for you shall not be a Quaker\\'\". Ultimately, she views her second marriage as \"the trial of [her] faith\". Fortunately, however, Sullivan eventually abandoned her to military service, died, and she was able to remarry a man who was much more understanding of her religious convictions and aspirations.\\n\\nSection::::Religion.\\nSection::::Spiritual Autobiography.\\nSometime between the death of her second husband in 1741 and her marriage to Aaron Ashbridge in 1746, Elizabeth Ashbridge recorded the story of her life with focus on her religious experiences and conversion to the Society of Friends. Titled \"Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge\", her spiritual and historical narrative is the source of the majority of present-day knowledge regarding her early life and religious beliefs. Few records exist regarding her life in colonial America prior to her activism in the Society of Friends. Even the original manuscript of her \"Account\" is not accounted for; most later editions are based on the first edition, published in 1774.\\n\\nChronologically, Ashbridge\\'s narrative begins with her childhood in England and her subsequent moves to Ireland and America, and ends with the death of her second husband. While dates and names are included in her narrative, much of it is dedicated to her religious experience and her acceptance of the \"true\" faith. The autobiography traces her childhood in the Church of England, her early experiences with Quaker and Catholic relatives, her brief foray into the Baptist church, and ends with her acceptance of and into the Society of Friends. Such documentation of spiritual and religious journeys were not uncommon among those of the faith at the time. John Woolman\\'s spiritual autobiography was very popular both within the Quaker church and throughout New England. Ashbridge\\'s narrative was first published posthumously in 1774 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In later meetings, Ashbridge encounters William Hammons, a Quaker leader. He becomes the first male figure that Ashbridge notably holds in esteem. Ashbridge seems able to accept any person who comes on the ground of equality established within the Quaker community.\\n\\nSection::::Construction of Ashbridge\\'s Spiritual Autobiography.\\nWhile Ashbridge\\'s narrative, \"Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge\", was not the first text to employ the emerging literary style of the spiritual autobiography, it did help to perpetuate the popularity of the format in the years following her narrative. Ashbridge was at the forefront of writers employing this literary strategy, and would have been conscious of its specific writing style, although she does not explicitly follow its structure verbatim. Her testimony narrates her exposure and acceptance of Quakerism, showing Ashbridge as not \"the victim of her fears and doubts, but as an opponent engaged in an extended struggle\", which she eventually overcomes. Traditionally, the format of a spiritual autobiography often follows four pre-established stages:\\n\\n\\nIn her own way, Ashbridge addresses each of these stages. As chronicled in the above section, her story begins with details of her youth, including the estrangement from her family due to her first marriage. She also recalls her struggles with religion, and her attempts to reconcile her identity within a certain denomination. This immediately draws reader focus into an awareness of focalization and Ashbridge\\'s internal struggle. The introduction of Ashbridge\\'s second marriage cues the second stage of her spiritual autobiography. Ashbridge writes shortly after accounting her second marriage that \"[her] mind was still not satisfied, with regard to religion. [She] had reformed her conduct, so as to be accounted, by those who knew [her], as a sober woman; yet [she] was not content\".\\n\\nIn an effort to settle her anxieties, Ashbridge again works to find her identity within religion. She eventually finds this identity within the practice of Quakerism, although she struggles initially to acknowledge herself as a Quaker. Ashbridge\\'s narrative climaxes with her dramatic acceptance and final conversation experience, as written in her narrative:Laying aside my prejudices, [I] opened my heart to receive the truth; the beauty of which was shown to me ... I had also revealed to me the emptiness of all shadows and types, which, though proper in their day, were now, by the coming of the Son of God, at an end, and everlasting righteousness ... was to be established in the room thereof. I was permitted to see that all I had gone through was to prepare me for this day.\\n\\nAlthough Ashbridge\\'s continues to struggle with her husband and his acceptance of her as a Quaker, she finds the religious contentment she so adamantly desired. Her narrative becomes not only a personal account of religious fulfillment, but also a key example of the style and development of the spiritual autobiography. The use of this literary structure would become common amongst writers of the time, creating widely popularized publications. Ashbridge, conscious of this growing trend, configured her own writings to loosely follow this format, but conceptually remained focused on narrating her attempt to overcome her internal struggle.\\n\\nSection::::Traveling ministry.\\nOn May 7, 1746, Elizabeth married Aaron Ashbridge, a well-known member of the Quaker community in Chester County, Pennsylvania. After becoming an authoritative speaker at the Goshen, Pennsylvania Quaker meetings, she appeared with other prominent Quakers such as John Woolman, Jane Fenn Hoskens, and Anthony Benezet at the General Spring Meeting of ministers and elders in Philadelphia in 1752. The signature on the roster, signed March 16, is the only surviving sample of Ashbridge\\'s handwriting. In 1753, she became a recorded minister of the church and, with the consent of her husband, traveled through England and Ireland speaking at meeting houses testifying to her spiritual journey.\\n\\nSection::::Later Years.\\nIn a note written by Aaron Ashbridge, it is revealed that Ashbridge remarried in 1746. After her marriage to Aaron, Ashbridge became a Quaker minister. In 1753, Ashbridge left for Ireland for a \"religious visit\", with the consent of her husband, where she would stay until her death in 1755. Her final days are recorded in an excerpt from a testimony of the National-Meeting of Ireland, concerning Ashbridge, which is included in the published copy of her autobiography.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nIn Cork, Ireland, Ashbridge fell sick with an unknown illness, attributing her poor health to \"bodily hardship in traveling\" and \"spiritual exercise in mind\". After several weeks she proceeded to Waterford, where she again fell ill. She spent three months indisposed at the home of fellow Quaker John Hutchinson. She then continued to Carlow County, where she lodged at the home of Robert Lecky, and died on May 16, 1755. She was buried three days later at the Ballybrumhill burial ground near Fennagh, County Carlow, Ireland.\\n\\nSection::::Contributions to Women\\'s Writing.\\nMany scholars have discussed Ashbridge\\'s contributions to women\\'s writing, some claiming that, to some extent, her \"\\'voice remains firmly indentured\\' to the patriarchal culture in which she lives,\" and others citing her as an example of \"the importance of life-writing as a tool for female vindication in a patriarchal culture.\" Her ability to \"embrace the interactions of minds, bodies, reason, and emotion\" in her writing is often noted as a feminist way of making meaning. While her conversion to Quakerism (a more gender-equal lifestyle and belief system than she was raised with) indicates a triumph over patriarchal society, the multi-faceted way in which she makes meaning marks an important contribution to women\\'s writing in itself. In addition, Ashbridge\\'s spiritual narrative gives us an example of a woman in Early America, not only constructing her \"self\" on her terms, but also asserting that construction of her \"self\" into the world and trying to find a way to reconcile the differences presented by her own construction of herself, and the construction of women presented to her by the patriarchal culture in which she lived.\\n\\nSection::::Notability.\\nAlthough Ashbridge is not the first writer of a spiritual autobiography or the first female Quaker minister, Ashbridge is still a notable figure in early American literature and history. Her \"Account,\" according to some critics, an interesting example of feminist literature and unique female voice. The Quaker\\'s belief that men and women are equally responsible for sharing their spiritual stories was somewhat unusual among the faiths present in New England in the eighteenth century. In this way, the Quaker community challenged the dominant culture: in fact, for a time Rhode Island was the sole state in which anti-Quaker legislation did not exist.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Elizabeth Ashbridge', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7580004'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7585058', 'text': 'Taiwan saddled carpetshark\\n\\nThe Taiwan saddled carpetshark (\"Cirrhoscyllium formosanum\") is a carpetshark of the family Parascylliidae found around Taiwan, between latitudes 28Â°N and 21Â°N, at depths to 110 m.

The federal government withdrew troops from the state and ended Reconstruction that year. Chamberlain was the last Republican in that office until James B. Edwards was elected in 1974.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nChamberlain was born in West Brookfield in Worcester County in central Massachusetts, the ninth of ten children born to Eli Chamberlain and Achsah Forbes. In 1862, he graduated with honors from Yale University, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones society.\\n\\nHe attended Harvard Law School, leaving in 1863 to serve as a second lieutenant in the United States Army with the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry, a regiment of black troops. In 1866, Chamberlain moved to South Carolina to tend to the affairs of a deceased classmate.\\n\\nSection::::South Carolina politics.\\nIn 1868, Chamberlain entered politics as a delegate to the South Carolina state constitutional convention from Berkeley County. He served as state attorney general from 1868â1872 in the administration of Governor Robert K. Scott. After he failed to win the Republican nomination for governor in 1872, Chamberlain practiced law in Charleston. His partner later recalled that he worked hard for little compensation; whatever his ethics in office, he certainly had not amassed a fortune. In 1873, he was elected to the board of trustees of the University of South Carolina as the first black students were admitted and faculty hired for the institution.\\n\\nChamberlain was elected Republican governor on November 3, 1874, when he defeated John T. Green. Chamberlain received 80,403 votes (53.9%) to Green\\'s 68,818 votes (46.1%). Chamberlain\\'s reputation had been a dubious one; there certainly was evidence of a willingness to make his office pay, and possibly of corruption, in his earlier career. But by the time he became governor, he had become the representative of those Republicans convinced of the need for reformâa conviction strengthened by the notorious administration of his predecessor, Franklin J. Moses, Jr., and the national publicity given to \"The Prostrate State\", the exposure of South Carolina political conditions written by James Shepherd Pike.\\n\\nChamberlain delivered on his promises. While continuing his support of civil rights, he made war on government expenses and the high tax levels in the state. He tried to reduce all public officers\\' wages by a third and used his veto against tax rates that he considered too high. He urged that spending be cut for the lunatic asylum and that many of its inmates be shipped off to county poorhouses. Instead of paying so much for the penitentiary, he endorsed revival of the convict-lease system. There should only be half as much money for the agricultural college and an end to any state scholarship program. As for the state university, Chamberlain called for dismissing its faculty and replacing them with school teachers. \"We only want a good high school\", as he put it. His struggles over patronage pitted him against some of the leading African-American Republicans in the legislature and gave him a national reputation. It also made him deep enemies in the party. At one point, it was alleged, a senator rallied his colleagues: \"Are you going to let Chamberlain frighten you off with his cry of reform and economy? Why, gentlemen, there are five years of good stealing in South Carolina yet.\"\\n\\nEnjoying a close alliance with the Democratic editor of the \"Charleston News and Courier\", Chamberlain may have hoped for bipartisan support in his bid for re-election. It did not come. South Carolina Democrats chose to adopt a white-supremacy program, re-enforced with intimidation and the use of force against black Republican voters. The bitterly fought 1876 campaign was disrupted with mob violence and gunmen breaking up Republican campaign meetings. After Chamberlain informed President Ulysses S. Grant of the violent situation, Grant sent troops in October 1876 under General of the Army William T. Sherman to stop the violent mob action. On election night, his second term hinged on disputed votes from Laurens and Edgefield counties, where the counts greatly exceeded the total population. These overwhelmingly favored his opponent, ex-Confederate Wade Hampton, III.\\n\\nThrough the winter, Chamberlain and Hampton both claimed to lead the lawful government, but Chamberlain\\'s found it nearly impossible to raise the money or military force to function beyond the rooms in which it met. Chamberlain left South Carolina in April 1877 when President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew Federal troops to barracks from their place protecting the Republican government and ended the interventions that had taken place intermittently in the state since the Civil War. Embittered, Chamberlain blamed the President for having betrayed the mass of South Carolina\\'s voters; the population was 58% African American. In later years, however, he grew disillusioned with Reconstruction and contended that letting black people vote had been a mistake.\\n\\nSection::::Later years.\\nChamberlain moved to New York City and became a successful Wall Street attorney. He was a professor of constitutional law at Cornell University from 1883 until 1897. Chamberlain authored the 1902 book \"Charles Sumner and the Treaty of Washington\", as well as numerous articles.\\n\\nUpon his retirement, he traveled extensively in Europe. He moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he died of cancer on April 13, 1907.

Born and educated in Germany, he was forced in 1935 to emigrate to Switzerland, which he adopted as his home country. His speciality was in the religious content of ancient art, which he interpreted from a perspective informed by the scientific tradition and shaped by the poetic tradition of the German classical period and the ideals of the poet Stefan George.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nAfter attending high school at the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, he began his study of the ancient world at TÃ¼bingen and Heidelberg. He met his future wife, Marianne von den Steinen, there. He went on to study at Jena, and in 1930 completed his doctorate at Marburg under the supervision of Paul Jacobsthal. Later he worked especially at the German Archaeological Institute in Rome and Athens, and participated in excavations at Larisa in Thessaly.\\n\\nHe was married on 5 February 1935 to Marianne von den Steinen, daughter of Karl von den Steinen, a well-known ethnologist. Concerned by developments in Germany, he moved to Basel the same year, and there completed his \"Habilitation\" in classical archaeology. At first, he specialised in near-eastern and early-Christian archaeology. After the death of Ernst Pfuhl in 1940, he gradually became more and more responsible for all areas of teaching and finally, in 1953, the chair was transferred to him. He declined numerous appointments in other countries; through his research, and the foundation of a museum of antiquities, he developed the field of archaeology at Basel.\\n\\nSchefold was a member of the German, Austrian, and American archaeological institutes, and of the Bavarian and British Academy of Sciences. He held an honorary doctorate at the University of Thessaloniki. With Herbert A. Cahn he founded the Antikenmuseum Basel, the first museum for ancient art in Switzerland.\\n\\nHe had at three sons, Dian Schefold, Professor for public law in Bremen, Germany, Reimar Schefold, Professor for cultural anthropology, who lives in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Bertram Schefold, Professor for Economics in Frankfurt, Germany.\\n\\nSection::::Work.\\nSchefold was known for his work on late-classical Attic vases, on the art of the Scythians in southern Russia, and his excavations at Larisa and Eretria.

For the period 1876â1892, he ranks behind only Cap Anson in career major league games played (1644), hits (2146), at-bats (6884), doubles (392) and total bases (2936), and behind only Harry Stovey in runs scored (1370) (Stovey was a younger player; Anson played five seasons and O\\'Rourke four prior to 1876.).\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nO\\'Rourke was born in East Bridgeport, Connecticut, and worked on his family\\'s farm while playing youth league and semi-pro baseball. He began his professional career as a member of the Middletown Mansfields in 1872, joining the one-year-old National Association team as a catcher. The Mansfields were not a top-tier team, and folded in August, but O\\'Rourke had impressed other teams sufficiently enough to be offered a contract with the Boston Red Stockings, with whom he played until 1878. On April 22, 1876, O\\'Rourke had the first base hit in National League history.\\n\\nHe graduated from Yale Law School in 1887 with an LL.B., practicing law in Bridgeport between early playing stints, and earning the nickname \"Orator Jim\" because of his verbosity on the field, his intellect, and his law degreeâuncommon in a game regarded as a rough immigrant sport at the time.\\n\\nAfter leaving the major leagues following the 1893 season he continued to play in the minor leagues until he was over 50 years old. As an executive of the Bridgeport team in the Connecticut League, in 1895 O\\'Rourke hired the first African American minor league baseball player in history.\\n\\nIn 1904, he made a final appearance with the New York Giants under manager and friend John McGraw, becoming at age 54 the oldest player ever to appear in the National League, and the oldest player to hit safely in a major league game. O\\'Rourke is one of only 29 players in baseball history to appear in Major League games in four decades.\\n\\nIn 1912, he returned to the field to catch a complete minor league game at the age of 60.\\n\\nO\\'Rourke died of pneumonia at age 68 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as one of the earliest inductees from the 19th century. His older brother John O\\'Rourke and his son James \"Queenie\" O\\'Rourke also played in the majors.\\n\\nOne legend concerning O\\'Rourke is that he was asked to drop the \"O\\'\" from his last name when he signed a contract with Boston and its Protestant backers. The son of Irish immigrants and the husband of a woman born in Ireland, O\\'Rourke refused, saying \"I would rather die than give up my father\\'s name. A million dollars would not tempt me.\"\\n\\nAnother legend about O\\'Rourke is that his signing by the Mansfields in 1872 was conditioned on the team finding someone to take over O\\'Rourke\\'s chores on his parents\\' farm.\\n\\nSection::::External links.\\n, or Retrosheet\\n', 'title': \"Jim O'Rourke (baseball)\", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759214'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'bQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '759514', 'text': 'Cowhill, Gloucestershire\\n\\nCowhill is a small village south of Oldbury, South Gloucestershire, England.

As part of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Acute Services Review, the centre is being centralised within new facilities at the Gartnavel General Hospital site.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Glasgow Cancer and Skin Institution, which had been founded at 400 St Vincent Street in 1886, acquired a house at 163 Hill Street in 1890. A ten-bed hospital was established to treat cancer patients. In 1893, Dr. George Beatson (who as Sir George Beatson KCB, KBE later served as President of the Scottish Red Cross Society), was appointed surgeon to the hospital. The following year, the Glasgow Cancer Hospital, the first of its kind in Scotland, was established, together with an outdoor dispensary, at 22 West Graham Street. A domiciliary nursing service was set up at the same time to care for cancer patients in their own homes.\\n\\nIn 1896 new premises, which could accommodate 30 beds, were acquired at 132 Hill Street. In the same year Beatson published his landmark paper in The Lancet, a report of three patients with breast cancer whom he had treated by bilateral oophorectomy. This work forms the basis of the current anti-hormonal treatment of breast cancer and the operation is still performed today. In 1912, HRH Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, opened the rebuilt facilities which were named the Royal Glasgow Cancer Hospital. In the same year a research department was founded and the first director of research (Dr. Charles Walker) was appointed, making the institute one of the oldest \"Comprehensive Cancer Centers\" in the world.\\n\\nWith the inception of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, the hospital came under control of the Western Board of Management, and was renamed the Royal Beatson Memorial Hospital in 1953. In 1967, the Research Laboratories were renamed the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, which continued to occupy the upper floors of the hospital until 1977, when they moved to a new site at Garscube Estate (renamed the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in 2013). The clinical section moved to a new centre within the Western Infirmary and was named the Beatson Oncology Centre.\\n\\nIn 2007, the Beatson Oncology Centre, which was by that time spread over four hospitals (Western Infirmary, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Stobhill Hospital) moved to a newly built Cancer Hospital, The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre.\\n\\nSection::::Support.\\nThe BWSCC was supported by charities Friends of the Beatson and The Beatson Oncology Centre Fund. In 2014 through a restructuring, and in partnership with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the resources of both charities dedicated to supporting the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre have combined to form a unitary charity to support and serve the Beatson.

Lightering is undertaken to reduce a vessel\\'s draft in order to enter port facilities which cannot accept very large ocean-going vessels. Lightering can also refer to the use of a lighter barge for any form of short-distance transport, such as to bring railroad cars across a river. In addition, lightering can refer to the process of removing oil or other hazardous chemicals from a compromised vessel to another vessel to prevent oil from spilling into the surrounding waters.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nLightering was practiced for all types of cargo for centuries. Prior to the 19th century introduction of steamships too large to enter some of the ports they intended to serve, in which case lightering became necessary to reduce the vessels\\' draft sufficiently to enter the port, cargoes ranging from water to ships\\'s stores (food, livestock, misc. supplies), to gunpowder and shot, were carried from dockside to sailing ships moored in harbors and roadways. Dredging, advances in dock construction, and containerization have reduced the frequency of the practice in dry bulk shipping after the middle of the 20th century. However, the practice remains in common usage in the oil tanking industry (\"wet\" cargo trade).\\n\\nSection::::Modern process.\\nSection::::Wet bulk.\\nLightering for tankers typically occurs in the EEZ, generally between and from the shore, and can be performed while the ships are at anchor, drifting, or underway. The product is typically transferred using specialized hoses which offload cargo from the larger vessel to the smaller. Fenders are used to separate the two ships moored to each other and prevent damage while the cargo is being transferred.\\n\\nSection::::Dry bulk.\\nIn many developing nations, such as China and especially India, dry bulk vessels still often lighter in order to meet draft restrictions at ports that either do not have natural deep water access or whose channels have yet to be dredged to sufficient depth to allow some of the larger-size bulk carriers to safely transit.\\n\\nIn dry bulk, lightering can be undertaken one of two ways. If the vessel to be lightered is geared, then it can discharge cargo to smaller, ungeared vessels (typically barges). If the vessel to be lightered is gearless, then floating cranes are often used to transfer cargo to another vessel or barge. A roll-on/roll-off discharge facility, a floating platform, can also be used to connect the vessels.\\n\\nAlso, although not very common, vessels will sometimes lighter before (or even between) berthings, shifting to shallower berths in order to discharge more quickly and also free up space for larger vessels.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Lightering', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7616809'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ewE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '761742', 'text': 'Fiesta Songs\\n\\nFiesta Songs is a 2003 album by SeÃ±or Coconut Y Su Conjunto (Uwe Schmidt).

The franchise is based on the idea of an alien EinsteinâRosen bridge device (the Stargate) that enables nearly instantaneous travel across the cosmos. The franchise began with the film \"Stargate\", released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197\\xa0million worldwide. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled \"Stargate SG-1\" as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by \"Stargate Atlantis\" in 2004, \"Stargate Universe\" in 2009, and a prequel web series, \"Stargate Origins\", in 2018. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies \"Stargate: Children of the Gods\", \"\", and \"\", which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.\\n\\nIn 2011, \"Stargate Universe\", the last \"Stargate\" program on television, ended its run. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions. In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new \"Stargate Atlantis\" stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new \"Stargate Universe\" comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show. The predominant story arc thus ran on television for 15 years, including 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming, and 8 comic book issues as of July 2017. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main continuity or resets it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series \"Stargate Infinity.\"\\n\\nIn 2017, the franchise was revived with the announcement of a new prequel web series, \"Stargate Origins\". Episodes premiered on a central \"fan hub\" for the franchise called Stargate Command, with a first season of ten 10-minute episodes.\\n\\nSection::::Premise.\\n\"Stargate\" productions center on the premise of a \"Stargate,\" a ring-shaped portal that enables rapid transportation to other stargates located cosmic distances away. The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a unified \"United Nation\"-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.\\n\\nCombined with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, \"Stargate\" productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the present day on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of forced deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that most ancient mythologies are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in the unproven ancient astronaut hypothesis).\\n\\nThe longest-running series, \"Stargate SG-1\" sets the context having the \"Milky Way\" galaxy as a failed state in which Goa\\'uld System Lords war against each other, due to the death of Ra in the film undermining the existing social structure of the System Lords due to Ra\\'s status as the Supreme System Lord. Goa\\'uld used superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy (with evidence suggesting that most Goa\\'uld believe their propaganda); these people are kept in poverty, ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts. Only a small portion of stargate dial numbers do not lead to planets dominated by the Goa\\'uld.\\n\\nSection::::Franchise releases.\\nDue to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various \"Stargate\" productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official canon, the largest following exists for the three live-action series. Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their predecessor).\\n\\n\\nSection::::Theatrical films.\\nSection::::\"Stargate\".\\nIn 1994, the military science fiction feature film \"Stargate\" was released, directed by Roland Emmerich and co-written by Emmerich and Dean Devlin. The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.\\n\\nThe film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in Giza in 1928. In a present day, \"i.e.\", 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the cover stones of the Stargate are asterisms used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel Jack O\\'Neil (Kurt Russell) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with his knowledge of the coordinate system. The team discovers a slave civilization serving an alien who is posing as the Egyptian god Ra (Jaye Davidson). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O\\'Neil\\'s team is eventually able to instigate a slave rebellion, overwhelming Ra\\'s forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O\\'Neil is able to teleport a nuclear warhead on-board Ra\\'s ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O\\'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named Sha\\'uri.\\n\\nSection::::Other releases and possible future development.\\nAfter Bill McCay had written a series of five novels continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the \"Stargate\" television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that \"he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original\" According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together. \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\" producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that \"Devlin can wish to do a sequel to \"Stargate\" all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they\\'ll ask him to do it. He knows better.\"\\n\\nPlans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film\\'s creator Dean Devlin at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con. He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist Kurt Russell and James Spader in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. \"They\\'ve always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely.\" These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" if they are ever produced.\\n\\nDean Devlin spoke out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn\\'t given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three. His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three.\\n\\nDevlin has said \"I think it\\'ll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed.\" \"We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist â and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger.\" It was announced that MGM and Warner Bros. are partnering with both Emmerich and Devlin for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing and Devlin producing. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot of a potential new series are stalled.\\n\\nSection::::Television.\\nSection::::\"SG-1\".\\nIn 1997, Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright co-developed \"Stargate SG-1\", a television series intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O\\'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra \"L\"). The Stargate Command setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Other variations and differences between the original film and \"SG-1\" mostly concern the location of the planet Abydos, the alien Ra, the race of Ra\\'s underlings (Jaffa), and Stargate travel.\\n\\nThe series debuted on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and moved to the Sci-Fi Channel after its fifth season. It starred Richard Dean Anderson (as O\\'Neill) and Michael Shanks (as Jackson), alongside Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis respectively playing the new characters Samantha Carter, Teal\\'c and George Hammond. The cast remained fairly regular for most of \"SG-1\"\\'s run, but experienced some changes. Michael Shanks left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn. Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 Davis left the show and Anderson filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of Anderson, but added new regulars Beau Bridges and Ben Browder. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, Claudia Black\\'s popular reception earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.\\n\\nMGM put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises. \"SG-1\" was taken off air in 2007; however, two direct-to-DVD movies entitled \"The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum\" were made to tie up loose ends.\\n\\nIn June 2009, \"Children of the Gods\", \"Stargate SG-1\"\\'s pilot episode, was re-cut into a \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD movie with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version.\\n\\nSection::::\"Atlantis\".\\nThe \"Stargate Atlantis\" series follows the adventures of the \"Atlantis expedition\", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the Pegasus Galaxy in search of the Lost City of Atlantis, left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the Ancients, also known as Lanteans and Alterans. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of \"SG-1\"\\'s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the \"SG-1\" setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discovers Atlantis rests at the bottom of an ocean, protected by shields keeping the City habitable. As the Atlantis Expedition Team explores the myriad corridors and equipment, they quickly drain the already nearly depleted power source (known as a ZPM) allowing the shields to hold and Atlantis remain watertight. As an emergency default \"programme\", Atlantis detects this sudden power drop, activates a failsafe, the City surfaces, and appears as an island in the middle of an ocean.\\n\\nUsing small ships discovered in the City, Team Members fly and discover the mainland, where they explore, meet the Indigenous Population, and learn that the Pegasus Galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the \"Wraith.\" Although first encountered whilst in a long-term hibernation state, the Expedition unintentionally and prematurely wakes the Wraith, alerting them to the reemergence of Atlantis, a new race of humans, and a potential new feeding ground: The Milky Way Galaxy. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Team must defend and protect the City, the Locals, and the entire Expedition. \\n\\n\"Stargate Atlantis\" was a spin-off television series from \"Stargate SG-1\". A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of \"SG-1\". Later, \"SG-1\" was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season. Finally, when \"SG-1\" was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part season finale episode \"Lost City\", and the setting of \"Stargate Atlantis\" was moved to the Pegasus galaxy. This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same fictional universe, and later the two shows even become interconnected. \"Atlantis\" was developed by most of the same people and in the same studios as \"SG-1\".\\n\\n\"Atlantis\" debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring Joe Flanigan and Torri Higginson in the lead roles, with Rainbow Sun Francks, David Hewlett, and Rachel Luttrell alongside. Hewlett and Higginson\\'s characters had previously appeared in \"SG-1\" (though Higginson inherited the role from actress Jessica Steen). In \"Atlantis\"\\' second season, Paul McGillion and Jason Momoa (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and Jewel Staite in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for season five to concentrate on \"Sanctuary\", and was replaced by Robert Picardo, who reprised his role as Richard Woolsey from both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\". However, in late summer 2008 it was announced that SciFi would not renew \"Atlantis\". The final episode aired on January 9, 2009.\\n\\nSection::::\"Universe\".\\n\"Stargate Universe\" is the third live-action \"Stargate\" series, and premiered on October 2, 2009. The series was pitched to the Sci Fi Channel in the fall of 2007, just before the writer\\'s strikeâwhich put a hold on the project. \"The pitch was received very well,\" according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. Sci Fi Channel ordered \"Universe\" after announcing the cancellation of \"Stargate Atlantis\". Syfy announced on December 16, 2010 that they would not pick the show up for a third season. The final episode aired May 9, 2011.\\n\\nAfter the events of \"Stargate Atlantis\", research into the Stargate\\'s 9th and final chevron leads to an expedition being stranded several billion light years from earth on board an Ancient ship called \"Destiny\" which has been traveling through the universe unmanned for millions of years. The show follows the crew as they struggle to survive on board \"Destiny\" with no apparent way home. The show was intended to have a darker tone than its predecessors and delve more into the humanity of the characters and their relationships with each other.\\n\\nSection::::\"The Ark of Truth, Continuum & Children of the Gods\".\\n\"\" is a direct-to-DVD movie written and directed by Robert C.

The movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008. The Region 4 DVD was released on August 6, 2008 with the Region 2 DVD released on August 18, 2008; followed by possible TV broadcasts. The film is a time-travel adventure and is the second sequel to \"Stargate SG-1\", after \"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\".\\n\\n\"Stargate: Children of the Gods\" is a direct-to-DVD movie written by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright and directed by Mario Azzopardi.\\nThe \"Stargate SG-1\" pilot episode was re-cut as a third \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD special and released on July 21, 2009 in format. A few months before its release, executive producer Brad Wright announced it was to have with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version. The beginning was to be slightly altered, a new scene added, and the nudity scene taken out to make this episode suitable for children, with the final movie roughly seven minutes shorter than the original episode.\\n\\nSection::::Post-\"Universe\" cancellation.\\nIn April 2009, MGM confirmed a third \"SG-1\" film that Brad Wright had first announced in May 2008. Wright was set to co-write the film with former \"Stargate Atlantis\" executive producer Carl Binder, with Martin Wood serving as director. According to Wright, the film would center on the Jack O\\'Neill character and reunite as many of the \"SG-1\" cast as possible, depending on the cost of the film and actor availability. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) had confirmed his and Richard Dean Anderson\\'s participation. Amanda Tapping confirmed her appearance in the third SG-1 film and the first \"Atlantis\" movie. According to Wright, the character of Vala Mal Doran would not appear in this film. The working title for the film, \"\" was revealed by Joseph Mallozzi in his blog.\\n\\nAccording to Sci-Fi and Joseph Mallozzi, a \"Stargate Atlantis\" two-hour direct-to-DVD movie was given the go ahead after the series was cancelled at the end of its fifth season. More movies were expected to follow in the Atlantis series if the first movie was successful. The rumored working title for the film was \"Stargate Extinction\". By May 2009 the script for the film was finished.\\n\\nOn April 17, 2011, \"Stargate\" writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced that the \"SGU\" movie is not going to happen. He also confirmed that the proposed \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" movies have been permanently shelved, along with another movie idea he had been trying to get a greenlight on that would have involved cast members of all three series. Still, Wright did not rule out future \"Stargate\" films, saying; \"It\\'s a franchise. \"Stargate\" is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out, and something will happen.\"\\n\\nIn May 2014, MGM announced a re-imagined version of the original 1994 film to be produced as a trilogy with Warner Bros. Pictures. Emmerich will direct and Devlin will produce. This set of two sequel films to the original \"Stargate\" starring Kurt Russell and James Spader will take a dramatically different course than the \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" universe created in the following 15 years. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot and potential new series are stalled.\\n\\nSection::::\"Stargate Origins\".\\nIn July 2017, a web series called \"Stargate Origins\" was announced at a San Diego Comic Con Panel celebrating the franchise\\'s 20th anniversary. It focuses on the character of Catherine Langford and is a prequel to both the television continuity and the original feature film. The shooting began in August 2017 and series premiered online at the Stargate Command website on February 14, 2018.\\n\\nThe cast includes Ellie Gall as the young Catherine Langford, Connor Trinneer as Catherine\\'s father, Professor Paul Langford, Aylam Orian as Dr. Wilhelm BrÃ¼cke, a high-ranking Nazi officer, Philip Alexander as Captain James Beal, British officer stationed in Egypt., and Shvan Aladdin as Wasif, a native Egyptian and a lieutenant in the British army.\\n\\nSection::::\"Infinity\".\\n\"Stargate Infinity\" is an American animated science fiction television series created by Eric Lewald and Michael Maliani as a spin-off from its sister show, \"Stargate SG-1\". The story arc in \"Infinity\" is set 30 years into the future and follows Gus Bonner and his team. Bonner\\'s team was created after he was framed for a crime he did not commit. He escaped from Stargate Command (SGC) after the hostile alien race Tlak\\'kahn attacked the SGC to find the chrysalis. Together with his team he escapes through the Stargate with the chrysalis. From that point forward they go from planet to planet until they find the evidence to clear their names while learning about the unique cultures in the galaxy, so that they can one day return to Earth. The story arc was never resolved because of low viewership ratings and the show was cancelled in 2003.\\n\\n\"Stargate Infinity\" premiered in September 2002 as part of 4Kids Entertainmentâs FOX BOX Saturday morning line-up on FOX and went off the air in June 2003. Due to its lack of popularity the show is almost completely unrecognized. The series was cancelled before any of its story arcs could be resolved. The show was of low budget, which was constantly noted by the media. DIC Entertainment released a 4-episode DVD on October 7, 2003 in Region 1. MGM Home Entertainment released a five disc season box set on August 13, 2007 in region 2. Shout! Factory, a company known for releasing cult animated series, acquired the rights to the show and released the entire series to DVD on May 13, 2008 in Region 1. , there is yet to come a release of \"Stargate Infinity\" package in Region 4, namely Oceania and Latin America.\\n\\nThe writers and producers of \"Stargate SG-1\", \"Stargate Atlantis\" and \"Stargate Universe\" and the main canon of the \"Stargate\" franchise were not involved with \"Infinity\", and neither MGM, the production teams nor the fans of \"Stargate\" consider \"Infinity\" to be an official part of the \"Stargate\" universe. According to \"Stargate SG-1\" co-creator Brad Wright, the animated series should not be considered official \"Stargate\" canon. Commenting on it, he stated, \"I don\\'t have a problem with it. I\\'m just not involved.\"\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\n\"Stargate\" took in $16.7\\xa0million on its opening weekend, and received mixed reactions from critics; while it was panned by some critics such as Roger Ebert, several positive reviews counterbalanced this leading to a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although the film was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films, Emmerich and Devlin ultimately moved on to produce \"Independence Day\", and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels. In the intervening time, copyright-holder MGM succeeded the film with the television series \"Stargate SG-1\" without the input of Emmerich and Devlin.\\n\\n\"Stargate SG-1\" has won the Saturn Award for \"Best Syndicated Television Series\" on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting. More recently it has received acclaim for its visual effects, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget. On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that it would not be renewing \"Stargate SG-1\" for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the Nielsen ratings. Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating websites in reaction to exhibit their commitment to the series. Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of \"SG-1\" are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told the fansite GateWorld exclusively that he was working to continue \"SG-1\". Currently, no network or company has ordered new episodes of \"SG-1\", so the show is on hold until a new buyer can be found. However, SciFi has attempted to block other networks from taking up the show, citing its original exclusive contract with MGM. \"Atlantis\" proved to be as successful as \"SG-1\", with Nielsen ratings and viewership. The \"Stargate\" franchise in 2009 won a Constellation Award in the category of Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in 2008.\\n\\nThe average viewership to \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" was around 10\\xa0million a week worldwide. According to \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" co-creator Brad Wright, the show is popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in homeland Canada. It was estimated that around 30\\xa0million \"Stargate\" DVDs were sold worldwide in 2006.\\n\\nThe DVD release of \"\" in the US earned MGM/Fox US $1.59\\xa0million in rentals in the first week after the release, and another US $1.38\\xa0million in rentals in the second week. In its third week it earned US $1.19\\xa0million in rentals totaling US $4.16\\xa0million. The DVD has also earned US $9.0\\xa0million in sales. \"\" would go on to gross over $8\\xa0million United States dollars in the United States. The film sparked mostly positive reviews with movie critics. A third \"Stargate SG-1\" movie was planned to follow \"Continuum\", but the third movie was put on hold with any other future Stargate movies; the film would have centered around the character of Jack O\\'Neill.\\n\\nSection::::Literature.\\nThere are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original \"Stargate\" film and two based in the \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\" television shows. A series of books written by Bill McCay were published from 1995 to 1999 that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film \"would have gone\". Neither party has commented on whether McCay\\'s interpretation was correct. Despite attempting to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series \"Stargate SG-1\" (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.\\n\\nFrom 1999 to 2001, ROC published four novels based in \"Stargate SG-1\" written by Ashley McConnell. In 2004, UK-based Fandemonium Press started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on \"Stargate SG-1\". Due to the conflict with ROC\\'s license, these books were available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006. The official \"Stargate Magazine\", produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\".\\n\\nA series of comic books, based on \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\", began to be published by Avatar Press in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by James Anthony and artwork by Jorge Correa. In February 2008 it was announced that Big Finish Productions would release officially licensed audiobooks featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are \"Gift of the Gods\" read by Michael Shanks and \"A Necessary Evil\" read by Torri Higginson.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Stargate', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762849', 'cat_id': '762849', 'cat_title': 'Destroyers_of_the_Royal_Norwegian_Navy', 'cat_pages': '10', 'cat_subcats': '6', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'fwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '763125', 'text': 'Kronstadt\\n\\nKronstadt ( ), also spelled Kronshtadt, Cronstadt or KronÅ¡tÃ¡dt (from for \"crown\" and \"Stadt\" for \"city\"; ) is an early 18th-century foundation which became an important international centre of commerce whose trade role was eclipsed by the growth of its strategic significance in the ensuing centuries as the primary maritime defence outpost of the former Russian capital. It is now the port city in Kronshtadtsky District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, Russia, located on Kotlin Island, west of Saint Petersburg, near the head of the Gulf of Finland. It is linked to the former Russian capital by a combination levee-causeway-seagate, the St Petersburg Dam, part of the city\\'s flood defences, which also acts as road access to Kotlin island from the mainland. In March 1921, the island city was the site of the Kronstadt rebellion.\\n\\nThe main base of the Russian Baltic Fleet was located in Kronstadt guarding the approaches to Saint Petersburg. The historic centre of the city and its fortifications are part of the World Heritage Site that is \"Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments\".\\n\\nKronstadt has been a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox Christians for many years due to the memory of Saint John of Kronstadt.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Foundation.\\nKronstadt was founded by Peter the Great, whose Imperial Russian forces took the island of Kotlin from the Swedes during the Great Northern War in 1703. The first fortifications were inaugurated on . These fortifications, known as (ÐÑÐ¾Ð½ÑÐ»Ð¾Ñ), were constructed very quickly. During the winter the Gulf of Finland freezes over completely. Under the command of Governor-general Alexander Danilovich Menshikov, workers used thousands of frames made of oak logs filled with stones which were carried by horses across the frozen sea, and placed in cuttings made in the ice. Thus, several new small islands were created, and forts were erected on them, virtually closing access to Saint-Petersburg by sea. Only two narrow navigable channels remained, with forts guarding them.\\n\\nOne of the first Governors of Kronstadt was a veteran of the Royal Scots Navy, Admiral Thomas Gordon who was a refugee in Russia from the Scottish union with England and became Commander-in-chief from 1727 to 1741.\\n\\nJust as Kronstadt became populated and fortified, it attracted merchants from maritime powers most notably, the Dutch, the British and the Germans through the old \"Hanse\" connections. The community of British merchants or \"factors\" came to be known as the \"English Factory\", despite the fact that many of them were Scots. They settled both in Kronstadt and in St Petersburg itself and for a time dominated both inward and outward trade, especially in the reign of Catherine the Great. They became an integral part of British trade and foreign policy through the Board of Trade in London. A number of the British settlers became naturalised Russians. Trading alliances were sharply interrupted by the outbreak of the Crimean War (1854).\\n\\nKronstadt was thoroughly refortified in the 19th century. The old three-decker forts, five in number, which formerly constituted the principal defences of the place and had resisted the Anglo-French fleets during the Crimean War, became of secondary importance. From the plans of Eduard Totleben a new fort, \"Constantine\", and four batteries were constructed (1856â1871) to defend the principal approach, and seven batteries to cover the shallower northern channel. All these fortifications were low and thickly armoured earthworks with heavy Krupp guns on their ramparts. The city is surrounded by an enceinte.\\n\\nIn summer 1891, the French fleet was officially received in Kronstadt. It was a first step towards the forthcoming Franco-Russian Alliance.\\n\\nSection::::Russian Civil War.\\nDuring the Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) riots of the February revolution, the sailors of Petrograd joined the revolution and executed their officers, thus gaining a reputation as dedicated revolutionaries. During the civil war, the sailors participated on the \"red side\", until 1921, when they rebelled against Bolshevik rule.\\n\\nKronstadt with its supporting forts and minefields was key in protecting Petrograd from foreign forces. Despite this, the cruiser \"Oleg\" was torpedoed and sunk by a small motor boat after participating in the bombardment of Krasnaya Gorka fort that had revolted against the Bolsheviks. This was followed on August 18, 1919, by a raid of seven Royal Navy Coastal Motor Boats inside the harbour of Kronstadt itself, damaging the Soviet battleships and \"Andrei Pervozvanny\", and sinking a submarine supply ship, the .\\n\\nSection::::Kronstadt Rebellion.\\nIn 1921, a group of naval officers and men, together with soldiers and civilian supporters, rebelled against the Bolshevik government in Soviet Kronstadt. The garrison had previously been a centre of major support for the Bolsheviks, and throughout the Civil War of 1917â1921, the naval forces at Kronstadt had been at the vanguard of the main Bolshevik attacks. Their demands included freedom of speech, the end of deportation to work camps, a change in Soviet war politics, and liberation of the soviets (workers\\' councils) from \"party control\". After brief negotiations, Leon Trotsky (then the Minister of War in the Soviet Government, and the leader of the Red Army) responded by sending the army to Kronstadt, along with the Cheka. The uprising was thus suppressed.\\n\\nSection::::World War II.\\nIn the late 1930s, the fortified city became the base of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. During that time it was an important training centre for the Soviet navy. The Kronstadt naval dockyard overhauled and repaired surface ships and submarines for the Baltic Fleet. All forts and batteries of the city were reconstructed.\\n\\nAt 23:37 on June 21, 1941, fleet operational readiness Number 1 was announced by Baltic Fleet Commander Vice Admiral V. Tributs on the order of the People\\'s Commissar of the Navy Admiral N.G. Kuznetsov. Several hours later the first German aircraft began dropping mines into the canal outside Kronstadt. The duty officer, first lieutenant S. Kushnerev, ordered anti-aircraft batteries to open fire on enemy planes. Several aircraft were shot down or damaged. Twenty-seven German planes took part in the first attack, and three were destroyed by the anti-aircraft guns of the 1st Air Defence Regiment of the Baltic Fleet. This regiment was situated in the southern forts.\\n\\nDuring World War II, Kronstadt was subject to several bombing raids by the Luftwaffe. In August 1941 the Luftwaffe began bombing Kronstadt repeatedly. The most notable bombing was Stuka ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel\\'s sinking of the \"Marat\".\\n\\nTo prevent an enemy landing, 13 artillery batteries were established in Kronstadt with nine more batteries outside the city, on the island of Kotlin. The main lookout was located in the \"Naval Cathedral\". Visual range reached . The coastal defence forces of Kronstadt included two infantry regiments.\\n\\nIn late August, the Red Army in the Baltic States was in a critical situation. Tallinn, the main base of the fleet, was in danger and an order to relocate the fleet from Tallinn to Kronstadt was given. By the time the Soviets had decided on a maritime evacuation of Tallinn, over 200 Soviet civilian and military vessels had been assembled in Tallinn harbour.\\n\\nAfter the evacuation of Tallinn, a submarine subdivision had been organized in Kronstadt. By the end of 1941, 82 naval operations had taken place. Hitler was enraged, because Soviet submarines frequently disrupted military supplies of strategic materials from Sweden to Germany. The Germans tried to block the exit completely from the Gulf of Finland with anti-submarine nets and mines. Despite these efforts, the Soviet submariners continued to attack German ships. In 1942, 29 German vessels were sunk. Submarines cooperated with reconnaissance aircraft in searching for military targets.\\n\\nSoviet submarines had broken through the mine barrages in the Gulf of Finland in 1942. To keep the Soviet submarine force away from Baltic shipping stronger efforts were planned. The minefields would be larger and in addition a double submarine net would be laid from Porkkala to Naissaar in \"Operation Walross\". The blockade of the Gulf of Finland turned out to be 100% effective. But in 1944, when Finland signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, one of the conditions was that the Soviets could locate one naval base in Finland at Porkkala. Submarine warfare in the Baltic Sea reached its final stage after peace was reached with Finland.\\n\\nThe Baltic Fleet sent more than 125,000 people to serve on shore at the front. Eighty-three thousand people fought directly on the Leningrad Front. For the protection of Leningrad 10 brigades of marines, four regiments, and more than 40 separate battalions and companies were formed in Kronstadt.\\n\\nThe Luftwaffe and German artillery sent thousands of bombs and shells onto the naval dockyard and the Arsenal factory. The German air raids in September 1941, damaged ships of the Baltic Fleet and the infrastructure of the naval dockyard. Several sections of the yard were destroyed, the docks were heavily bombed causing the death of dozens of workers and engineers. Nevertheless, the naval yard continued its work. Despite the siege, the workers persevered with their work, often working 18â20 hours a day.\\n\\nThanks to the power of the Kronstadt Fortress the destruction of Leningrad, then the main industrial and cultural centre of the Soviet Union, was successfully prevented. The honorary status of \"City of Military Glory\" was conferred on it by the President of the Russian Federation Dmitriy Medvedev on April 27, 2009, citing the \"courage, endurance and mass heroism, exhibited by defenders of the city in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Motherland\".\\n\\nSection::::Population.\\nWith changing historical trends, the population saw peaks and troughs partly determined by the expansion and then decline of the naval base and dockyard.\\n\\nRecent population data indicate it has stabilised as follows: \\n\\nSection::::Places of interest.\\nThe city of Kronstadt is built on level ground on the island and is thus exposed to flooding, most notably in 1824. The port is ice-bound for 140â160 days in the year, from the beginning of December to April. A very large proportion of the inhabitants are sailors. On the south side of the city there are three harbours: the large western or merchant harbour, the western flank of which is formed by a great pier joining the fortifications which traverse the breadth of the island on one side. The middle harbour was used chiefly for fitting out and repairing vessels. The eastern or military harbour was used for docking vessels of the Russian Navy. The Peter and Catherine Canals connected with the merchant and middle harbours across the city. Between them stood the old \"Italian Palace\" of Prince Menshikov, whose site was later occupied by a school for pilots. In the second half of the 18th century the building of the former Italian palace was used by various military training institutions. In 1771â1798 the Sea Cadet Corps was housed there before being transferred to St Petersburg. From 1798 to 1872 the Navigation School was situated in the former palace.\\nThe Kronstadt tide gauge is situated near the former Italian palace. Sea level observations in Saint Petersburg began already in 1703. On Kotlin Island, the main naval fortress of the Russian Empire began observations in 1707. This monitoring was necessary because the water level of the Finnish Gulf could change considerably in a short time, creating problems for shipping. The annual flood also required close monitoring of the water level. The Kronstadt sea-gauge with the tide gauge pavilion is the zero level of the Baltic system of highs and lows. All depths and altitudes (even the heights of spacecraft) in Russia and some other countries of the former Russian Empire are measured according to the Kronstadt sea-gauge. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, said in 1967 that it was \"the Hub of the Universe\".\\n\\nThe modern city\\'s most striking landmark is considered to be the enormous Naval Cathedral, dedicated to St Nicholas and built between 1908 and 1913 in Anchor Square which also contains many military memorials. The Cathedral is regarded as the culmination of Russian Neo-Byzantine architecture.\\nThe Pyotrovsky Gardens is a park that surrounds the monument to Peter the Great who founded the city.\\nThere are a number of historic buildings, such as the \"Dutch Kitchen\" and the former \"Italian Palace\", that recall the city\\'s mercantile and military past. \\nAmong other public buildings are the Naval Hospital, the British Seamen\\'s Hospital (established in 1867), the Civic Hospital, the Admiralty (founded in 1785), the arsenal, dockyards and foundries, the School of Marine Engineering, and the English Church. \\n\\nThe Kronstadt port was considered the most fortified one in the world. It still retains some of its old \"forts\" on small fortified artificial islands. Originally, there were 22 such forts, situated in line with the southern and northern shores of the Gulf of Finland. Some fortifications were located inside the city itself and one was on the western shore of Kronslot Island, on the other side of the main navigational channel.\\n\\nThe construction of the Saint Petersburg Dam led to some of the forts being demolished. The dam, a \"levee-causeway-Seagate combination\" also enabled Kronstadt and some of the forts being reached by land. Among the most important surviving forts are:\\n\\n\\nThere are daily bus and water tours to Kronstadt from Saint Petersburg.\\n\\nSection::::Devotion to St. John of Kronstadt.\\nThe now demolished older St Andrew Cathedral(1817), once a prominent Kronstadt landmark, was destroyed on Communist orders in 1932. St John of Kronstadt, one of the most venerated Russian saints, served there as priest from 1855 to 1908.\\n\\nSection::::Saint Petersburg Dam.\\nThe controversial dam that took 30 years to build (1980â2011) now links Kotlin island to the mainland from north and south, not only acts as part of the flood defences, but lets through shipping and completes the St Petersburg ring-road system, across the island. It is a feat of marine engineering consisting of a combination of levee-causeway and seagate. Its construction on the shoals of the Gulf of Finland involved the removal of some of the historic fortifications.\\n\\nSection::::International relations.\\nSection::::Twin towns and sister cities.\\nKronstadt is twinned with:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kronstadt', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=763125'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'gAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '76349', 'text': 'Shock Corridor\\n\\nShock Corridor is a 1963 American drama film directed and written by Samuel Fuller.

In some localities green bins are also used to contain unsorted municipal waste. The bins are designed and manufactured by Norseman Environmental (an ORBIS brand), a manufacturer of recycling and organic waste containers in North America.\\n\\nThe program's purpose is to reduce the amount of waste shipped to landfills by turning organic waste into compost. The programs collect kitchen and related organic waste (typically including soiled paper products, pet waste, sawdust, and similar items) using a waist-high green curbside container, for which the programs are named. The municipality picks up the waste on a regular basis along with other garbage and recycling collecting, and composts it in an industrial composting facility. While it is true that home composting can also serve this purpose, the green bin programs are viewed as being more convenient and more inclusive of source materials.\\n\\nSection::::Green bins by country.\\nSection::::Canada.\\nThe following municipalities have implemented a Green Bin program:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Compliance.\\nGreen bin programs have thus far been optional for residents excluding those in Hamilton, Ontario. Many residents willingly cooperate with the programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn all programs, some residents perceive an increase in workload related to garbage handling, and object to the program on that basis. In Durham Region, some residents object to a requirement to use biodegradable liner bags, which adds a cost to the home-owner that does not exist in Toronto. The York Region and Toronto Green Bin programs allow residents to use regular plastic grocery sacks as liner bags.\\n\\nThe following mechanisms are typically used to encourage compliance:\\n\\nSection::::United Kingdom.\\nGreen Bin programmes are now common in the UK. Green Bins have been rolled out over the past 10 years to reduce the quantities of biodegradable waste contained in the black bag in response to the Landfill Directive. Another common colour in the UK for garden waste collection is a brown bin. Some councils collect food waste in a separate container for example, for anaerobic digestion or mixed with garden waste in the wheelie bin, where they go to an in vessel composter. In both cases a kitchen caddy, a 7-litre tub is provided by the council, with cornstarch liners and when full are emptied into a small curbside box or into the garden waste bin.

He was a passenger in the car carrying Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg when they were assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. In the following World War I, Potiorek commanded the Austro-Hungarian forces in the Serbian Campaign of 1914/15.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn in Bad Bleiberg, Carinthia the son of a mining official, Potiorek attended the Imperial and Royal military institute of technology and the \"Kriegsschule\" academy in Vienna. He joined the Austro-Hungarian general staff in 1879, appointed deputy chief by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1902. However, the emperor ignored his ambitions, when in 1906 he filled the post of Chief-of-Staff with \"Feldmarschall-Leutnant\" Franz Conrad von HÃ¶tzendorf at the behest of heir presumptive and deputy commander-in-chief Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Potiorek became Commanding General at Graz, Styria in the rank of a \"Feldzeugmeister\". Serving as Inspector General in Sarajevo since 1910, he was appointed Bosnian governor (\"Landeschef\") the next year, holding both civil and military offices.\\n\\nIn 1913 Potiorek had invited Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie to watch his troops on maneuvers scheduled for 26 and 27 June 1914. An attack on the life of former governor Marijan VareÅ¡anin in 1910 and several rumours on future assaults (leaked by Serbian Prime Minister Nikola PaÅ¡iÄ) did not keep the archduke from a public appearance in Sarajevo, backed by Potiorek who worried about his own prestige.\\n\\nSection::::Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.\\nOn 28 June the royal couple arrived from IlidÅ¾a by train and went to Philipovic army camp where Franz Ferdinand performed a brief review of the troops. Potiorek was waiting to take the royal party to the city hall (present-day National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina) for the official reception. Franz Ferdinand, his wife and several officials switched into a six-car motorcade driving down Appel Quay along Miljacka River without further security measures. Potiorek was in the second car, a GrÃ¤f & Stift \"Double Phaeton\" , open six-seater driven by Leopold Lojka, together with the owner Count Harrach and the royal couple. At 10:10, when the vehicles passed the central police station, assassin Nedeljko ÄabrinoviÄ hurled a hand grenade at the archduke\\'s car. Lojka accelerated when he saw the object flying towards the car, the grenade bounced off the coachwork and exploded under the wheel of the next car, wounding the passengers and several spectators.\\n\\nA furious Franz Ferdinand, after attending the official reception at the City Hall, asked about visiting the members of his party that had been wounded by the bomb. A member of the archduke\\'s staff, Andreas von Morsey, according to his own accounts suggested this might be dangerous, but Potiorek replied \"Do you think Sarajevo is full of assassins? I will take responsibility\". Nevertheless, the governor decided that the royal car should travel on an alternative route to the Sarajevo hospital. However, he forgot to tell the driver about this decision. On the way to the hospital, he took a right turn on the Latin Bridge, where one of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, was sitting in a corner cafÃ© at the time. The assassin had already abandoned his plans, when he saw the alerted driver began to back up the car right in front of him. He stepped forward, drew his gun, and at a distance of about five feet, fired several times into the car. Franz Ferdinand was hit in the neck and Sophie in the abdomen. Neither Potiorek nor Count Harrach or Lojka were injured. Princip later claimed that the bullet that killed Sophie was meant for the governor.\\n\\nSection::::After Ferdinand\\'s assassination.\\nFollowing the assassination, Potiorek organized and stimulated Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo. Potiorek reestablished an auxiliary militia Schutzkorps to implement the policy of anti-Serb repression. Schutzkorps, predominantly recruited among Bosniak population, were involved in the persecution of people of Serb ethnicity particularly in Serb populated areas of eastern Bosnia. Around 5,500 citizens of Serb ethnicity in Bosnia and Herzegovina were arrested, between 700 and 2,200 died in prison while 460 were executed. Around 5,200 Serb families were forcibly expelled from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\n\\nDespite his responsibility, Potiorek remained in office. When the assassination and the succeeding July Crisis led to the outbreak of World War I, he became the commander of all Austro-Hungarian forces on the Balkans. It is speculated that this \"survivor\\'s guilt\" led Potiorek to take charge of the Austro-Hungarian army and lead the first mission to \"punish\" Serbia. He was reportedly very zealous in his actions (multiple times he claimed \"I was spared at Sarajevo so that I may die avenging it!\"), but was apparently an inept commander. The small Royal Serbian Army remained undefeated in all major battles and after the textbook military disasters at the Battle of Cer and the Battle of Kolubara with huge numbers of casualties, he was removed from command on 22 December 1914 and replaced by Archduke Eugen of Austria, a choice that reportedly made him suicidal.\\n\\nSection::::Death and legacy.\\nPotiorek retired to Carinthian Klagenfurt, where he died in 1933.

He campaigned on a platform of campaign finance reform, calling for a $10,000 spending limit and a full disclosure of sources before an election. Markin indicated that his own expenses would be limited to $5,000. He was twenty-seven years old.\\n\\nMarkin's election to the Board of Control gave him an automatic seat on the Metropolitan Toronto council. He emerged as an opponent of downtown Toronto councillor John Sewell, and in 1975 advocated that Metro Council assume direct control of the city's downtown area. He later brought forward a censure motion against Sewell for having said that Metro Parks Commissioner Tommy Thompson deliberately misled council.\\n\\nMarkin called for a reform of North York's election laws in 1975, to permit the senior controller to take over as mayor if the incumbent leaves office in mid-term. He acknowledged to reporters that he held mayoral ambitions himself, but added that he would not seek the position as long as it was held by Mel Lastman, a personal friend.\\n\\nMarkin obtained some national notoriety in late 1976 for speaking out against the federal government's decision to adopt the metric system.\\n\\nMarkin's promising political career came to an unexpected end in late 1976. He attended only one North York council meeting in the second half of the year, and left the city in November to take rabbinical studies in New York. He did not seek re-election in the 1976 campaign.

The lawyer in question had hired Scott as his representative in a disciplinary case six years earlier, and later accused Scott of negligence when the result led to his disbarment. The suit received extensive media coverage before being dismissed by a jury. In 1995, Markin represented a teacher who claimed he was discriminated against by the Toronto Separate (ie. Roman Catholic) School Board, because he himself was not a Catholic. In 2001, he represented Toronto Transit Commission workers who argued that they were exposed to asbestos dust while rebuilding the Sheppard subway station.\\n\\nHe represented Salim Damji in a major fraud case in 2002, and oversaw Damji's plea of guilty to the charges against him.

Markin appealed for a light sentence, arguing that Damji had been put up to the scheme by figures involved in organized crime.\\n\\nSection::::Other.\\nMarkin opened Le Karem kosher wine store in 1986, selling eight types of wine made in accordance with Talmudic principles.

Despite this advantages, it didn't proved very successful, mainly due to low number of manufactured vehicles, as only about 400\\xa0vehicles were manufactured between 1994 and 2002 (taking in consideration all its versions (220, 230, 260) and derivate vehicles â coach, trolleybus, shorter wheelbase version), and probably by concurrence (mainly second hand vehicles but also some new busses) and high price.

Most of the events took place in the Upper South. While the fighting stretched across the entire period, there were times of little or no action, at times spanning several months.\\n\\nThe Cherokee leader Dragging Canoe, whom some historians call \"the Savage Napoleon\", and his warriors and other Cherokee fought alongside and in conjunction with Indians from a number of other tribes, most often Muscogee in the Old Southwest and the Shawnee in the Old Northwest. During the Revolutionary War, they also fought alongside British troops, Loyalist militia, and the King\\'s Carolina Rangers.\\n\\nOpen warfare broke out in the summer of 1776 along the frontier of the Watauga, Holston, Nolichucky, and Doe rivers in East Tennessee, as well as the colonies (later states) of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. It later spread to those along the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee and in Kentucky.\\n\\nThe wars can be divided into two phases. The first phase one place from 1776 to 1783, in which the Cherokee fought as allies of the Kingdom of Great Britain against the American colonies. The Cherokee War of 1776 encompassed the entirety of the Cherokee nation. At the end of 1776, the only militant Cherokee were those who migrated with Dragging Canoe to the Chickamauga towns and were known as the \"Chickamauga Cherokee\". The second phase lasted from 1783 to 1794, in which the Cherokee served as proxies of the Viceroyalty of New Spain against the recently formed United States of America. Because of their relocation westward to new homes initially known as the \"Five Lower Towns\", they then became known as the Lower Cherokee, a moniker which persisted well into the 19th century. In 1786, the Lower Cherokee became founding members of the Native Americans\\' Western Confederacy, organized by Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, and took an active part in the Northwest Indian War.\\n\\nThe conflict ended in November 1794 with the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. The Northwest Indian War, in which the Cherokee were also involved, ended with the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. \\n\\nSection::::Prelude (1763â75).\\nThe French and Indian War and the related European theater conflict known as the Seven Years\\' War laid many of the foundations for the conflict between the Cherokee and the American settlers on the frontier. These tensions on the frontier broke out into open hostilities with the advent of the American Revolution.\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath of the French and Indian War.\\nThe action of the French and Indian War in North America included the Anglo-Cherokee War, lasting 1758â1761. British forces under general James Grant destroyed a number of major Cherokee towns, which were never reoccupied. Kituwa was abandoned, and its former residents migrated west; they took up residence at \"Mialoquo\", called Great Island Town, on the Little Tennessee River among the Overhill Cherokee.\\n\\nAt the end of this conflict, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston with the Colony of Virginia (1761) and the Treaty of Charlestown with the Province of South Carolina (1762). Conocotocko (Standing Turkey), the First Beloved Man during the conflict, was replaced by Attakullakulla, who was pro-British.\\n\\nValuing the support of Native Americans, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763. This prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, in an effort to preserve territory for the native tribes. Many colonials resented the interference with their drive to the vast western lands. The proclamation was a major irritant to the colonists, contributing to their support for the American Revolution and ending interference by the Crown.\\n\\nSection::::Treaties and land cessation.\\nTo resolve the problem of settlers living beyond the line established in the previous treaty, John Stuart, as Superintendent for Southern Indian Affairs, negotiated a treaty signed on October 17, 1768, with the Cherokee surrendering their claims to the Colony of Virginia to the land between the Allegheny Mountains and the Ohio River. Essentially, it covered what is now West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, with a bit of the southwest corner of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nAfter Pontiac\\'s War (1763â64), the Iroquois Confederacy ceded to the British government its claims to the hunting grounds between the Ohio and Cumberland rivers, known to them and other Indians as Kain-tuck-ee (Kentucky), in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix.\\n\\nIn 1769, developers and land speculators planned to start a new colony called Vandalia in the territory ceded by the Cherokee. Plans for that fell through, however, and Virginia annexed it as the District of West Augusta in 1774. On June 1, 1773, the Cherokee and the Muskogee ceded their claims to 2 million acres in the northern sector of the Georgia colony, in return for the cancellation of their debts. Most of the Muscogee refused to recognize the treaty, and the British government rejected it.\\n\\nSection::::Dunmore\\'s War (1774).\\nThe next year, Daniel Boone led a group to establish a temporary settlement inside the hunting grounds of modern day Kansas. In retaliation the Shawnee, Lenape (Delaware), Mingo, and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party, which included Boone\\'s son James. James Boone and Henry Russell (a member of one of the two parties) were captured by the Native Americans and ritually tortured to death. The colonists responded with the beginning of Dunmore\\'s War (1773â1774).\\n\\nThe Cherokee and the Muscogee were active also, mainly confining themselves to small raids on the backcountry settlements of the Carolinas and Georgia. \\n\\nSection::::Early colonial settlements in Upper East Tennessee (1768â1772).\\nThe earliest colonial settlement in the vicinity of what became Upper East Tennessee was Sapling Grove (Bristol). The first of the North-of-Holston settlements, it was founded by Evan Shelby, who \"purchased\" the land in 1768 from John Buchanan. Jacob Brown began another settlement on the Nolichucky River, and John Carter another in what became known as Carter\\'s Valley (between Clinch River and Beech Creek), both in 1771. Following the Battle of Alamance in 1771, James Robertson led a group of some twelve or thirteen Regulator families from North Carolina to the Watauga River.\\n\\nEach of the groups thought they were within the territorial limits of the colony of Virginia. After a survey proved their mistake, Alexander Cameron, Deputy Superintendent for Indian Affairs, ordered them to leave. Attakullakulla, First Beloved Man (Principal Chief) of the Cherokee, interceded on their behalf. The settlers were allowed to remain, provided no additional people joined them.\\n\\nOn May 8, 1772, the settlers on the Watauga and on the Nolichucky signed the Watauga Compact to form the Watauga Association.\\n\\nSection::::Henderson Purchase (1775).\\nOn March 17, 1775, a group of North Carolina speculators led by Richard Henderson negotiated the Treaty of Watauga at Sycamore Shoals with the older Overhill Cherokee leaders; Oconostota and Attakullakulla, the most prominent, ceded the claim of the Cherokee to the Kain-tuck-ee lands. The Transylvania Land Company believed it was gaining ownership of the land, not realizing that other tribes, such as the Lenape, Shawnee, and Chickasaw, also claimed these lands for hunting. Documented Cherokee towns like Sullen Possum in southeast Kentucky and in other areas of Kentucky did exist with links to what is called the Overhill towns and other Cherokee towns.\\n\\nDragging Canoe, headman of Great Island Town and son of Attakullakulla, refused to go along with the deal. He told the North Carolina men, \"You have bought a fair land, but there is a cloud hanging over it; you will find its settlement dark and bloody\". The governors of Virginia and North Carolina repudiated the Watauga treaty, and Henderson fled to avoid arrest. George Washington also spoke out against it. The Cherokee appealed to John Stuart, the Indian Affairs Superintendent, for help, which he had provided on previous such occasions, but the outbreak of the American Revolution intervened.\\n\\nHenderson and frontiersmen thought the outbreak of the Revolution superseded the judgments of the royal governors. The Transylvania Company began recruiting settlers for the region they had \"purchased\".\\n\\nSection::::Revolutionary War phase: Cherokee War of 1776.\\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee not only fought against the settlements in the Overmountain region, and later in the Cumberland Basin, defending against territorial encroachment, they also fought as allies of Great Britain against its rebellious subjects. British strategy was focused on the North, and not so much on the backwoods settlements, especially those in the west. The Cherokee, therefore, were on their own, except for supplies from British ports on the coast and some joint operations in South Carolina.\\n\\nSection::::Flight of the Loyalists.\\nAs tensions rose, Loyalist John Stuart, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, was besieged by a mob at his house in Charleston and had to flee for his life. His first stop was St. Augustine in East Florida.\\n\\nAnother noted Loyalist later associated with the Cherokee, Thomas Brown, was not nearly so fortunate. In his home of Brownsborough, Georgia, near Augusta, he was assaulted by a crowd of the Sons of Liberty, tied to a tree, roasted with fire, scalped, tarred, and feathered. After his escape, he took up residence among the Seminole commanding his East Florida Rangers, who fought with them and some of the Lower Muskogee.\\n\\nFrom St. Augustine, Stuart sent his deputy, Alexander Cameron, and his brother Henry to Mobile to obtain short-term supplies and arms for the Cherokee. Dragging Canoe took a party of 80 warriors to provide security for the pack train. He met Henry Stuart and Cameron (whom he had adopted as a brother) at Mobile on March 1, 1776. He asked how he could help the British against their rebel subjects, and for help with the illegal settlers. The two men told him to wait for regular troops to arrive before taking any action.\\n\\nWhen the two arrived at Chota, Henry Stuart sent out letters to the frontier settlers. He informed them that they were illegally on Cherokee land and gave them 40 days to leave. In an exercise of propaganda, people sympathetic to the Revolution forged a letter to indicate a large force of regular troops, plus Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscgoee, was on the march from Pensacola and planning to pick up reinforcements from the Cherokee. The forged letters alarmed the settlers, who began gathering together in closer, fortified groups, building stations (small forts), and otherwise preparing for an attack.\\n\\nSection::::Visit from the northern tribes.\\nIn May 1776, partly at the behest of Henry Hamilton, the British governor in Detroit, the Shawnee chief Cornstalk led a delegation from the northern tribes (Shawnee, Lenape, Iroquois, Ottawa, others) to the southern tribes. He traveled to Chota to meet with the southern tribes (Cherokee, Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw) about fighting with the British against their common enemy. Cornstalk called for united action against those they called the \"Long Knives\", the squatters who settled and remained in Kain-tuck-ee, or, as the settlers called it, Transylvania. At the close of his speech, Cornstalk offered his war belt, and Dragging Canoe accepted it. Dragging Canoe also accepted belts from the Ottawa and the Iroquois.\\n\\nTo prepare themselves for the coming campaign, the Overhill Cherokee began raiding into Kentucky, often with the Shawnee. Before the northern delegation had left, Dragging Canoe led a small war party into Kentucky and returned with four scalps to present to Cornstalk before they departed. In another raid, a war party led by Hanging Maw, captured three teenage settler girls, Jemima Boone and Elizabeth and Frances Callaway, on July 14 but lost them three days later to a rescue party led by Daniel Boone, father of Jemima, and Richard Callaway, father of Elizabeth and Frances.\\n\\nSection::::First Cherokee campaigns.\\nIn late June, war parties from the Lower Towns began attacking the frontier of South Carolina. On July 1, the Out, Middle, and Valley Towns sent out war parties raiding the frontiers settlements of North Carolina east of the Blue Ridge coming down the Catawba River. Meanwhile, traders warned the Overmountain settlers of the impending attacks from the Overhill Towns. They had come from Chota bearing word from Nancy Ward, the Beloved Woman (leader or Elder). The Cherokee offensive proved to be disastrous for the attackers.\\n\\nOn July 3, a small war party of Cherokee besieged a small fort on the North Carolina frontier. The garrison managed to keep from being overrun until a large body of militia arrived in the rear of besiegers, who then retreated.\\n\\nA 190-strong war party of Cherokee and Loyalist partisans dressed as Cherokee attacked the large fort on the South Carolina frontier known as Lindley\\'s Station. Its 150-man Patriot garrison had just finished building it the day before. After repulsing the attack, the Patriots gave chase, killing two Loyalists and capturing ten, but inflicting no casualties on the Cherokee.\\n\\nDragging Canoe\\'s forces advanced up the Great Indian Warpath and had a small skirmish with a body of militia numbering twenty who quickly withdrew. Pursuing them and intending to take Fort Lee at Long-Island-on-the-Holston, his force advanced toward the island. However, on July 20, it encountered a larger force of militia six miles from their target, about half the size of his own but desperate, in a stronger position than the small group before. During the \"Battle of Island Flats\" which followed, Dragging Canoe was wounded in his hip by a musket ball, and his brother Little Owl incredibly survived after being hit eleven times. His force then withdrew, raiding isolated cabins on the way and returned to the Overhill area with plunder and scalps, after raiding further north into southwestern Virginia.\\n\\non July 21, Abraham of Chilhowee led his party in attempting to capture Fort Caswell on the Watauga, but his attack was driven off with heavy casualties. Instead of withdrawing, however, he put the garrison under siege, a tactic which had worked well the previous decade with Fort Loudon. After two weeks, though, he and his warriors gave that up. Savanukah\\'s party raided from the outskirts of Carter\\'s Valley far into the Clinch River Valley in Virginia, but those targets contained only small settlements and isolated farmsteads, so he did no real military damage.\\n\\nSection::::Colonial response.\\nThe affected colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia conferred and decided that swift and massive retaliation was the only way to preserve peace on the frontier. The colonials gathered militia who retaliated against the Cherokee. North Carolina sent Griffith Rutherford with 2,400 militia to scour the Oconaluftee and Tuckasegee river valleys, and the headwaters of the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee. South Carolina sent 1,800 men to the Savannah, and Georgia sent 200 to attack Cherokee settlements along the Chattahoochee and Tugaloo rivers.\\n\\nNot long after leaving Fort McGahey on July 23, Rutherford\\'s militia, accompanied by a large contingent of Catawba warriors, encountered an ambush by the Cherokee at the Battle of Cowee Gap in what is now western North Carolina. After defeating the attackers, he proceeded to a designated rendezvous with the South Carolina militia.\\n\\nOn August 1, Cameron and the Cherokee ambushed Andrew Williamson and his South Carolina militia force near the Lower Cherokee town of Isunigu known to whites as Seneca, in the Battle of Twelve Mile Creek. The South Carolina Militia retreated and later joined up with the militia force of Andrew Pickens. The next day, August 2, the joint militia force bivouacked, and Pickens led a party of 25 to forage for food and firewood. In what is known as the Ring Fight, 200 Cherokee surrounded and attacked the party, which withdrew into a ring and were able to hold their attackers at bay until reinforcements arrived. Pickens and his militia defeated the Cherokee on the Tugaloo River in the Battle of Tugaloo, which they then burned on August 10. On August 12, Williamson and Pickens defeated the Cherokee at the Battle of Tamassee. With this, they had completed their destruction of the Lower Towns, Keowee, Estatoe, Seneca, and the rest. Afterwards, they proceeded north to meet up with the North Carolina militia of Griffith Rutherford.\\n\\nRutherford\\'s militia traversed Swannanoa Gap in the Blue Ridge on September 1, and reached the outskirts of the Out, Valley, and Middle Towns on September 14, at which they started burning towns and crops. Williamson\\'s militia were attacked at the Battle of Black Hole near Franklin, North Carolina on September 19 but were able to fend off the Cherokee and meet up with Rutherford. In all, Williamson, Pickens, and Rutherford destroyed more than 50 towns, burned the houses and food stores, destroyed the orchards, slaughtered livestock, and killed hundreds of Cherokee. They sold captives into slavery, and these were often transported to the Caribbean.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Continental Army sent Col. William Christian to the lower Little Tennessee Valley with a battalion of Continentals, 500 Virginia militia, 300 North Carolina militia, and 300 rangers. Upon reaching the Little Tennessee in late October, Christian\\'s Virginia force found those towns from whence the militant attackers had sprungâGreat Island, Citico (\"Sitiku\"), Toqua (\"Dakwayi\"), Tuskegee (\"Taskigi\"), Chilhowee, and Great Tellicoânot only deserted but burned to the ground by their own former inhabitants, along with all the food and stores that could not be carried away.\\n\\nSection::::Migration to Chickamauga.\\nOconostota supported making peace with the colonists. Dragging Canoe called for the women, children, and old to be sent below the Hiwassee and for the warriors to burn the towns, then ambush the Virginians at the French Broad River. Oconostota, Attakullakulla, and the older chiefs decided against that plan. Oconostota sent word to the approaching colonial army, offering to exchange Dragging Canoe and Cameron if the Overhill Towns were spared.\\n\\nDragging Canoe spoke to the council of the Overhill Towns, denouncing the older leaders as rogues and \"Virginians\" for their willingness to cede land for an ephemeral safety. He concluded, \"As for me, I have my young warriors about me. We will have our lands.\" Afterward, he and other militant leaders, including Ostenaco, gathered like-minded Cherokee from the Overhill, Valley, and Hill towns, and migrated to what is now the Chattanooga, Tennessee area,\\nwhere the Great Indian Warpath crossed the Chickamauga River (South Chickamauga Creek). Since Dragging Canoe made that town his seat of operations, frontier Americans called his faction the \"Chickamaugas\". Other Cherokee refugees turned up in Pensacola and wintered there.\\n\\nJohn McDonald already had a trading post across the Chickamauga River. This provided a link to Henry Stuart, brother of John, in the West Florida capital of Pensacola. Cameron, the British deputy Indian superintendent, accompanied Dragging Canoe to Chickamauga. Nearly all the whites legally resident among the Cherokee were part of the related exodus.\\nIn March 1777, Cameron sent the refugees to Chickamauga along with a sizable amount of goods. The colonials learned of the materiel and planned to intercept it. When Cameron informed him of the danger, Emistisigua, Paramount Chief of the Upper Muscogee, sent a force of 350 warriors to guard them as well as to assist in rebuilding and waging war.\\n\\nSection::::Treaties of 1777.\\nPreliminary negotiations between the Overhill Towns and Virginia were held at Fort Patrick Henry in April 1777. Nathaniel Gist, later father of Sequoyah, led the talks for Virginia, while Attakullakulla, Oconostota, and Savanukah headed the delegation of Cherokee.\\n\\nThe Cherokee signed the \"Treaty of Dewitt\\'s Corner\" with Georgia and South Carolina on May 20 and the \"Treaty of Fort Henry\" with Virginia and North Carolina on July 20. They promised to stop warring, with those colonies promising in return to protect them from attack. In the Treaty of Dewitt\\'s Corner, the Lower Towns ceded all their land in modern South Carolina except for a small strip in what is now Oconee County. One provision of the Treaty of Fort Henry required that James Robertson and a small garrison be quartered at Chota on the Little Tennessee. He had been appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for North Carolina, while Joseph Martin had been appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Virginia.\\n\\nSection::::Targets of the Cherokee.\\nFrom their new bases, the Cherokee conducted raids against settlers on the Holston, Doe, Watauga, and Nolichucky rivers, on the Cumberland and Red rivers, and those in the isolated frontier stations in between. The Cherokee ambushed parties traveling on the Tennessee River, and on local sections of the many ancient trails that served as \"highways\", such as the Great Indian Warpath (Mobile to northeast Canada), the Cisca and St. Augustine Trail (St. Augustine to the French Salt Lick at Nashville), the Cumberland Trail (from the Upper Creek Path to the Great Lakes), and the Nickajack Trail (Nickajack to Augusta). Later, the Cherokee stalked the Natchez Trace and roads improved by the uninvited settlers, such as the Kentucky, Cumberland, and Walton roads. Occasionally, the Cherokee attacked targets in Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, and the Ohio country.\\n\\nIn contempt of the peace proceedings at Fort Henry in April 1777, Dragging Canoe led a war party that killed a settler named Frederick Calvitt and stole 15 horses from James Robertson, then moved to Carter\\'s Valley, killing the grandparents of David Crockett along with several children near the modern Rogersville, and marauding across the valley. In all the raiders took twelve scalps.\\n\\nIn summer 1777, Deputy Superintendents Cameron and Taitt led a large contingent of Cherokee and Muscogee warriors against the back country settlements of the Carolinas and Georgia. The Cherokee established a camp at the confluence of the Tennessee and Ohio Rivers (near present-day Paducah, Kentucky) to prevent infiltration into the Mississippi in the spring of 1778.\\n\\nSection::::Revolutionary War phase: Southern strategy (1778â1783).\\nIn late 1778, British strategy shifted south. As their attention went, so too did their efforts, their armies, and their supplies, including those slated for the Southern Indians. The Southern theater had the added advantage of being home to more Loyalists than the North. With all these new advantages, the Cherokee were able to greatly renew their territorial defense. Both the Cherokee and the Upper Creek signed on for active participation.\\n\\nSection::::British victory in the North.\\nOn December 17, 1778, Henry Hamilton captured Fort Vincennes and used it as a base to plan a spring offensive against George Rogers Clark, whose forces had recently seized control of much of the Illinois Country. His plans were to assemble 500 warriors from various Indian nations, including the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the Shawnee, and others, for a campaign to expel Clark\\'s forces back east, then drive through Kentucky clearing American settlements. McDonald\\'s headquarters at Chickamauga was to be the staging ground and commissary for the Cherokee and the Muscogee. Clark recaptured Fort Vincennes, and Hamilton along with it, on February 25, 1779, after the Siege of Fort Vincennes. The Chickamauga Cherokee turned their sights to the northeast.\\n\\nSection::::Battles in the Deep South.\\nThe British captured Savannah on December 29, 1778, with help from Dragging Canoe, John McDonald, and the Cherokee, along with McGillivray\\'s Upper Muscogee force and McIntosh\\'s band of Hitichiti warriors. Just over a month later, January 31, 1779, they captured Augusta, Georgia, as well, though they quickly had to retreat. With these victories, the remaining neutral towns of the Lower Muscogee Threw in their lot with the British side. Thomas Brown of the King\\'s Carolina Rangers was assigned to the Atlantic District to work with the Cherokee, Muscogee, and Seminole.\\n\\nCharlestown was captured on May 12, 1780, after a siege that began March 29. Along with it, the British took prisoner some 3,000 Patriots, including South Carolina militia leader Andrew Williamson. Upon giving his parole that he would not again take up arms, Williamson became a double agent for the Patriots, according to testimony after the war by Patriot General Nathanael Greene.\\n\\nSection::::Fort Nashborough.\\nIn early 1779, Robertson and John Donelson traveled overland along the Kentucky Road and founded Fort Nashborough on the Cumberland River. It was the first of many such settlements in the Cumberland area, which subsequently became the focus of attacks by all the tribes in the surrounding region. Leaving a small group there, both returned east. In autumn 1779, Robertson and a group of fellow Wataugans left the east down the Kentucky Road headed for Fort Nashborough. They arrived on Christmas Day 1779 without incident.\\n\\nDonelson journeyed down the Tennessee River with a party that included his family, intending to go across to the mouth of the Cumberland, then upriver to Fort Nashborough. They departed the East Tennessee settlements on February 27, 1780. Eventually, the group did reach its destination, but only after being ambushed several times. In the first encounter near Tuskegee Island on March 7, the Cherokee warriors under Bloody Fellow attacked the boat in the rear. Its passengers had come down with smallpox. They took as captive the one survivor, who was later ransomed by American colonists. The victory proved to be a pyrrhic one for the Cherokee, a smallpox epidemic spread among its people, killing several hundred in the vicinity. Several miles downriver, beginning with the obstruction known as the Suck or the Kettle, the party was fired upon throughout their passage through the Tennessee River Gorge (Cash Canyon); one person died and several were wounded. At Muscle Shoals, the Donelson party was attacked by Muscogee and Chickasaw, up into Hardin County, Tennessee. The Donelson party reached its destination on April 24, 1780. The group included John\\'s daughter Rachel, the future wife of future U.S. Representative, Senator, and President Andrew Jackson, who fought a duel in her honor in 1806. Shortly after his party\\'s arrival at Fort Nashborough, Donelson along with Robertson and others formed the Cumberland Compact.\\n\\nSection::::Overmountain theatre.\\nRobertson heard warning from Chota that Dragging Canoe\\'s warriors were going to attack the Holston area. In addition, he had received intelligence that McDonald\\'s place was the staging area for the northern campaign that Hamilton had been planning to conduct, and that a stockpile of supplies equivalent to that of 100 packhorses was stored there. Small parties of Cherokee began repeated small raids on the Holston frontier shortly thereafter.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1780, Thomas Brown planned to have a joint conference between the Cherokee and Muscogee to plan ways to coordinate their attacks, but those plans were forestalled when Georgians under Elijah Clarke made a concerted effort to retake Augusta in September, where he had his headquarters. His King\\'s Carolina Rangers and 50 Muscogee warriors formed the entire garrison against Clarke\\'s 700 fighters.\\n\\nThe arrival of a sizable war party from the Chickamauga and Overhill Towns and a force from Fort Ninety-Six in South Carolina prevented the capture of both, and the Cherokee and Brown\\'s rangers chased Elijah Clarke\\'s army into the arms of John Sevier, wreaking havoc on rebellious settlements along the way. This set the stage for the Battle of Kings Mountain October 7, 1780, in which Loyalist militia American Volunteers under Patrick Ferguson moved south trying to encircle Clarke; they were defeated by a force of 900 frontiersmen under Sevier and William Campbell, who were referred to as the Overmountain Men.\\n\\nBrown, aware that nearly 1,000 men were away from the American settlements with the militias, urged Dragging Canoe and other Cherokee leaders to strike while they had the opportunity. Under the influence of Savanukah, the Overhill Towns gave their full support to the new offensive. Both Brown and the Cherokee had been expecting a quick victory by Patrick Ferguson and were stunned that he suffered such a resounding defeat so soon. But their planned assault on the settlements was in motion.\\nLearning of the new invasion from Nancy Ward (her second documented betrayal of Dragging Canoe), Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson sent an expedition of 700 Virginians and North Carolinians against the Cherokee in December 1780, under the command of Sevier. The expedition routed a Cherokee war party at the Battle of Boyd\\'s Creek on December 16.\\n\\nAfter that battle, Sevier\\'s army was joined by forces under Arthur Campbell and Joseph Martin. The combined force marched against the Overhill towns on the Little Tennessee and the Hiwassee, burning seventeen of them, including Chota, Chilhowee, the original Citico, Tellico, Great Hiwassee, and Chestowee, finishing up on January 1, 1781. Afterwards, the Overhill leaders withdrew from further active conflict for a time, though warriors from the Middle and Valley Towns continued to harass colonists on the frontier. \\n\\nNot long after returning home from his destruction of the Overhill towns, Sevier had received word that the warriors from the Middle Towns were bent on revenge. At the beginning of March, Sevier raised a force for a campaign against the Middle and Out Towns east of the mountains. Beginning at Tuckasegee and ending at Cowee, they burned 15 towns, killed 29 Cherokee, and took 9 prisoners.\\n\\nWhile Dragging Canoe and his warriors turned their attentions to the Cumberland, the Shawnee began raiding settlements in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, the latter by now having become Washington County. In particular they targeted those along the Clinch and Holston Rivers and in Powell\\'s Valley. These Shawnee came down from their homes on the Ohio River by way of the Warriors\\' Path through the Cumberland Gap. Their attacks continued, along with occasional forays by McGillivray\\'s Upper Muscogee, even after sporadic raids by the Cherokee renewed, until they began to focus all their attention on the Northwest Indian War.\\n\\nIn midsummer 1781, a party of Cherokee came west over the mountains and began raiding the new settlements on the French Broad River. Sevier raised a force of 150 and attacked their camp on Indian Creek.\\n\\nOn July 26, 1781, the Overhill Towns signed the second Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston, this time directly with the Overmountain settlements. In response to incursions by new settlers beyond the limits of the treaties, warriors from the Chickamauga Towns began harassing the Holston frontier in the spring and summer of 1782. In September, an expedition under Sevier once again destroyed many of the towns in the Chickamauga vicinity, and those Cherokee of the former Lower Towns now in North Georgia, from Buffalo Town at the modern Ringgold, Georgia south to Ustanali (\"Ustanalahi\") near modern Calhoun, Georgia, including what he called Vann\\'s Town, as well as Ellijay and Coosawattee. Most of the towns were deserted because having advance warning of the impending attack, Dragging Canoe and his fellow leaders chose relocation westward. Meanwhile, Sevier\\'s army, guided by John Watts, somehow never managed to cross paths with any parties of Cherokee.\\n\\nSection::::Attacks at Chickamauga.\\nAt the beginning of April 1779, a group of 300 Cherokee and 50 Loyalist Rangers under Walter Scott, left the Chickamauga Towns headed for a marauding campaign against the frontier settlements in Georgia and South Carolina. Hearing of their departure, Joseph Martin, Indian agent for the Americans at Chota, sent word to Governor Patrick Henry of their absence.\\n\\nThe state governments of Virginia and North Carolina made a joint decision to send an expedition against the Chickamauga Towns, who were thought to be responsible for the raids. Most of those warriors, however, were in South Carolina with Cameron and Dragging Canoe. A thousand Overmountain men under Evan Shelby (father of Isaac Shelby, first governor of the State of Kentucky) and a regiment of Continentals under John Montgomery disembarked on April 10, boating down the Tennessee in a fleet of dugout canoes. They arrived in the Chickamauga towns ten days later. For the next two weeks, they destroyed the eleven towns in the immediate area, and most of the food supply, along with McDonald\\'s home, store, and commissary. Because the warriors were on a campaign in Georgia and South Carolina, there was no resistance and only four deaths among the inhabitants. Whatever was not destroyed was confiscated and sold at what became known as Sale Creek.\\nUpon hearing of the devastation of the towns and loss of all their stores, Dragging Canoe, McDonald, and their men, including the Rangers, returned to Chickamauga and its vicinity. The Shawnee sent envoys to Chickamauga to find out if the destruction had caused Dragging Canoe\\'s people to lose the will to fight, along with a sizable detachment of warriors to assist them. In response to their inquiries, Dragging Canoe held up the war belts he had accepted when the delegation visited Chota in 1776, and said, \"We are not yet conquered\". To cement the alliance, the Cherokee responded to the Shawnee gesture by sending nearly 100 warriors north. The towns in the Chickamauga area were rebuilt. Dragging Canoe responded to the Shelby expedition with punitive raids on the frontiers of both North Carolina and Virginia.\\n\\nIn midsummer 1779, Cameron arrived at Chickamauga with a company of Loyalist Refugees and convinced the Cherokee to join them on their march to South Carolina. Three hundred took up arms and headed out to maraud the backcountry of Georgia and South Carolina. Later in October, Andrew Williamson\\'s South Carolina militia responded by attacking several towns on the eastern frontier of Cherokee territory and burning their foodstores.\\n\\nSection::::Chickasaw-American war.\\nThe Chickasaw transformed from river sentries into attacking warriors in June 1780 when George Rogers Clark and a party of over 500, including some Kaskaskia of the Illinois Confederation, built Fort Jefferson and the surrounding settlement of Clarksville near the mouth of the Ohio, inside their hunting grounds. The building had begun in April and finished before the first attack on June 7.\\n\\nAfter learning of the trespass, the Chickasaw destroyed the settlement, laid siege to the fort, and began attacking settlers on the Kentucky frontier. They continued attacking the Cumberland and into Kentucky through early the following year. Their last raid was in conjunction with Dragging Canoe\\'s Cherokee, upon Freeland\\'s Station on the Cumberland on January 11, 1781.\\n\\nThree months after the first Chickasaw attack on the Cumberland, on April 2, 1781, the Cherokee launched their largest campaign of the wars against those settlements. This culminated in what became known as the Battle of the Bluff, led by Dragging Canoe. It lasted through to the next day and was the last attack of this war. Afterward, settlers began to abandon these frontier settlements until only three stations were left, a condition which lasted until 1785.\\n\\nSection::::Lenape refugees.\\nWhile the Middle Towns warriors kept the Overmountain Men busy, the Chickamauga Towns welcome a sizable party of Lenape warriors seeking refuge from the fighting in the Illinois and Ohio Countries. These were not just warriors down south temporarily but permanent settlers who brought their families.\\n\\nSection::::Politics in the Overhill Towns.\\nIn the fall of 1781, the British engineered a coup d\\'Ã©tat of sorts that put Savanukah as First Beloved Man in place of the more pacifist Oconostota, who succeeded Attakullakulla. For the next two years, the Overhill Cherokee openly, as they had been doing covertly, supported the efforts of Dragging Canoe and his militant Cherokee.\\n\\nSection::::Death of Alexander Cameron.\\nOn December 27, 1781, Alexander Cameron, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Mississippi District, blood brother to Dragging Canoe, and friend to all Cherokee, died in Savannah. He was replaced by John Graham.\\n\\nSection::::Diplomatic mission to Fort St. Louis.\\nA party of Cherokee joined the Lenape, Shawnee, and Chickasaw in a diplomatic visit to the Spanish at Fort St. Louis in the Missouri country in March 1782 seeking a new avenue of obtaining arms and other assistance in the prosecution of their ongoing conflict with the Americans in the Ohio Valley. One group of Cherokee at this meeting led by Standing Turkey (Conocotocko) sought and received permission to settle in Spanish Louisiana, in the region of the White River.\\n\\nSection::::Migration to the Lower Towns.\\nUpon finishing their move, Dragging Canoe and his people established what whites called the Five Lower Towns downriver from the various natural obstructions in the 26-mile Tennessee River Gorge, known locally as Cash Canyon. Starting with Tuskegee (aka Brown\\'s or Williams\\') Island and the sandbars on either side of it, these obstructions included the Tumbling Shoals, the Holston Rock, the Kettle (or Suck), the Suck Shoals, the Deadman\\'s Eddy, the Pot, the Skillet, the Pan, and, finally, the Narrows, ending with Hale\\'s Bar. The whole 26 miles was sometimes called The Suck, and the stretch of river was notorious enough to merit mention even by Thomas Jefferson. These navigational hazards were so formidable, in fact, that the French agents attempting to travel upriver to reach Cherokee country during the French and Indian War, intending to establish an outpost at the spot later occupied by British agent McDonald, gave up after several attempts.\\n\\nThe Five Lower Towns included Running Water (\"Amogayunyi\"), at the current Whiteside in Marion County, Tennessee, where Dragging Canoe made his headquarters; Nickajack (\"Ani-Kusati-yi\", or Koasati place), eight kilometers down the Tennessee River; Long Island (\"Amoyeligunahita\"), on the Tennessee just above the Great Creek Crossing; Crow Town (\"Kagunyi\") on the Tennessee, at the mouth of Crow Creek; and Stecoyee (\"Utsutigwayi\", Lookout Mountain Town), at the current site of Trenton, Georgia. Tuskegee Island Town was reoccupied as a lookout post by a small band of warriors to provide advance warning of invasions, and eventually many other settlements in the area were resettled as well.\\n\\nBecause this was a move into the outskirts of Muscogee territory, Dragging Canoe, knowing such a move might be necessary, had previously sent a delegation under Little Owl to meet with Alex McGillivray, the major Muscogee leader in the area, to gain their permission. When the Cherokee moved their base, so too did John McDonald, now deputy to Thomas Brown, along with his own assistant Daniel Ross, making Running Water the base of operations. Graham\\'s deputy, Alexander Campbell, set up his own base at what became Turkeytown.\\n\\nCherokee continued to migrate westward to join Dragging Canoe\\'s militant band. Many in this influx were Cherokee from North Georgia, who fled the depredations of expeditions such as those of Sevier; a large majority of these were former inhabitants of the original Lower Towns. Cherokee from the Middle, or Hill, Towns also came, a group of whom established a town named Sawtee (\"Itsati\") at the mouth of South Sauta Creek on the Tennessee.\\n\\nLater major settlements included Willstown (\"Titsohiliyi\") near the later Fort Payne; Turkeytown (\"Gundigaduhunyi\"), at the head of the Cumberland Trail where the Upper Creek Path crossed the Coosa River near Centre, Alabama; Creek Path (\"Kusanunnahiyi\"), near at the intersection of the Great Indian Warpath with the Upper Creek Path at the modern Guntersville, Alabama; Turnip Town (\"Ulunyi\"), 7 miles from the present-day Rome, Georgia; and Chatuga (\"Tsatugi\"), nearer the site of Rome.\\n\\nPartly because of the large influx from North Georgia added to the fact that they were no longer occupying the Chickamauga area as their main center, Dragging Canoe\\'s followers and others in the area began to be referred to as the Lower Cherokee. The ranks of these new Lower Cherokee were further swelled by runaway slaves, white Tories, Muscogee, Yuchi, Natchez, and Shawnee, plus a few Spanish, French, Irish, and Germans. The town Coosada came into the coalition when its Koasati and Kaskinampo inhabitants joined Dragging Canoe\\'s coalition. The band of Chickasaw living at Ditto\\'s Landing south of Huntsville, Alabama, also joined the coalition. The rest of the Chickasaw, however, were trying to play the Americans and the Spanish against each other with no interest in the British.\\n\\nSection::::Cherokees to the North.\\nIn November 1782, twenty representatives from four northern tribesâWyandot, Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potowatamiâtraveled south to consult with Dragging Canoe and his lieutenants at his new headquarters in Running Water Town, which was nestled far back up the hollow from the Tennessee River onto which it opened. Their mission was to gain the help of Dragging Canoe\\'s Cherokee in attacking Pittsburgh and the American settlements in Kentucky and the Illinois country. When the party returned north, Turtle-at-Home, brother of Dragging Canoe, took 70 warriors north to fight alongside the Shawnee. \\n\\nAt the beginning of 1783, there were at least three major communities of Cherokee in the region. One lived among the Chalahgawtha (Chillicothe) Shawnee. The second Cherokee community lived among the mixed Wyandot-Mingo towns on the upper Mad River near the later Zanesfield, Ohio. A third group of Cherokee is known to have lived among and fought with the Munsee-Lenape, the only portion of the Lenape nation at war with the Americans. Though filled by different warriors shifted back and forth, these three bands remained in the northwest until after the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.\\n\\nSection::::Georgia Indian war of 1782.\\nAt the end of 1781, the Cherokee invaded Georgia once again with a group of Muscogee, this time being met by South Carolina and Georgia troops under Andrew Pickens and Elijah Clarke at the Oconee River after much back country raiding. Evading the American force, the Cherokee withdrew, adopting a scorched earth strategy to deny their foes supplies. The force eventually retreated, opening the back country to further raids.\\n\\nBy the fall of 1782, Lt. Col. Thomas Waters of the Loyalist Rangers, formerly stationed at Fort Ninety-Six in South Carolina, had retreated to the frontier of Cherokee-Muscogee territory just outside Georgia. From his base at the mouth of Long Swamp Creek on Etowah River, he and his remaining rangers, in conjunction with Cherokee and Muscogee warriors, ravaged backwoods homesteads and settlements.\\n\\nThe states of South Carolina and Georgia sent out a joint expedition led by Andrew Pickens and Elijah Clarke to put an end to his insurgency. Leaving September 16, they invaded that section of the country, ranging at least as far as Ustanali, where they took prisoners. In all they destroyed thirteen towns and villages. By October 22, Waters and his men had escaped and the Cherokee sued for peace.\\n\\nSection::::St. Augustine conference.\\nIn January 1783, Dragging Canoe and 1,200 Cherokee traveled to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, for a summit meeting with a delegation of western tribes (Shawnee, Muscogee, Mohawk, Seneca, Lenape, Mingo, Tuscarora, and Choctaw) called for a federation of Indians to oppose the Americans and their frontier colonists. Brown, the British Indian Superintendent, approved the concept.\\n\\nAt Tuckabatchee a few months later, a general council of the major southern tribes (Cherokee, Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole) plus representatives of smaller groups (Mobile, Catawba, Biloxi, Huoma, etc.) took place to follow up, but plans for the federation were cut short by the signing of the Treaty of Paris. Signed May 30, 1783, the treaty confirmed the northern boundary between the State of Georgia and the Cherokee, with the Cherokee ceding large amounts of land between the Savannah and Chattachoochee Rivers.\\n\\nSection::::Overhill politics.\\nIn the fall of 1783, the older pacifist leaders replaced Savanukah with another of their number, Corntassel (\"Kaiyatsatahi\", known to history as \"Old Tassel\"), and sent messages of peace along with complaints of settler encroachment to Virginia and North Carolina. Opposition from pacifist leaders, however, never stopped war parties from traversing the territories of any of the town groups, largely because the average Cherokee supported their cause, nor did it stop small war parties of the Overhill Towns from raiding settlements in East Tennessee, mostly those on the Holston.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty of Paris (1783).\\nSigned between Great Britain and the United States on September 3, 1783, the Treaty of Paris treaty formally ended the American Revolution. The U.S. had already unilaterally declared hostilities over the previous April. Brown had already received orders from London in June to cease and desist.\\n\\nFollowing that treaty, Dragging Canoe turned to the Spanish (who still claimed all the territory south of the Cumberland and were now working \"against\" the Americans) for support, trading primarily through Pensacola and Mobile. Dragging Canoe also maintained relations with the British governor at Detroit, Alexander McKee, through regular diplomatic missions there under his brothers Little Owl and The Badger (\"Ukuna\").\\n\\nWith the end of the Revolutionary War, new settlers began flooding into the Overmountain settlements. The reaction from the Cherokee was predictable, only it did not come from the towns on the lower Little Tennessee. Instead, warriors from the Middle Towns east of the mountains on the upper Little Tennessee began retaliation against the settlements on the west side, targeting the newer ones on the Pigeon and French Broad rivers. In late 1783, Major Peter Fine raised a small militia and crossed the mountains to the east side and burned down the town of Cowee.\\n\\nSection::::Treaties with the Chickasaw and Muscogee.\\nThe Chickasaw signed the Treaty of French Lick with the new United States of America on November 6, 1783, and never again took up arms against it. The Lower Cherokee were also present at the conference and apparently made some sort of agreement to cease their attacks on the Cumberland, for after this Americans settlements in the area began to grow again.\\n\\nAlso in November 1783, the pro-American camp of the Lower Muscogee nation signed the Treaty of Augusta with Georgia, ceding their claims to territory in northern Georgia known as the Oconee Country, after the tribe who lived there. This enraged McGillivray, who wanted to keep fighting; he burned the houses of the leaders responsible and sent warriors to raid Georgia settlements.\\n\\nSection::::Post-Revolution: New directions (1783â1788).\\nSection::::Spanish alliance.\\nThe Spanish now held East Florida and West Florida in addition to Louisiana, Tejas, Nuevo Mexico, and Nueva California. Partly to hold the Americans at bay and partly to regain lost parts of La Florida, they armed and supplied the Southern Indians both to curry favor and to encourage them to turn their weapons on the frontier settlements. Largely through the efforts of Alex McGillivray, the Spanish signed the Treaty of Pensacola for alliance and commerce with the Upper Muscogee and the Lower Cherokee on May 30, 1784. On June 22, 1784, the Treaty of Mobile was signed with the Choctaw and the Alabama. The Chickasaw, also at this conference, refused to sign because of their treaty with the Americans. With the signing of these two treaties, McDonald and Ross relocated to Turkeytown to consolidate their efforts and business with those of Campbell closer to their Spanish suppliers and to the British trading house of Panton, Leslie & Company in Pensacola.\\n\\nSponsored by the Spanish, Running Water Town hosted a grand council of western nations and tribes in the summer of 1785 to formulate a strategy for resisting encroachment by settlers from the new United States. Besides the Chickamauga Cherokee, the Upper Muscogee and the Choctaw attended from the South, while representatives from the Shawnee, Lenape, Mingo, Miami, Illinois, Wyandot, Ottawa, Mohawk, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia, Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, Wabash Confederacy, and the Iroquois League, came from the North. The same parties met again under sponsorship of the British at Detroit in the fall of 1785. The parties at these two councils agreed among themselves and with their sponsors to deal with the Americans as a unit. This laid the groundwork for the confederacy formally established the next year.\\n\\nSection::::Overmountain region.\\nWith these assurances of support, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns renewed raiding the Overmountain settlements that summer. These remained only sporadic until the fall, when an incident between one of the settlers, James Hubbard, and a noted Cherokee leader in the Overhill Towns, Noonday, brought the younger Overhill warriors into the fight and incited them all to more violence. This could be considered the start of a Southwest Indian War, fought by the Cherokee and later the Muscogee too.\\nIn May 1785, the settlements of Upper East Tennessee, then comprising four counties of western North Carolina, petitioned the Congress of the Confederation to be recognized as the \"State of Franklin\". Even though their petition failed to receive the two-thirds votes necessary to qualify, they proceeded to organize what amounted to a secessionist government, holding their first \"state\" assembly in December 1785. One of their chief motives was to retain the foothold they had recently gained in the Cumberland Basin. The Cumberland settlements were included in the government, but being separated by a wide stretch of hostile Cherokee territory, they were essentially autonomous.\\n\\nOne of the first acts of the new State of Franklin was to negotiate with the Overhill Towns the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, signed on June 10, 1785, which ceded the \"territory south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers and west of the Big Pigeon River and east of the ridge dividing Little River from the Tennessee River\" to the State of Franklin.\\n\\nThe Cherokee in the Overhill, Hill, and Valley Towns signed the Treaty of Hopewell with the United States government on November 28, 1785, under duress, the frontier colonials by this time having spread further along the Holston and onto the French Broad. Several leaders from the Lower Cherokee signed, including two from Chickamauga Town (which had been rebuilt) and one from Stecoyee.\\n\\nSection::::Oconee War.\\nIn spring 1785, McGillivray had convened a council of war at the dominant Upper Muscogee town of Tuckabatchee about recent incursions of Georgian settlers into the Oconee territory. The council, attended by most of the nations and tribes of the soon-to-be Western Confederacy, decided to go on the warpath against the trespassers, starting with the recent settlements along the Oconee River. McGillivray had already secured support from the Spanish in New Orleans. This began the Oconee War, which lasted from May 1785 until September 1794.\\n\\nGeorgia officials signed a new treaty with a few compliant Lower Muscogee micos (headmen) in which the latter ceded the land between the Altamaha and St. Mary\\'s Rivers, and from the head of the latter to the Oconee River. They called this wide stretch of land the Tallassee Country, after the tribe which lived there.\\n\\nSection::::Houston County, Georgia.\\nAfter the Hopewell Treaty, the legislature of the State of Georgia, which claimed all of what became Mississippi Territory created Houston County, to take in the Great Bend of the Tennessee River. The project was a joint venture between Georgia and the State of Franklin. To stake their claim, Valentine Sevier and 90 men went south to what is now South Pittsburg, Tennessee, and built a stockaded settlement and blockhouse in early December 1785.\\n\\nThe chosen location lay midway between Nickajack and Long Island towns of the Chickamauga-Lower Cherokee. By mid-January 1786, the pioneers tired of the constant life-or-death fighting and ended the project. The Houston County project collapsed, leaving the name open for the current Houston County, Georgia, established in 1821.\\n\\nIn order to prevent a re-occurrence, the Cherokee established the town of Crowmocker on Battle Creek near the site of the Civil War-era Fort McCook.\\n\\nSection::::Spanish conspiracy.\\nStarting in 1786, the leaders of the State of Franklin and the Cumberland District began secret negotiations with Esteban RodrÃ­guez MirÃ³, governor of Spanish Louisiana, to deliver their regions to the jurisdiction of the Spanish Empire. Those involved included James Robertson, Daniel Smith, and Anthony Bledsoe of the Cumberland District; John Sevier and Joseph Martin of the State of Franklin; James White, recently appointed American Superintendent for Southern Indian Affairs; and James Wilkinson, governor of Kentucky.\\n\\nThe irony lay in the fact that the Spanish backed the Cherokee and Muscogee harassing their territories. MirÃ³\\'s negotiations with Wilkinson, initiated by the latter, to bring Kentucky into Spanish control also were separate but simultaneous. The conspiracy went as far as the Franklin and Cumberland officials promising to take the oath of loyalty to Spain and renounce allegiance to any other nation. Robertson even successfully petitioned the North Carolina assembly create the \"Mero Judicial District\" for the three Cumberland counties (Davidson, Sumner, Tennessee). There was a convention held in the failing State of Franklin on the question, and those present voted in its favor.\\n\\nA large part of their motivation, besides the desire to secede from North Carolina, was the hope that this course of action would bring relief from Indian attacks. The series of negotiations involved Alex McGillivray, with Robertson and Bledsoe writing him of the Miro District\\'s peaceful intentions toward the Muscogee and simultaneously sending White as emissary to Gardoqui to convey news of their overture.\\n\\nSection::::Cherokee war of 1786.\\nConflict erupted largely because of dissatisfaction over the Treaty of Hopewell, the flames of which were fanned by Dragging Canoe. In the east, it primarily involved warriors from the Overhill and Valley Towns against Franklin, while the Lower Towns to the west primarily raided the Cumberland. In large part elated by their crushing defeat of the attempted Houston County, Cherokee warriors from the Lower Towns raided the Franklin settlements in small parties throughout the spring of 1786. First attacking a homestead on Beaver Creek near the newly established White\\'s Fort (at the modern Knoxville, Tennessee) on July 20, they dispersed into small parties raiding the upper Holston and other parts of Franklin. Throughout the summer of 1786, Dragging Canoe and his warriors along with a large contingent of Muscogee raided the Cumberland region, with several parties raiding well into Kentucky.\\n\\nAfter the rise of the \"local\" Cherokee, Sevier responded with a force under joint command of Alexander Outlaw and William Cocke, which drove off the raiders from the Holston before marching for Coyatee near the mouth of the Little Tennessee. Once there, they burned the crops and the town\\'s council house. Meanwhile, Sevier led another expedition across the mountains to attack the Valley Towns on the headwaters of the Hiwassee. The end result was the Treaty of Coyatee on August 3, 1786, in which the State of Franklin forced Corntassel, Hanging Maw, Watts, and the other Overhill leaders to cede the remaining land between the boundary set by the Dumplin Treaty and the Little Tennessee River to the State of Franklin.\\n\\nSection::::Formation of the Western Confederacy.\\nIn addition to the small bands still operating with the Shawnee, Wyandot-Mingo, and Lenape in the Northwest, a large contingent of Cherokee led by The Glass (Tagwadihi) attended and took an active role in a grand council of western tribes (Six Nations Iroquois, Wyandot, Lenape, Shawnee, Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawotami, Twigtis, Wabash Confedracy, and, of course, the Cherokee themselves) lasting November 28 â December 18, 1786, in the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky just south of the British capital of Detroit. British agents attended, and zealous warriors brought recently acquired scalps.\\n\\nThis meeting, initiated by Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who was head chief of the Iroquois Six Nations and like Dragging Canoe fought on the side of the British during the American Revolution, led to the formation of the Western Confederacy to resist American incursions into the Old Northwest. Dragging Canoe and his Cherokee were full members of the Confederacy. The purpose of the Confederacy was to coordinate attacks and defense in the Northwest Indian War of 1785â1795. According to John Norton, Brant\\'s adopted son, it was here in the north that The Glass formed a friendship with his adopted father that lasted well into the 19th century. The passage of the Northwest Ordinance by the Congress of the Confederation in 1787, establishing the Northwest Territory and essentially giving away the land upon which they lived, only exacerbated the resentment of the tribes in the region.\\n\\nSection::::Trouble with Franklin and Kentucky.\\nIn early 1787, encroachments by American settlers became so great that the Overhill Towns held a council on whether to completely abandon their homes on the Little Tennessee for more removed locations to the west. They elected to stay, but the crisis provoked another rise in the small-scale raiding which never really ceased completely. The situation of the Overhill Cherokee was so bad that refugees appeared in Muscogee towns, and the Chickasaw threatened to break the treaty of 1783 and go on the warpath if something were not done to alleviate the situation.\\n\\nThough they provided auxiliary support against Franklin, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns, playing their role as members of the confederacy, had made Kentucky the target of most of their efforts. A sally from the Kentucky militia led by John Logan mistakenly attacked a hunting party from the Overhill Towns and killed several of its members. In their non-apology to Chota, the Kentuckians warned the Overhill Towns to control Dragging Canoe\\'s warriors or there would be widespread indiscriminate revenge.\\n\\nSection::::Coldwater Indian war (1785â1787).\\nAround 1785, Cherokee and Muscogee warriors bgan to gather in Coldwater town, who then attacked the American settlements along the Cumberland and its environs. The fighting contingent eventually numbered approximately 9 Frenchmen, 35 Cherokee, and 10 Muscogee. Because the townsite was well-hidden and its presence unannounced, James Robertson, commander of the militia in the Cumberland\\'s Davidson and Sumner Counties, at first accused the Lower Cherokee of the new offensives. In 1787, he marched his men to their borders in a show of force, but without an actual attack, then sent an offer of peace to Running Water. In answer, Dragging Canoe sent a delegation of leaders led by Little Owl to Nashville under a flag of truce to explain that his Cherokee were not the responsible parties. Meanwhile, the attacks continued.\\n\\nAt the time of the conference in Nashville, two Chickasaw out hunting game along the Tennessee in the vicinity of Muscle Shoals chanced upon Coldwater Town, where they were warmly received and spent the night. Upon returning home to Chickasaw Bluffs, now Memphis, Tennessee, they informed their head man, Piomingo, of their discovery. Piomingo then sent runners to Nashville. Just after these runners had arrived in Nashville, a war party attacked one of its outlying settlements, killing Robertson\\'s brother Mark. In response, Robertson raised a group of 150 volunteers and proceeded south by a circuitous land route, guided by two Chickasaw. Somehow catching the town off guard despite the fact they knew Robertson\\'s force was approaching, they chased its defenders to the river, killing about half of them and wounding many of the rest. They then gathered all the trade goods in the town to be shipped to Nashville by boat, burned the town, and departed. After the wars, Coldwater Town became the site of Colbert\\'s Ferry, owned by Chickasaw leader George Colbert, the crossing place of the Natchez Trace over the Tennessee River.\\n\\nSection::::Post-Revolution: Peak of Cherokee influence (1788â1792).\\nSection::::Cherokee-Franklin war (1788â1789).\\nThe conflict between the Cherokee and the Americans in the State of Franklin erupted into its bloodiest and most widespread since 1776, beginning in late spring and lasting well into the beginning of the following year. One important feature of this conflict was the introduction of large numbers of Muscogee warriors fighting in Cherokee war parties, which continued until the end of the Cherokee wars.\\n\\nSection::::Isolated massacres.\\nIn May 1788, a party of Cherokee from Chilhowee came to the house of John Kirk\\'s family on Little River, while he and his oldest son, John Jr., were out. When Kirk and John Jr. returned, they found the other eleven members of their family dead and scalped. This was the beginning of a Cherokee campaign of raids across the region, to which the frontiers people responded by retreating inside forts and stations.\\n\\nIn May 1788, James Brown of North Carolina departed departed Long-Island-on-the-Holston by boat, destined for the Cumberland to settle there. When they passed by Williams Island in Chattanooga, Bloody Fellow stopped them, looked around the boat, then let them proceed, meanwhile sending messengers ahead to Running Water.\\n\\nUpon the family\\'s arrival at Nickajack, a party of 40 under mixed-blood John Vann boarded the boat and killed Col. Brown, his two older sons on the boat, and five other young men traveling with the family. Mrs. Brown, the two younger sons, and three daughters were taken prisoner and distributed to different families. When he learned of the massacre the following day, The Breath, Nickajack\\'s headman, was angered. He later adopted into his own family the Browns\\' son Joseph as a son. Mrs. Brown and one of her daughters were given to the Muscogee and ended up in the personal household of Alex McGillivray.\\n\\nSection::::Franklinite invasion of the Overhill Towns.\\nIn June 1788, John Sevier, no longer governor of the State of Franklin, raised 100 volunteers and set out for the Overhill Towns. After a brief stop at the Little Tennessee, the group went to Great Hiwassee and burned it to the ground. Then they returned to the Little Tennessee and burned down Tallasee. \\n\\nReturning to Chota, Sevier sent a detachment led by James Hubbard to Chilhowee to punish those responsible for the Kirk massacre. Hubbard\\'s force included John Kirk Jr. Hubbard brought along Corntassel and Hanging Man from Chota. At Chilhowee, Hubbard raised a flag of truce and took Corntassel and Hanging Man to the house of Abraham, still headman of the town. He was there with his son, also bringing along Long Fellow and Fool Warrior. Hubbard posted guards at the door and windows of the cabin, and gave John Kirk Jr. a tomahawk to get his revenge.\\n\\nThe murder of the pacifist Overhill chiefs under a flag of truce angered the entire Cherokee nation. Men who had been reluctant to participate took to the warpath. The increase in hostility lasted for several months. Doublehead, Corntassel\\'s brother, was particularly incensed. Not only did the Cherokee from the Overhill Towns join those from the Lower Towns on the warpath, so too did a large number of Muscogee warriors.\\n\\nHighlighting the seriousness of the matter, Dragging Canoe came to address the general council of the Nation, meeting at Ustanali on the Coosawattee River (one of the former Lower Towns on the Keowee River relocated to the vicinity of Calhoun, Georgia) to which the seat of the council had been moved. The council elected Little Turkey as First Beloved Man to succeed the murdered chief. The election was contested by Hanging Maw of Coyatee; he had been elected chief headman of the traditional Overhill Towns on the Little Tennessee. Both men had been among those who originally followed Dragging Canoe into the southwest.\\n\\nSection::::Siege of Houston\\'s Station.\\nIn August 1788, the commander of the garrison at Houston\\'s Station (near the present Maryville, Tennessee) received word that a Cherokee force of nearly 500 was planning to attack his position. He therefore sent a large reconnaissance patrol to the Overhill Towns.\\n\\nStopping in the town of Citico on the south side of the Little Tennessee, which they found deserted, the patrol scattered throughout the town\\'s orchard and began gathering fruit. Six of them died in the first fusilade, another ten while attempting to escape across the river.\\n\\nWith the loss of those men, the garrison at Houston\\'s Station was seriously beleaguered. Only the arrival of a relief force under John Sevier saved the fort from being overrun and its inhabitants slaughtered. With the garrison joining his force, Sevier marched to the Little Tennessee and burned Chilhowee.\\n\\nSection::::Attempted invasion of the Lower Towns.\\nLater in August, Joseph Martin (who was married to Betsy, daughter of Nancy Ward, and living at Chota), with 500 men, marched to the Chickamauga area, intending to penetrate the edge of the Cumberland Mountains to get to the Five Lower Towns. He sent a detachment to secure the pass over the foot of Lookout Mountain, which was ambushed and routed by a large party of Dragging Canoe\\'s warriors, with the Cherokee in hot pursuit. One of the participants later referred to the spot as \"the place where we made the Virginians turn their backs\". According to one of the participants on the other side, Dragging Canoe, John Watts, Bloody Fellow, Kitegisky, The Glass, Little Owl, and Dick Justice were all present at the encounter.\\n\\nDragging Canoe raised an army of 3,000 Cherokee warriors, which he split into more flexible war bands of hundreds of warriors each. One band was headed by John Watts, with Bloody Fellow, Kitegisky, and The Glass. It included a young warrior named Pathkiller, who later became known as The Ridge.\\n\\nSection::::Battles of Gillespie\\'s Station and others.\\nIn October 1788, Watts\\' band advanced across country toward White\\'s Fort. Along the way, they attacked Gillespie\\'s Station on the Holston River after capturing settlers who had left the enclosure to work in the fields, storming the stockade when the defender\\'s ammunition ran out, killing the men and some of the women and taking 28 women and children prisoner. They then proceeded to attack White\\'s Fort and Houston\\'s Station, only to be beaten back. Afterward, the war band wintered at an encampment on the Flint River in present-day Unicoi County, Tennessee as a base of operations.\\n\\nAn attack by another large party against Sherrill\\'s Station on Nolichucky River was driven off by a force commanded by Sevier. In response to the Cherokee incursions, the settlers increased their retaliatory attacks. Troops under Sevier invaded the Middle and Valley Towns in North Carolina.\\n\\nBob Benge, with a group of Cherokee warriors, evacuated the general population from Ustalli, on the Hiwassee; they left a rearguard to ensure their escape. After firing the town, Sevier and his group pursued the fleeing inhabitants, and were ambushed at the mouth of the Valley River by Benge\\'s party.\\n\\nThe U.S. soldiers went to the village of Coota-cloo-hee and burned down its cornfields, but they were chased off by 400 warriors led by Watts (Young Tassel). Watts\\' army trailed Sevier\\'s all the way from Coota-cloo-hee back to the Franklin settlements, attacking at random. Consequently, the Overhill Cherokee and refugees from the Lower and Valley towns virtually abandoned the settlements on the Little Tennessee and dispersed south and west. Chota was the only Overhill town left with many inhabitants.\\n\\nSection::::Council at Coweta.\\nOn March 2, 1789, the Lower Muscogee chief town of Coweta hosted a council between their division of the Muscogee Confederacy and the Cherokee. As town headman, John Galphin, half-blood son of former Indian Commissioner for the United States George Galphin, presided. Dragging Canoe and Hanging Maw led the Cherokee delegation. The representative of the two nations present agreed they trusted neither the Americans nor the Spanish and drafted a letter to the government of Great Britain, pledging their loyalty in return for the king\\'s direct assistance. They promised that if this happened, then the Mohawk, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw would come over. Nothing ever came of the petition.\\n\\nSection::::Prisoner exchange.\\nJohn Watts\\' band on Flint Creek fell upon serious misfortune in January 1789. They were surrounded by a force under John Sevier that was equipped with grasshopper cannons. The gunfire from the Cherokee was so intense, however, that Sevier abandoned his heavy weapons and ordered a cavalry charge that led to savage hand-to-hand fighting. Watt\\'s band lost nearly 150 warriors.\\n\\nWord of their defeat did not reach Running Water until April, when it arrived with an offer from Sevier for an exchange of prisoners which specifically mentioned the surviving members of the Brown family, including Joseph, who had been adopted first by Kitegisky and later by The Breath. Among those captured at Flint Creek were Bloody Fellow and Little Turkey\\'s daughter.\\n\\nJoseph and his sister Polly were brought immediately to Running Water, but when runners were sent to Crow Town to retrieve Jane, their youngest sister, her owner refused to surrender her. Bob Benge, present in Running Water at the time, mounted his horse and hefted his famous axe, saying, \"I will bring the girl, or the owner\\'s head\". The next morning he returned with Jane. The three were handed over to Sevier at Coosawattee on April 20. McGillivray delivered Mrs. Brown and Elizabeth to her son William during a trip to Rock Landing, Georgia, in November. George, the other surviving son from the trip, remained with the Muscogee until 1798.\\n\\nSection::::Non-treaty of Swannanoa.\\nThe next month, on May 25, 1789, the Cherokee were supposed to sign a peace treaty with the United States at the War Ford on the French Broad River, near Swannanoa, North Carolina. The Americans chose the location because it was scene of a major Cherokee defeat in 1776. The Cherokee leaders never showed, but when the Americans under Andrew Pickens ran across Cherokee on their way to Rock Landing on the Oconee River to meet with the Muscogee, they were assured hostilities were over.\\n\\nSection::::Doublehead\\'s war.\\nThe opposite end of Muscle Shoals from Coldwater Town was occupied in 1790 by a roughly 40-strong warrior party under Doublehead. He had gained permission to establish his town at the head of the Shoals, which was in Chickasaw territory, because the local headman, George Colbert, the mixed-blood leader who later owned Colbert\\'s Ferry at the foot of Muscle Shoals, was his son-in-law.\\n\\nLike the former Coldwater Town, Doublehead\\'s Town was diverse, with Cherokee, Muscogee, Shawnee, and a few Chickasaw. It quickly grew beyond the initial 40 warriors, who carried out many small raids against settlers on the Cumberland and into Kentucky. During one foray in June 1792, his warriors ambushed a canoe carrying the three sons of Valentine Sevier (brother of John) and three others on a scouting expedition searching for his party. They killed the three Seviers and another man; two escaped.\\n\\nDoublehead conducted his operations largely independently of the Lower Cherokee, though he did take part in large operations with them on occasion, such as the invasion of the Cumberland in 1792 and that of the Holston in 1793.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty of New York (1790).\\nDragging Canoe\\'s long-time ally among the Muscogee, Alex McGillivray, led a delegation of twenty-seven leaders north, where they signed the Treaty of New York in August 1790 with the United States government on behalf of the \"Upper, Middle, and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians\". In it, McGillivray, who was made an America brigadier general, ceded in the name of the Confederacy the Oconee Country. In return the federal government upheld Muscogee rights to all of the Tallassee Country.\\n\\nAlthough intended to end the Oconee War, it angered the American settlers expelled from the Tallassee Country and Muscogee who wanted to keep the Oconee Country, so the war continued. The treaty also marked the beginning of the decline of McGillivray\\'s influence in the Muscogee Confederacy and the rise of that of William Augustus Bowles, a bitter rival dating back to the Spanish campaign against Pensacola. By mid-1791, Bowles wielded enough influence to send large war parties raiding the Cumberland once again despite the treaty.\\n\\nSection::::Muscle Shoals settlement.\\nIn January 1791, a group of land speculators named the Tennessee Company from the Southwest Territory, led by James Hubbard and Peter Bryant, attempted to gain control of the Muscle Shoals and its vicinity by building a settlement and fort at the head of the Shoals. They did so against an executive order of President Washington forbidding it, as relayed to them by the governor of the Southwest Territory, William Blount. The Glass came down from Running Water with 60 warriors and descended upon the defenders, captained by Valentine Sevier, brother of John. The Glass told them to leave immediately or be killed, then burned their blockhouse as they departed.\\n\\nSection::::Bob Benge\\'s war.\\nStarting in 1791, Benge and his brother The Tail, based at Willstown, began leading attacks against settlers in East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and Kentucky, often in conjunction with Doublehead and his warriors from Coldwater. Eventually, he became one of the most feared warriors on the frontier.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty of Holston (1791).\\nThe Treaty of Holston, signed in July 1791, required the Upper Towns to cede more land in return for continued peace because the U.S. government proved unable to stop or roll back illegal settlements. As it appeared to guarantee Cherokee sovereignty, the chiefs of the Upper Cherokee believed they had the same status as states. Several representatives of the Lower Cherokee participated in the negotiations and signed the treaty, including John Watts, Doublehead, Bloody Fellow, Black Fox (Dragging Canoe\\'s nephew), The Badger (his brother), and Rising Fawn.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of the Wabash.\\nLater in the summer, a small delegation of Cherokee under Dragging Canoe\\'s brother Little Owl traveled north to meet with the Indian leaders of the Western Confederacy, chief among them Blue Jacket of the Shawnee, Little Turtle of the Miami, and Buckongahelas of the Lenape. While they were there, word arrived that Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory, was planning an invasion against the allied tribes in the north. Little Owl immediately sent word south to Running Water.\\n\\nDragging Canoe quickly sent a 30-strong war party north under his brother The Badger, where, along with the warriors of Little Owl and Turtle-at-Home they participated in the decisive encounter in November 1791 known as the Battle of the Wabash, the worst defeat ever inflicted by Native Americans upon the American military, the American military body count of which far surpassed that at the more famous Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.\\n\\nAfter the battle, Little Owl, The Badger, and Turtle-at-Home returned south with most of the warriors who had accompanied the first two. The warriors who had come north years earlier remained in the Ohio region, but the returning warriors brought back a party of 30 Shawnee under the leadership of one known as Shawnee Warrior that frequently operated alongside warriors under Little Owl.\\n\\nSection::::Death of Dragging Canoe.\\nInspired by news of the northern victory, Dragging Canoe embarked on a mission to unite the native people of his area as had Little Turtle and Blue Jacket by visiting the other major tribes in the region. His embassies to the Lower Muscogee and the Choctaw were successful, but the Chickasaw living to the west refused his overtures. Upon his return, which coincided with that of The Glass and Dick Justice, and of Turtle-at-Home, a huge all-night celebration was held at Stecoyee at which the Eagle Dance was performed in his honor.\\n\\nBy the morning of March 1, 1792, Dragging Canoe was dead, as a result of exhaustion from dancing all night, or possibly a heart attack. A procession of honor carried his body to Running Water, where he was buried. By the time of his death, the resistance of the Chickamauga/Lower Cherokee had led to grudging respect from the settlers, as well as the rest of the Cherokee nation. He was even memorialized at the general council of the Nation held in Ustanali on June 28, 1792, by his nephew Black Fox:\\n\\n\"The Dragging Canoe has left this world. He was a man of consequence in his country. He was friend to both his own and the white people. His brother\" [Little Owl] \"is still in place, and I mention it now publicly that I intend presenting him with his deceased brother\\'s medal; for he promises fair to possess sentiments similar to those of his brother, both with regard to the red and the white. It is mentioned here publicly that both red and white may know it, and pay attention to him\".\\n\\nThe minutes of the council list Little Turkey as \"Great Beloved Man of the whole Nation\", Hanging Maw as \"Beloved Man of the Northern Division\" (Overhill Towns), and The Badger as \"Beloved Man of the Southern Division\" (Upper Towns in North Georgia).\\n\\nSuch was the respect for him as a leader and patriot of his people that Governor Blount, leader of his greatest enemies, remarked upon hearing of his death that, \"Dragging Canoe stood second to none in the Nation\".\\n\\nSection::::Post-Revolution: the Watts years (1792â1795).\\nAt his own previous request, Dragging Canoe was succeeded as leader of the Lower Cherokee by John Watts, although The Bowl succeeded him as headman of Running Water. Bloody Fellow and Doublehead continued Dragging Canoe\\'s policy of Indian unity, including an agreement with McGillivray of the Upper Muscogee to build joint blockhouses from which warriors of both tribes could operate at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers, at Running Water and at Muscle Shoals.\\n\\nWatts, Tahlonteeskee, and \\'Young Dragging Canoe\\' (whose actual name was \"Tsula\", or \"Red Fox\") traveled to Pensacola in May at the invitation of Arturo O\\'Neill de Tyrone, Spanish governor of West Florida. They took with them letters of introduction from John McDonald. Once there, they forged a treaty with O\\'Neill for arms and supplies. Upon returning north, Watts moved his base of operations to Willstown.\\n\\nMeanwhile, John McDonald, now British Indian Affairs Superintendent, moved to Turkeytown with his assistant Daniel Ross and their families. Some of the older chiefs, such as The Glass of Running Water, The Breath of Nickajack, and Dick Justice of Stecoyee, abstained from active warfare but did nothing to stop the warriors in their towns from taking part in raids and campaigns.\\n\\nThe Trans-Appalachian communities formerly of North Carolina became the Southwest Territory of the United States in 1790. For administrative purposes, the territorial government grouped the counties in the Overmountain region together as the Washington District, while those in the Cumberland region became the Mero District, already the name for its judicial district since 1788.\\n\\nCherokee and Muscogee warriors and their Shawnee guests began raiding both districts of the Southwest Territory. In April 1792, a Cherokee-Shawnee war party led by Bob Benge and Shawnee Warrior invaded the Holston region and began raids all over the vicinity. In the summer of 1792, a war party from Running Water led by Little Owl and the Shawnee Warrior joined them in their raids. On June 26, the same day that Dragging Canoe was being memorialized at the national council in Ustanali, the combined group of Cherokee, Shawnee, and a few Muscogee destroyed Zeigler\\'s Station in Sumner County. This action led the Governor James Robertson of the Mero District to call up a battalion of troops to spread throughout the region as guards.\\n\\nSection::::Invasion of the Mero District.\\nOn September 7 or 8, 1792, a council of Cherokee meeting at Running Water formally declared war against the United States. Watts orchestrated a large campaign intending to attack the Washington District with a large combined army in four bands of 200 each. When the warriors were mustering at Stecoyee, however, he learned that their planned attack was expected and decided to aim for the Mero District instead. The army Watts led into the Cumberland region was nearly 1,000 strong, including a contingent of cavalry.\\n\\nFrom their launch point, Tahlonteeskee (Doublehead\\'s brother) and The Tail (Bob Benge\\'s brother) led a party to ambush the Kentucky Road. Doublehead led another to the Cumberland Road. Middle Striker led his party to do the same on the Walton Road. Watts led the main force, made up of 280 Cherokee, Shawnee, and Muscogee warriors plus cavalry, intending to go against the fort at Nashville. He sent out George Fields and John Walker, Jr., as scouts ahead of the army, and they killed the two scouts sent out by James Robertson from Nashville.\\n\\nNear their target on the evening of September 30, Watts\\'s combined force came upon a small fort known as Buchanan\\'s Station, commanded by John Buchanan. Talotiskee, leader of the Muscogee, wanted to attack it immediately, while Watts argued in favor of saving it for the return south. After much bickering, Watts gave in around midnight. The assault proved to be a disaster for Watts. Watts was wounded, and many of his warriors were killed, including Talotiskee and some of Watts\\' best leaders; Shawnee Warrior, Kitegisky, and Dragging Canoe\\'s brother Little Owl were among those who died in the encounter.\\n\\nDoublehead\\'s group of 60 ambushed a party of 6 and took one scalp then headed toward Nashville. On their way, they were attacked by a militia force and lost 13 men. Tahlonteeskee\\'s party, meanwhile, stayed out into early October, attacking Black\\'s Station on Crooked Creek, killing three, wounding more, and capturing several horses. Middle Striker\\'s party ambushed a large armed force coming to the Mero District down the Walton Road in November and routed it completely without losing a single man.\\n\\nIn revenge for the deaths at Buchanan\\'s Station, Benge, Doublehead, and his brother Pumpkin Boy led a party of 60 into southwestern Kentucky in early 1793 during which their warriors, in an act initiated by Doublehead, cooked and ate the enemies they had just killed. Afterwards, Doublehead\\'s party returned south and held scalp dances at Stecoyee, Turnip Town, and Willstown, since warriors from those towns had also participated in the raid in addition to his and Benge\\'s groups.\\n\\nSection::::Spring and summer campaigns, 1793.\\nA party of Muscogee under a mixed-race warrior named Lesley began attacking isolated farmsteads. Lesley\\'s party continued harassment of the Holston settlements until the summer of 1794. Lesley\\'s group was not the only Muscogee party, nor were the Muscogee alone. Warriors from the Upper Towns and some from the Overhill and Valley Towns, also raided the eastern districts in the spring and summer of 1793.\\n\\nIn the Mero District, besides scalping raids, two parties attacked Bledsoe\\'s Station and Greenfield Station in April 1793. Another party attacked Hays\\' Station in June. In August, the Coushatta from Coosada raided the country around Clarksville, Tennessee, attacking the homestead of the Baker family, killing all but two who escaped and one taken prisoner who was later ransomed at Coosada Town.\\n\\nSection::::Peace overtures.\\nAfter the visit of the Shawnee, Watts sent envoys to Knoxville, then the capital of the Southwest Territory, to meet with Governor William Blount to discuss terms for peace. The party that was sent from the Lower Towns that May included Bob McLemore, Tahlonteeskee, Captain Charley of Running Water, and Doublehead, among several others. They met at Henry\\'s Station on February 4, 1793, and Blount invited the Lower Cherokee to send a delegation to the Philadelphia to meet with President Washington.\\nThe meeting in Philadelphia was scheduled for June 1793. On the way, the diplomatic party from the Lower Towns stopped in Coyatee because Hanging Maw and other chiefs from the Upper Towns were going also. A large party of Lower Cherokee had been raiding the Upper East, killed two men, and stole twenty horses. On their way out, they passed through Coyatee, to which the pursuit party tracked them. \\n\\nThe militia violated their orders not to cross the Little Tennessee, then the border between the Cherokee nation and the Southwest Territory, firing indiscriminately. In the ensuing chaos, 11 leading men were killed, including Captain Charley, and several wounded, including Hanging Maw, his wife and daughter, Doublehead, and Tahlonteeskee; one of the white delegates was among the dead. The Cherokee, including Watts\\' hostile warriors, agreed to await the outcome of the subsequent trial. The trial proved to be a farce, in large part because John Beard, the man responsible, was a close friend of John Sevier.\\n\\nSection::::Invasion of the Eastern Districts.\\nWatts responded to Beard\\'s acquittal by invading the Holston area with one of the largest Indian forces ever seen in the region, over 1,000 Cherokee and Muscogee, plus a few Shawnee, intending to attack Knoxville. The plan was to have four bodies of troops march toward Knoxville separately, converging at a rendezvous point along the way.\\n\\nIn August, Watts attacked Henry\\'s Station with a force of 200 but fell back after sustaining overwhelming gunfire coming from the fort. The four columns converged a month later near the present Loudon, Tennessee, and proceeded toward their target. On the way, the Cherokee leaders were discussing among themselves whether to kill all the inhabitants of Knoxville, or just the men, James Vann advocating the latter while Doublehead argued for the former.\\n\\nFurther on the way, they encountered a small settlement called Cavett\\'s Station on September 25, 1793. After they had surrounded the place, Benge negotiated with the inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead\\'s group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing them, over the pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy\\'s skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.\\n\\nBecause of this incident, Vann called Doublehead \"Babykiller\" (deliberately parodying the honorable title \"Mankiller\") for the remainder of his life; and it also began a lengthy feud which defined the politics of the early 19th century Cherokee Nation and only ended in 1807 with Doublehead\\'s death at Vann\\'s orders. By this time, tensions among the Cherokee broke out into such vehement arguments that the force broke up, with the main group retiring south.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of Hightower.\\nSevier countered the invasion with an invasion and occupation of Ustanali, which had been deserted; there was no fighting there other than an indecisive skirmish with a Cherokee-Muscogee scouting party. He and his men then followed the Cherokee-Muscogee force south to the town of Etowah (near the site of present-day Cartersville, Georgia across the Etowah River from the Etowah Indian Mounds), leading to the \"Battle of Hightower\" on October 17, 1793. His force defeated their opponents soundly, then went on to destroy several Cherokee villages to the west before retiring to the Southwest Territory. The battle was the last pitched battle of the wars between the Cherokee and the American frontier people.\\n\\nSection::::Spring and summer 1794.\\nBetween January and September 1794, there were more than forty raids by war parties of both Cherokee and Muscogee on the Mero District. On the part of the Cherokee, these were mostly carried out by Doublehead. These raids precipitated the Nickajack Expedition in September which ended the CherokeeâAmerican wars once and for all.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Bob Benge attacked Washington District and Southwest Virginia, losing his life in the latter on April 6, 1794. The militia sent his red-haired scalp to Governor Henry Lee III. Benge was not alone in raiding the Eastern Districts. Fifty horses were stolen in the region that same month. Twenty-five warriors attacked the Town Creek blockhouse. An entire family save one was massacred south of the French Broad. There were many other attacks.\\n\\nFrustrated with the governor\\'s call for restraint, John Beard, leader of the chase group that attacked the diplomatic party, organized a party of 150 men in the Washington District and attacked the Hiwasee Towns, burning two, including Great Hiwassee, and killing several Cherokee. Against orders, George Doherty of the Hamilton District militia mustered his men and attacked Great Tellico, burning it to the ground, then crossed the mountains into the Valley Towns, in which they burned at least two towns and several acres of crops.\\n\\nOn June 9, 1794, a party of Cherokee under Whitemankiller (George Fields) overtook a river party under William Scott at Muscle Shoals. They killed its white passengers, looted the goods, and took the African-American slaves as captives.\\n\\nOn June 26, 1794, the federal government and the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Philadelphia, which essentially reaffirmed the land cessions of the 1785 Treaty of Hopwell and the 1791 Treaty of Holston. Both the Doublehead and Bloody Fellow signed it.\\n\\nSection::::End of Lesley\\'s war party.\\nIn July 1794, Hanging Maw sent his men along with the volunteers from the Holston settlements to pursue Lesley\\'s Muscogee war party, killing two and handing over a third to the whites for trial and execution on August 4. Two days later, a small war party of Muscogee crossed the Tennessee River at Chestua Creek in modern Bradley County. Hanging Maw called up his warriors, 50 of whom joined with federal troops in pursuit, while the rest guarded Coyatee. They caught up with the party they were pursuing on August 12 near Craig\\'s Station and defeated them. Different Muscogee war parties, however, escaped their pursuers and attacked the Holston frontier for the rest of the month.\\n\\nSection::::Nickajack Expedition and peace treaty.\\nDesiring to end the wars once and for all, Robertson sent a detachment of U.S. regular troops, Mero District militia, and Kentucky volunteers to the Five Lower Towns under U.S. Army Major James Ore. Guided by knowledgeable locals, including former captive Joseph Brown, Ore\\'s army traveled down the Cisca and St. Augustine Trail toward the Five Lower Towns.\\n\\nOn September 13, the army attacked Nickajack without warning, slaughtering many of the inhabitants, including its pacifist chief The Breath. After torching the houses, the soldiers went upriver and burned Running Water, whose residents had long fled. Joseph Brown fought alongside the soldiers but tried to spare women and children. The Cherokee casualties were relatively light, as the majority of the population of both towns were in Willstown attending a major stickball game.\\n\\nWatts finally decided to call for peace: he was discouraged by the destruction of the two towns, the death of Bob Benge in April, and the recent defeat of the Western Confederacy by General \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne\\'s army at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. More than 100 Cherokee had fought there. The loss of support from the Spanish, who had their own problems against France in the War of the First Coalition, convinced Watts to end the fighting. \\n\\nOn November 7, 1794, he made the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. It was notable for not requiring any more land cessions by the Cherokee, other than finally ended the series of conflicts, which was notable for not requiring any further cession of land other than requiring the Lower Cherokee to recognize the cessions of the Holston Treaty. This led to a period of relative peace into the 19th century.\\n\\nThe Muscogee kept on fighting after the destruction of Nickajack and Running Water and the following peace between the Lower Cherokee and the United States. In October 1794, they attacked Bledsoe\\'s Station again. In November, they attacked Sevier\\'s Station and massacred fourteen of the inhabitants, Valentine Sevier being one of the few survivors.\\n\\nIn December 1794, a force of Cherokee warriors from the Upper Towns stopped a Muscogee campaign against the frontier settlements of the state of Georgia and warned them to cease attacking the Southwest Territory\\'s Eastern Districts as well. In early January 1795, however, the Chickasaw, who had sent warriors to take part in the Army of the Northwest, began killing Muscogee warriors found in Middle Tennessee as allies of the United States and taking their scalps, so in March, the Muscogee began to turn their attentions away from the Cumberland to the Chickasaw, over the entreaties of the Cherokee and the Choctaw.\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath.\\nFollowing the peace treaty, leaders from the Lower Cherokee were dominant in national affairs. When the national government of all the Cherokee was organized, the first three persons to hold the office of Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation â Little Turkey (1788â1801), Black Fox (1801â1811), and Pathkiller (1811â1827) â had previously served as warriors under Dragging Canoe, as had the first two Speakers of the Cherokee National Council, established in 1794, Doublehead and Turtle-at-Home.\\n\\nThe domination of the Cherokee Nation by the former warriors from the Lower Towns continued well into the 19th century. Even after the revolt of the young chiefs of the Upper Towns, the Lower Towns were a major voice, and the \"young chiefs\" of the Upper Towns who dominated that region had themselves previously been warriors with Dragging Canoe and Watts.\\n\\nBecause of the continuing hostilities that followed the Revolution, the United States placed one of the two permanent garrisons of the new country at Fort Southwest Point at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers; the other was at Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'CherokeeâAmerican wars', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7666345'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'lQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7670', 'text': 'Central Coast\\n\\nCentral Coast may refer to:\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Central Coast', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7670', 'cat_id': '7670', 'cat_title': '1574_births', 'cat_pages': '133', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'lgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7670177', 'text': \"Dermot Keely\\n\\nDermot Keely (born 8 March 1954) is an Irish former manager and player.\\n\\nSection::::Family.\\nKeely's family have played League of Ireland football at various levels. His late father Peter Keely played for Shelbourne, his brother Joe played on the same Home Farm FAI Cup winning side of 1975 as Dermot himself. And his son Alan Keely also played in the League of Ireland.\\n\\nSection::::Player.\\nAs a player Keely started with Home Farm and then signed for St. Patrick's Athletic under Barry Bridges who appointed him club captain. He played with Terry Venables while at Richmond Park (football ground). In June 1977 he was about to depart for Adelaide on a 2-year contract when the deal fell through.\\n\\nHe then moved to Dundalk where he made his debut against Shamrock Rovers in September 1978. In his first season the County Louth outfit won the domestic double. In 1981 Keely captained Dundalk to win the FAI Cup. The League Cup was also won this season.\\n\\nKeely then signed for Glentoran in the Irish League where in his two seasons there he won the Irish Cup, a Gold Cup and an Ulster Cup.\\n\\nKeely's time with Dundalk and Glentoran saw him play in notable European Cup ties. In 1979, Dundalk reached the second round of the 1979â80 European Cup and were drawn with Celtic. The first leg saw Dundalk produce a notable display to come away with a 3â2 defeat at Parkhead. In the return leg in front of a packed Oriel Park with Keely as captain, Dundalk missed a last-minute opportunity to win the tie on away goals and the game finished 0â0 . This is regarded as one of the best performances by a League of Ireland club in European competition.\\n\\nTwo years later, Keely played his part in Glentoran's run to the second round of the European Cup. In the first leg against CSKA Sofia, they lost 2â0. However, the return leg saw Glentoran take a 2â0 lead, forcing the game into extra time. With only five minutes remaining, CSKA scored the goal they needed. The tie finished 3â2 on aggregate, which had been the closest Glentoran came to reaching the last eight of European competition since 1974.\\n\\nSection::::Player-manager.\\nKeely's first managerial job was as UCD player-manager. However, after just two months at Belfield Jim McLaughlin (football manager) persuaded Keely to sign for Shamrock Rovers. He made his debut against Athlone Town in November 1983. He scored his first goal for Rovers in a 3â2 defeat to Shelbourne at Harold's Cross on 11 December 1983. When McLaughlin left at the end of the 1985/86 season to manage his home club Derry City Dermot was appointed player-manager on 16 May.\\n\\nIn the 1986/87 season, Rovers owners controversially announced the sale of Glenmalure Park near the end of season. However, Rovers won another double in this their final season at Milltown to bring Keely's Rovers haul to 4 League championships and 3 FAI Cups.\\n\\nThe 1987/88 season started with Rovers controversially playing at Tolka Park. Rovers fans boycotted the ground en masse. Every game was picketed and with the crowds practically gone the team invariably suffered. Keely was quoted years later as saying: \\n\\nHe resigned after the last game of the season on 8 April 1988. During his time at Rovers he won one Inter-League cap and represented the club 6 times in European competition.\\n\\nIn May 1988 Keely signed for Bray Wanderers However, he never played for the Seasiders and by November Keely was player/assistant manager to Ray Treacy at Home Farm F.C..\\n\\nSection::::Manager.\\nHe then took over as manager of Sligo Rovers in 1989 and achieved promotion in his first season. He guided Sligo Rovers to their highest Premier Division place in a decade in the 1990/91 season by finishing 5th.\\n\\nAfter a brief spell at Longford Town he took over at Dundalk where he won the League Championship in 1995. He then guided Finn Harps to promotion to the Premier Division in 1996. After managing Athlone Town he took over the reins at Home Farm Everton where he won the League of Ireland First Division Shield in 1998.\\n\\nIn the calendar year 1996 Keely managed four clubs: Dundalk, Finn Harps, Athlone Town and Home Farm.\\nHe took over as manager of Shelbourne in July 1998 and won two championships (1999â2000 and 2001â02) and one FAI Cup (2000) in his time at Tolka Park. He also guided Shels to victory over Macedonian side Sloga Jugomagnat in the first round of the 2000â01 UEFA Champions League qualifiers. Shels 1â0 win in the first leg in Skopje was the first away win for a League of Ireland side in any UEFA competitions for eighteen years.\\n\\nKeely then became the first manager of new league club Kildare County in 2002. After a credible 5th-place finish he then walked out to manage Derry City lasting only 3 months\\n\\nAfter a spell out of the game he then took over at Dublin City. He then took over the management position at Shelbourne FC in 2007 and in his first season back finished fifth in the first division. In his second season in charge, Shelbourne lead the division going into the final game, and needed a home win against mid-table Limerick to gain promotion, but were denied by a 92nd-minute equaliser, and so were overhauled by Dundalk, who won away to Kildare County. On 27 May 2010, Keely stepped down as manager of Shelbourne to become Shelbourne's youth team manager and community development officer.\\n\\nKeely has also been working as a Maths and English teacher in De La Salle College Churchtown for over 20 years until he retired at Christmas 2011 he also has a weekly column in the Irish Sun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Dermot Keely', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7670177'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'lwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7671062', 'text': 'Real estate owned\\n\\nReal estate owned or REO is a term used in the United States to describe a class of property owned by a lenderâtypically a bank, government agency, or government loan insurerâafter an unsuccessful sale at a foreclosure auction. A foreclosing beneficiary will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high loan-to-value mortgage following a real estate bubble. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset. (See \"non-performing asset\").\\n\\nSection::::Origin.\\nThe term originates from the term \"other real estate owned\" (OREO), which is used on financial statements to classify real estate property owned by a financial institution but which is not directly related to its business. These financial institutions are often the lender. Lenders are primarily in the business of making loans with the intent that nearly all of those loans will be repaid in full with interest. Seizing, managing and reselling real property collateral to recover unpaid loan balances is secondary to lenders\\' primary line of business. Property management companies, for whom real estate management \"is\" their primary business, use the term OREO. \\n\\nIn balance sheet terms, OREO assets are considered non-earning assets for purposes of regulatory accounting. In the context of national banks in the U.S., the term OREO is legally defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in regulations promulgated pursuant to , specifically in and .\\n\\nSection::::Process.\\nAs soon as a property goes into a distressed status (the borrower/home owner misses mortgage payments) the beneficiary will want to determine the amount of equity that the property has. A popular method to determine the equity is to obtain a Broker\\'s Price Opinion (BPO) or order an appraisal. Based on the amount of equity that is determined from the BPO, the bank will decide whether to allow a short sale (if requested by the homeowner). If no short sale is requested by the home owner, the beneficiary will continue the foreclosure process. If the beneficiary is unable to sell the property through a short sale or at a foreclosure auction it will now become an REO property. \\n\\nAfter a repossession from which the property becomes classified as REO, the beneficiary will go through the process of trying to sell the property on its own or obtain the service of an REO Asset Manager. The beneficiary will remove the liens and other debts on the home and try to resell it to the public, either through future auctions, direct marketing through a real estate broker, or by itself. The asset manager may also try to contact REO realtors that specialize in certain ZIP codes to help sell this bank owned property. Real estate investors will often purchase these properties because of discounts offered to compensate for the condition of the property.\\n\\nMany larger banks and government institutions have REO/asset management departments that field bids and offers, oversee up keep, and handle sales. Some REO properties on the open market will be listed in MLS by the broker who performed the BPO. \\n\\nSection::::Property preservation.\\nBank REO properties are generally in poor condition and need repairs and maintenance, both to satisfy property upkeep laws and to preserve and prepare the property for sale. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the mortgage servicer and is often in turn provided by a specialized property preservation company. These \"property preservation services\" include: securing a property (changing locks, boarding up), debris removal, property maintenance (winterizing, cutting grass, repairing or tarping roof leaks), and rehabilitation.\\n\\nIn addition to preventing damage to the property, securing a property is used to prevent or discourage re-entry by former occupants or by squatters, which can both damage the property and require legal proceedings to remove, further complicating a sale. Swimming pools must also be secured to prevent deaths or injuries from drowning and falls.\\n\\nLenders may purchase \"real estate owned\" insurance to protect against loss and liability relating to lender-owned properties. REO insurance differs from \"forced placed\" insurance (also \"lender placed\" insurance), which a lender purchases for borrower-owned property when the borrower does not insure the property.\\n\\nSection::::Bulk real estate owned.\\nBulk REO or bulk real estate owned, from a real estate investorâs point of view, is like investing on wholesale real estate properties. On the other hand, banks or lenders sell or open their assets in group for auction at a very low price compared to their market value. \\n', 'title': 'Real estate owned', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7671062'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'mAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7673868', 'text': \"Francisco 'Paco' Bautista\\n\\nFrancisco 'Paco' Bautista is an IFBB professional bodybuilder.

The brig was \"Resolution\", a sloop of war, of 18 guns and 149 men, under the command of Don Francisco Darrichena. She was the former British navy cutter \"Resolution\" and had sailed from Vera Cruz three days earlier. After securing the prize, \"Apollo\" set out after the xebec, sighting her an hour after daybreak. \"Apollo\" finally captured the xebec \"Marte\", of 75 tons, at three in the afternoon. She had been sailing from Vera Cruz for Havana. \"Apollo\" towed \"Resolution\" until 27 November, when she lost her mast. \"Resolution\" was in such an irreparable state Halkett destroyed her. Then on 7 December \"Apollo\" captured the schooner \"St Joseph\", of 70 tons.\\n\\nIn addition to these three vessels, between 3 August 1800 and 3 January 1801, \"Apollo\" captured two other Spanish merchant vessels:\\n\\nOn 18 February 1801, \"Apollo\" captured the French 14-gun privateer \"Vigilante\". \\n\\nHead money for \"Aquilla\", \"Cantabria\" and \"Vigilante\" was paid in August 1828.

At 3:30 in the morning of 2 April, \"Apollo\" unexpectedly ran aground when their calculations showed them well offshore. In the morning \"Apollo\" discovered that she had run aground about nine miles south of Cape Mondego on the coast of Portugal. Twenty-five or six of the vessels in the convoy, traveling closely behind due to the low visibility and bad weather, were also wrecked. Next day some more vessels wrecked. In all, 29 vessels ran aground. \\n\\nAll the boats of the frigate were destroyed, and it took two days to transfer \"Apollo\"s crew to land. Sixty-two officers and men died; around twenty of the crew died in the first few hours, but most perished of exposure waiting to be rescued. The number of dead in the merchant vessels is not known, but the \"Naval Chronicle\" reported that \"dead bodies were every day floating ashore, and pieces of wreck covered the beach upwards of ten miles.\" \\n\\n\"Carysfort\" had shifted course on the evening of 1 April, and so escaped grounding. She gathered the 38 surviving vessels and proceeded with the convoy.\\n\\nAt the time, accounts blamed strong currents. Later it was discovered that \"Apollo\" had taken on board an iron tank, but that no one had adjusted her compass for the influence of this large magnetic mass. Consequently, a small error in direction accumulated over the course of the five days; at the time \"Apollo\" struck Dixon thought she was forty or so miles out to sea. Because the convoy had endured bad weather since leaving Cork, no one had taken sightings that would have enabled them to correct their estimates of their position.

He succeeded his uncle-in-law Guo Wei, whose surname he had adopted.\\n\\nEmperor Shizong is considered a highly successful emperor of the Five Dynasties period. He centralized military power by his reforms, and proved his military prowess by a series of victories against Northern Han, Later Shu, Southern Tang, and the Liao Dynasty. Although his accomplishments were limited due to his premature death, they paved way for Chinese reunification later completed by the Song Dynasty, founded by his trusted general Zhao Kuangyin.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nChai Rong was born in Xingzhou (é¢å·; modern Xingtai, Hebei). As a child he came to live with his aunt â a younger sister of his father Chai Shouli (æ´å®ç¦®) â and her husband Guo Wei, an official in the Later Tang military. The Guos had no sons, so they adopted the quiet nephew as their own. The youngster grew up into a muscular young man skilled at mounted archery, while also possessing a basic understanding of Chinese classics, history, and the Huang-Lao philosophy.\\n\\nSection::::Career under Later Han.\\nAfter the establishment of the Later Han in 947, the Guo family's condition improved dramatically. Guo Wei became the commissioner of military affairs (æ¨å¯ä½¿) in 948, and his adopted son became the left commandant for palace-gate security (å·¦å éè¡å°è»). On 4 May 950, Guo was promoted to military governor of Tianxiong Command (å¤©éè») and delegated to garrison at Weizhou (é­å·; modern Linzhang County, Hebei) at the Later Han-Liao Dynasty border to prevent a possible Liao incursion. Ten days later, his adopted son was appointed Tianxiong Command's chief director of military headquarters (çå§é½ææ®ä½¿) to follow him in Weizhou. Chai Rong â by now known as Guo Rong â was also given a nominal post of prefect of Guizhou (è²´å·).\\n\\nIn 950, the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou unexpectedly killed the entire family of Guo Wei as a plot to liquidate the most powerful ministers in his nation. Guo Wei decided to rebel. As Guo Rong's wife Lady Liu (åæ°) and children including 3 young sons also remained in the capital Bianzhou (æ±´å·; today's Kaifeng, Henan), they were all slaughtered as well. Guo Wei asked Guo Rong to stay behind at the frontier as he led his main army southbound towards Bianzhou.\\n\\nSection::::Career under Emperor Taizu of Later Zhou.\\nIn a few months, Liu Chengyou was killed, Later Han was terminated, as Guo Wei founded the Later Zhou. Guo Rong became the military governor of Zhenning Command (é®å¯§è») and went to Chanzhou (æ¾¶å·; today's Qingfeng County, Henan). At Chanzhou, he quickly eradicated militarized outlaws in the region and promoted literati to enforce laws more effectively, winning the support of the people. He also initiated projects to tear down dilapidated street walls and build new public office buildings and residential housings.\\n\\nChancellor Wang Jun, the most powerful minister, did not see eye-to-eye with Guo Rong on some issues and prevented him from visiting the capital on more than one occasion. In 952, Guo Rong requested permission to lead an army to quell a rebellion, but Wang Jun vetoed it for fear that Guo Rong would hold too much military power. At the end, Guo Wei had to personally lead the troops as an emperor. It was not until Wang's banishment in early 953 that Guo Rong finally got a chance to come back to the capital, when in April 953 he was named Prince of Jin (æç). By this time he was again married, to a Lady Fu, a widowed daughter of general Fu Yanqing. His son Chai Zongxun was born in late 953 in Chanzhou.\\n\\nSection::::Emperor of Later Zhou.\\nGuo Rong (posthumously known as Shizong of Later Zhou) became emperor in 954 upon his adoptive fatherâs death. Like his father, he was considered an able ruler. He continued reforms introduced by his father. More importantly, he began putting pressure on the Northern Han and even the Liao Dynasty, though nothing substantial came of it. More success was met in the south as some minor successes were made against the Southern Tang and Later Shu, paving the way to eventual unification by the Song Dynasty.\\n\\nSection::::Campaign against Liu Chong.\\nOne month after Chai Rong took the throne, Liu Chong, Emperor of Northern Han, colluded with Liao Dynasty to launch an assault on Later Zhou. Against the advice of Minister Feng Dao, Chai Rong decided to lead the army to fight against the incursion. When Chai Rong engaged Liu Chong at Gao Ping (in modern Jincheng), two of Chai's general Fan Aineng, He Hui fled from battlefield along with their troops. At this critical moment, Chai Rong risked his life to break through the defense and crushed Liuâs forces. After this campaign, Chai Rong consolidated his power.\\n\\nHe suffered an early death at the age of 38 when he died from illness while out on the field in 959. He left behind him a six-year-old heir to succeed him. This led to the fall of the dynasty and the rise of the Song Dynasty, which eventually succeeded in reunifying China.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Chai Rong', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7685714'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ngE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7686358', 'text': 'The Beat Continues\\n\\n\"The Beat Continues\" is the big band Entre\\'act overture from the musical \"Over Here!\", which opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre (Broadway) on March 6, 1974.

Baseball NT was formed in 1968 under its original name, the Northern Territory Baseball League. Baseball NT is governed nationally by the Australian Baseball Federation. Historically, baseball in Australia and the Northern Territory has been an amateur sport.\\n\\nSection::::Overview.\\nOrganised baseball is played in Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine. Darwin has four clubs; Nightcliff Tigers, Palmerston Reds, Pints and Tracy Village Rebels. The East Darwin Beasts disbanded in 1987 and the South Darwin Rabbitohs disbanded in 2004. In Darwin, baseball is a dry-season sport, played between April and September each year. Baseball in Darwin is controlled by the Darwin Baseball Association.\\n\\nThe Katherine Baseball Association has four teams; Dodgers, Cubs, Angels and Braves. The sport is usually played between the months of February through to September, during the dry season. Predominantly, only under seventeen competitions are played due to a lack of interested players. Although a high percentage of participating players are successful in making local squads and Territory/ state teams.\\n\\nAlice Springs has six teams; Bulls, Cubs, Demons, Panthers, Redbacks and Venom. In Alice Springs, baseball is a summer sport, usually played between October and March. Baseball in Alice Springs is controlled by the Alice Springs Baseball Association.\\n\\nThe Northern Territory competed in the national Claxton Shield competition between 1981 and 1989. During its nine-year admittance, the Northern Territory won only one game, in 1987, against South Australia with a score of 20-11. Bill Hutcheson, a Catcher, from originally Tennant Creek and later Darwin, was the only player to play in all nine Claxton Shields. He was also the first Territorian to hit a home run in 1984, against Victoria.\\n\\nIn 1991, the Territory joined the national Australian Provincial Championship (also known as the Commonwealth Cup) competition for regional Australian baseball. Bill Fryar became the first Territorian to hit a home run in 1992, against Queensland. In 1999, the Northern Territory won the Cup for the first time under the leadership of player/coach, Andrew Kendray.\\n\\nSuccess for the Northern Territory is difficult as promising juniors are attracted away from the Territory to pursue careers in the southern leagues where their development and opportunities are greater. Several Territorian home-grown players have gone onto successful baseball careers and these most notably include Greg Mosel, Max Hardy, Jon Mellor, Lachlan Burrows, Darren Welch, Wilson Lee, Sam Tibbits, Dushan Ruzic and Adrian Burnside. Rarely do these players return to the Northern Territory. This has created a catch 22 situation for Baseball NT whereby it understands that by developing home-grown talent, there is a good possibility these players will be lost to southern leagues, unlikely to return to the Northern Territory. \\n\\nIn November 1983 however, Territory players were selected to play for Australia against the touring Japanese Industrial League champions, Toshiba, and included, Bill Fryar and Laurie Moore from Darwin; John Baldock from Tennant Creek and Darren Welch from Alice Springs.\\n\\nSince the late 1990s, the popularity and standard of baseball in the Northern Territory has steadily declined as it struggles to compete against Australian icon sports such as cricket, as well as attract juniors away from the information technology revolution such as computer games and the \"hip-hop\" culture.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Baseball NT', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7692683'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'pQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7692961', 'text': 'Nazareth Baptist Church\\n\\nThe Nazareth Baptist Church (Alternatively called \"The Nazarite Church\" \"iBandla lamaNazaretha\") is the second largest, (first and largest being Zion Christian Church with a membership of between 8 to 10 million), African initiated church founded by Isaiah Shembe in 1910.\\n\\nIt has approximately 3.2 million members.

She is known for her role as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the CBS sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" (1978â1982), which earned her three Golden Globe Award and two Emmy Award nominations.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nAnderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of Maxine Hazel (nÃ©e Kallin; 1924â1985), a model, and Klaydon Carl \"Andy\" Anderson (1922â1977), an environmental chemist. She grew up in suburban Roseville, Minnesota. As a senior at Alexander Ramsey Senior High School in Roseville, she was voted Valentine Queen of the Valentine\\'s Day Winter Formal of 1963. She attended the University of Minnesota. As she says in her autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels\", her father was originally going to name her \"Leiloni\" but then realized to his horror that when she got to her teen years it was likely to be twisted into \"Lay Loni\". So it was changed to simply \"Loni\".\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nHer acting debut came with a bit part in the film \"Nevada Smith\" (1966), starring Steve McQueen. After that, she went virtually unemployed as an actress for nearly a decade, before she finally began achieving guest roles on episodic television series in the mid-1970s. She appeared in two episodes of \"S.W.A.T.\", and later appeared on the sitcom \"Phyllis\", as well as the detective series \"Police Woman\" and \"Harry O\". In 1978, she guest-starred as Susan Walters on a season two episode of the popular sitcom \"Three\\'s Company\", after auditioning well but not winning the role of Chrissy at the start of the series. Her appearance on the show brought her to the attention of the ABC network.\\n\\nAnderson\\'s most famous acting role came as the sultry receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" (1978â1982). She was offered the role when producers saw the poster of her in a red swimsuitâa pose similar to Farrah Fawcett\\'s famous 1976 pin-up. The sitcom\\'s creator, Hugh Wilson, later admitted Anderson got the role because her body resembled Jayne Mansfield and because she possessed the innocent sexuality of Marilyn Monroe.\\n\\nAlthough the series suffered in the Nielsen ratings throughout the majority of its four-year run, it had a strong and loyal following among teenagers, young adults and disc jockeys. Owing to her rising popularity as the series\\' so-called \"main attraction\", Anderson walked out on the sitcom during the 1980 summer hiatus, requesting a substantial salary increase. During her hiatus, while she was renegotiating her contract, she starred as blonde bombshell Jayne Mansfield in the CBS made-for-television film \"The Jayne Mansfield Story\" (1980). After the network agreed to her requests, Anderson returned to the series and remained with it until its cancellation in 1982. The series has since remained popular in syndication around the world.\\n\\nAside from her acting career, Anderson has become known for her colorful personal life, particularly her relationship and marriage to actor Burt Reynolds.\\nThey starred in the comedy film \"Stroker Ace\" (1983), which was a critical and box office failure. She later appeared as herself in the romantic comedy \"The Lonely Guy\" (1984), starring Steve Martin. She voiced Flo, a collie in the animated classic film \"All Dogs Go to Heaven\" (1989).\\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, Anderson\\'s acting career gradually declined. She was teamed with \"Wonder Woman\" actress Lynda Carter in the television series, \"Partners in Crime\" in 1984. She appeared in television adaptations of classic Hollywood films, such as \"A Letter to Three Wives\" (1985) with Michele Lee, and \"Sorry, Wrong Number\" (1989) with Patrick Macnee and Hal Holbrook, both of which received little attention. After starring in \"Coins in the Fountain\" (1990), Anderson received considerable praise for her portrayal of comedian actress Thelma Todd in the television movie \"\" (1991). In the early 1990s, she attempted to co-star with her husband Burt Reynolds on his new CBS sitcom \"Evening Shade\", but the network was not fond of the idea, thus replacing Anderson with Marilu Henner. After Delta Burke was fired from the CBS sitcom \"Designing Women\" in 1991, producers offered Anderson a role as Burke\\'s replacement, which never came to pass because the network refused to pay Anderson the salary she had requested. She agreed to return as Jennifer Marlowe on two episodes of \"The New WKRP in Cincinnati\", a sequel to the original series. In 1993, Anderson was added to the third season of the NBC sitcom \"Nurses\", playing hospital administrator Casey MacAffee. Although her entering the series was an attempt to boost the series\\' ratings, the series was canceled shortly thereafter. Anderson has since returned to guest-starring on several popular television series, such as playing the \"witch-trash\" cousin on \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" and as Vallery Irons\\' mother on \"V.I.P.\" She also starred in the comedy film \"A Night at the Roxbury\" (1998).\\n\\nIn April 2018, Anderson was seen promoting the \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" television series and other classic television series on the MeTV television network.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nAnderson has been married four times; her first three marriages were to: Bruce Hasselberg (1964â1966), Ross Bickell (1973â1981), and actor (and \"Stroker Ace\" (1983) co-star) Burt Reynolds (1988â1993). On May 17, 2008, Anderson married musician Bob Flick, one of the founding members of the folk band The Brothers Four. The couple had first met at a movie premiere in Minneapolis in 1963.\\n\\nAnderson has two children: a daughter, Deidre Hoffman (fathered by Hasselberg), who was a school administrator in California; and a son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds (born August 31, 1988), whom she and Reynolds adopted. She also has a sister named Andrea Sams. Anderson\\'s autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels\", was published in 1997.\\n\\nGrowing up with parents of the World War II generation, who both smoked, Anderson witnessed the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease often caused by smoking. In 1999, she became a spokesperson about COPD.

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).\\n\\nThere are many variants of trawling gear. They vary according to local traditions, bottom conditions, and how large and powerful the trawling boats are. A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30\\xa0horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000\\xa0horsepower. Trawl variants include beam trawls, large-opening midwater trawls, and large bottom trawls, such as \"rock hoppers\" that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nDuring the 17th century, the British developed the Dogger, an early type of sailing trawler commonly operated in the North Sea. The Dogger takes its name from the Dutch word \"dogger\", meaning a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.\\n\\nThe modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of \\'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries\\'.\\n\\nThis revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean. The small village of Grimsby grew to become the \\'largest fishing port in the world\\' by the mid 19th century. With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the Grimsby Dock Company was opened in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time â the dock gates and cranes were operated by hydraulic power, and the Grimsby Dock Tower was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by William Armstrong.\\n\\nThe elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.\\n\\nSection::::Advent of steam power.\\nThe earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40â50 tons and travelled at .\\n\\nThe earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was \"Pioneer LH854\". She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being \"Degrave\" in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies.\\n\\nThe first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.\\n\\nSteam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch.\\n\\nSteam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.\\n\\nSection::::Further development.\\nTrawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II.\\n\\nThe first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus \"Algerine\"-class minesweeper (HMS \"Felicity\") with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.\\n\\nThe first purpose built stern trawler was \"Fairtry\" built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the \\'super trawler\\'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. \"Lord Nelson\" followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of \\'super trawlers\\' around the world in the following decades.\\n\\nSince World War II, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as radio navigation aids and fish finders. During the Cold War, some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as spy ships to monitor the activities of other countries.\\n\\nSection::::Modern trawlers.\\nModern trawlers are usually decked vessels designed for robustness. Their superstructure (wheelhouse and accommodation) can be forward, midship or aft. Motorised winches, electronic navigation and sonar systems are usually installed. Fishing equipment varies in sophistication depending on the size of the vessel and the technology used. Design features for modern fishing trawlers vary substantially, as many national maritime jurisdictions do not impose compulsory vessel inspection standards for smaller commercial fishing vessels.\\n\\nSection::::Mechanised hauling.\\nMechanised hauling devices are used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson winches, net drums and other auxiliary winches are installed on deck to control the towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.\\n\\nSection::::Electronics.\\nModern trawlers make extensive use of contemporary electronics, including navigation and communication equipment, fish detection devices, and equipment to control and monitor gear. Just which equipment will be installed depends on the size and type of the trawler.\\n\\nMuch of this equipment can be controlled from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper\\'s chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.\\n\\nNavigational instruments, such as an autopilot and GPS, are used for manoeuvering the vessel in harbour and at sea. Radar can be used, for example, when pair trawling to keep the correct distance between the two vessels. Communication instruments range from basic radio devices to maritime distress systems and EPIRBs, as well as devices for communicating with the crew. Fish detection devices, such as echosounders and sonar, are used to locate fish.\\nDuring trawling operations, a range of trawl sensors may be used to assist with controlling and monitoring gear. These are often referred to as \"trawl monitoring systems\" or \"net mensuration systems\".\\n\\nSection::::Fish storage and processing.\\nModern trawlers store the fish they catch in some form of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, the more likely it is to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.\\nSection::::Other design features.\\nCrew quarters are usually below the wheelhouse and may include bunks, with cot sides to stop the occupant from rolling out in heavy weather. The need for drying sea clothes is shown by a notice in at least one steam trawler\\'s boiler room saying \"\"Do not dry oil frocks over the boiler\"\".\\nSection::::Trawler types.\\nTrawlers can be classified by their architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The classification used below follows the FAO, who classify trawlers by the gear they use.\\n\\nSection::::Outrigger trawlers.\\nOutrigger trawlers use outriggers, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers are usually fastened to, or at the foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.\\n\\nOutrigger trawlers use vertical fish finders of different kinds, according to their size. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Beam trawlers.\\nBeam trawlers are a type of outrigger trawler (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks at the end of the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.\\n\\nBeam trawling is used in the flatfish fisheries in the North Sea. They are equipped with equipment for hauling the net and stowing it aboard. Typically an echosounder and sonar is used for finding fish.\\n\\nThey are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Otter trawlers.\\nOtter trawlers deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using otter boards. These trawls can be towed in midwater or along the bottom. Otter trawlers range in size from sailing canoes to supertrawlers.\\n\\nOtter trawlers usually have two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated by its own winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.\\n\\nUsually otter trawlers have the superstructure forward, though it can be aft or amidship. Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a stern gantry for operating the otter boards. Pelagic trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the cod end.\\n\\nSection::::Pair trawlers.\\nPair trawlers are trawlers which operate together towing a single trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair trawlers operate both midwater and bottom trawls.\\n\\nThe superstructure is forward or midships and the working deck aft. Pelagic trawlers can have fish pumps to empty the codend.\\n\\nSection::::Side trawlers.\\nSide trawlers have the trawl deployed over the side with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, \"Ross Tiger\" is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used for a longer period than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Stern trawlers.\\nStern trawlers have trawls which are deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers often have a ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nAny fish processing usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores the fish in ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.\\n\\nSection::::Freezer trawlers.\\nThe majority of trawlers operating on the high seas are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or side trawlers. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Wet fish trawlers.\\nWet fish trawlers are trawlers where the fish is kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition, in boxes covered with ice or with ice in the fish hold. They must operate in areas close to their landing place, and the time such a vessel can spend fishing is limited. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Trawler/purse seiners.\\nTrawler/purse seiners are designed so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged and used for both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the pursing lines and warp leads and in such a way as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.\\n\\nSection::::Naval trawlers.\\nDuring both World Wars some countries created small warships by converting and arming existing trawlers or building new vessels to standard trawler designs. They were typically armed with a small naval gun and sometimes depth charges, and were used for patrolling, escorting other vessels and minesweeping.\\n\\nSection::::Safety.\\nOccupational safety is a concern on fishing trawlers. For example, a United States cooperative which operates a fleet of 24 bottom trawlers in Alaskan water reported 25 fatalities over the period 2001â2012. The risk of a fatal injury was 41 times higher than the average for workers in the United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Fishing trawler', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=769874'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7699478', 'text': 'Revilo\\n\\nRevilo (\"Oliver\" spelt backwards) is\\n\\n', 'title': 'Revilo', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699478'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7701614', 'text': \"Mackenzie River, Queensland\\n\\nMackenzie River is a locality in the Isaac Region, Queensland, Australia.

Baetica was bordered to the west by Lusitania, and to the northeast by Hispania Tarraconensis. Baetica remained one of the basic divisions of Hispania under the Visigoths down to 711. Baetica () was part of Al-Andalus under the Moors in the 8th century and approximately corresponds to modern Andalusia. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nBefore Romanization, the mountainous area that was to become Baetica was occupied by several settled Iberian tribal groups. Celtic influence was not as strong as it was in the Celtiberian north. According to the geographer Claudius Ptolemy, the indigenes were the powerful Turdetani, in the valley of the Guadalquivir in the west, bordering on Lusitania, and the partly Hellenized Turduli with their city Baelo, in the hinterland behind the coastal Phoenician trading colonies, whose Punic inhabitants Ptolemy termed the \"Bastuli\". Phoenician Gadira (Cadiz) was on an island against the coast of Hispania Baetica. Other important Iberians were the Bastetani, who occupied the AlmerÃ­a and mountainous Granada regions. Towards the southeast, Punic influence spread from the Carthaginian cities on the coast: New Carthage (Roman \"Cartago Nova,\" modern Cartagena), Abdera and Malaca (MÃ¡laga).\\n\\nSome of the Iberian cities retained their pre-Indo-European names in Baetica throughout the Roman era. Granada was called \"Eliberri\", \"Illiberis\" and \"Illiber\" by the Romans; in Basque, \"\"iri-berri\"\" or \"\"ili-berri\"\", still signifies \"new town\".\\n\\nThe south of the Iberian peninsula was agriculturally rich, providing for export of wine, olive oil and the fermented fish sauce called \"garum\" that were staples of the Mediterranean diet, and its products formed part of the western Mediterranean trade economy even before it submitted to Rome in 206 BC. After the defeat of Carthage in the Second Punic War, which found its \"casus belli\" on the coast of Baetica at Saguntum, Hispania was significantly Romanized in the course of the 2nd century BC, following the uprising initiated by the Turdetani in 197. The central and north-eastern Celtiberians soon followed suit. It took Cato the Elder, who became consul in 195 BC and was given the command of the whole peninsula to put down the rebellion in the northeast and the lower Ebro valley. He then marched southwards and put down a revolt by the Turdetani. Cato returned to Rome in 194, leaving two praetors in charge of the two Iberian provinces. In the late Roman Republic, Hispania remained divided like Gaul into a \"Nearer\" and a \"Farther\" province, as experienced marching overland from Gaul: \"Hispania Citerior\" (the Ebro region), and \"Ulterior\" (the Guadalquivir region). The battles in Hispania during the 1st century BC were largely confined to the north.\\n\\nIn the reorganization of the Empire in 14 BC, when Hispania was remade into the three Imperial provinces, Baetica was governed by a proconsul who had formerly been a praetor. Fortune smiled on rich Baetica, which was \"Baetica Felix,\" and a dynamic, upwardly-mobile social and economic middling stratum developed there, which absorbed freed slaves and far outnumbered the rich elite. The Senatorial province of Baetica became so secure that no Roman legion was required to be permanently stationed there. \"Legio VII Gemina\" was permanently stationed to the north, in Hispania Tarraconensis.\\nHispania Baetica was divided into four \"conventÅ«s\", which were territorial divisions like judicial circuits, where the chief men met together at major centers, at fixed times of year, under the eye of the proconsul, to oversee the administration of justice: the \"conventus Gaditanus\" (of Gades, or CÃ¡diz), \"Cordubensis\" (of Cordoba), \"Astigitanus\" (of Astigi, or Ãcija), and \"Hispalensis\" (of Hispalis, or Seville). As the towns became the permanent seats of standing courts during the later Empire, the \"conventÅ«s\" were superseded (Justinian\\'s Code, i.40.6) and the term \"conventus\" is lastly applied to certain bodies of Roman citizens living in a province, forming a sort of enfranchised corporation, and representing the Roman people in their district as a kind of gentry; and it was from among these that proconsuls generally took their assistants. So in spite of some social upsets, as when Septimius Severus put to death a number of leading Baetiansâ including women â the elite in Baetica remained a stable class for centuries.\\n\\nColumella, who wrote a twelve volume treatise on all aspects of Roman farming and knew viticulture, came from Baetica. The vast olive plantations of Baetica shipped olive oil from the coastal ports by sea to supply Roman legions in Germania. Amphoras from Baetica have been found everywhere in the Western Roman empire. It was to keep Roman legions supplied by sea routes that the Empire needed to control the distant coasts of Lusitania and the northern Atlantic coast of Hispania.\\n\\nBaetica was rich and utterly Romanized, facts that the Emperor Vespasian was rewarding when he granted the \"Ius latii\" that extended the rights pertaining to Roman citizenship (\"latinitas\") to the inhabitants of Hispania, an honor that secured the loyalty of the Baetian elite and its middle class. The Roman Emperor Trajan, the first emperor of provincial birth, came from Baetica, though of Italian stock, and his kinsman and successor Hadrian came from a family residing in Baetica, though Hadrian himself was born at Rome (which some say he made up). Baetia was Roman until the brief invasion of the Vandals and Alans passed through in the 5th century, followed by the more permanent kingdom of the Visigoths. The province formed part of the Exarchate of Africa and was joined to Mauretania Tingitana after Belisarius\\' reconquest of Africa. The Catholic bishops of Baetica, solidly backed by their local population, were able to convert the Arian Visigoth king Reccared and his nobles. In the 8th century the Islamic Berbers (\"Moors\") of North Africa established the Caliphate of Cordoba, conquering Baetica. The region was known to them as \"al-Andalus\".\\n\\nThe early 20th-century composer Manuel de Falla wrote a \"FantasÃ­a BÃ©tica\" for piano, using Andalusian melodies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hispania Baetica', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770608', 'cat_id': '770608', 'cat_title': 'Motorsport_in_Daytona_Beach,_Florida', 'cat_pages': '13', 'cat_subcats': '2', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '770736', 'text': 'Kristijonas Donelaitis\\n\\nKristijonas Donelaitis (; 1 January 1714 â 18 February 1780) was a Prussian Lithuanian poet and Lutheran pastor. He lived and worked in Lithuania Minor, a territory in the Kingdom of Prussia, that had a sizable Lithuanian-speaking minority. He wrote the first classic Lithuanian language poem, \"The Seasons\" (), which became one of the principal works of Lithuanian poetry. The poem, a classic work of Lithuanian literature, depicts everyday life of Lithuanian peasants, their struggle with serfdom, and the annual cycle of life.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nDonelaitis was born at Lasdinehlen estate near Gumbinnen, East Prussia. His parents were free peasants who owned the land that they cultivated. His father died in 1720, leaving seven children (four sons and three daughters). One of his three brothers, Friedrich, became a goldsmith in KÃ¶nigsberg. Another brother, Michael, inherited the father\\'s farm. His third brother, Adam, became a blacksmith and innkeeper.\\n\\nIn 1731, Donelaitis began attending the cathedral school in Kneiphof, a section of KÃ¶nigsberg. He lived in a pauper\\'s dormitory and often went hungry for days. After graduation, he received a scholarship in 1736 to study at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg. For four years he studied Lutheran theology. His world view was shaped by the classical curriculum, required Lithuanian studies, and the Pietism movement. He learned Greek, Latin, French, and Hebrew languages, and studied the writings of classical authors such as Homer, Hesiod, Horace, and Virgil. After graduation, he was appointed as a cantor in StallupÃ¶nen. After the school rector died, Donelaitis took over his position. In 1743, he passed the required examination to become a pastor in Tollmingkehmen.\\n\\nSection::::Life in Tollmingkehmen.\\nDonelaitis lived in Tollmingkehmen from 1743 until his death in 1780. At the time, the parish of Tollmingkehmen had around 30 villages with around 3,000 residents. The population was about two-thirds German and one-third Lithuanian. In 1744, Donelaitis married Anna Regina Ohlefant, widow of the school rector in StallupÃ¶nen. In 1747, he worked to restore the rectory, and built a new brick church in 1756. In 1757, during the Seven Years\\' War, Donelaitis and his parishioners retreated to the Romincka Forest to hide from the advancing Imperial Russian Army. When he returned to the town, Donelaitis refused to preach praises to the Russian Tsar. After the war he rebuilt a burned school and sponsored construction of a shelter to widows. His hobbies included building thermometers and barometers, and constructing pianos and clavichords. He died, aged 66, in Tollmingkehmen, East Prussia.\\n\\nSection::::Works.\\nNone of Donelaitis\\'s works were published during his lifetime. Donelaitis wrote at least three poems in the German language (\"An der Amstrath Donalitius nach dem Verlust seiner Gattin\", \"Der Gott der Finsterniss\", and \"Unschuld sei mein ganzes Leben\"). His Lithuanian works consist of six fables and the poem \"The Seasons\". Donelaitis\\'s publisher, Ludwig Rhesa, believed that the fables, based on Aesop\\'s Fables, were written for his students in StallupÃ¶nen. Their language and poetic rhythm are not as well-developed as in his later works.\\n\\nHis major work, \"The Seasons\", was titled by Rheza. It consisted of four idylls, totaling 2,997 hexameters. The work was a long-term project, often revised and rewritten, without a clear beginning or ending. Only two original idylls survive. The other two were destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars. The full work is known from a copy made by Pastor Hohlfeldt after 1794. Between 1809 and 1818, Rheza collected Donelaitis\\'s works, edited and translated them, and finally published it as \"Das jahr in vier GesÃ¤ngen\". It was a heavily edited and censored edition, containing only about one sixth of the original poem. In 1824, Rheza also published the fables. A fuller publication of \"The Seasons\" was prepared by August Schleicher in 1865, but this edition was criticized by Georg H. F. Nesselmann, who prepared an edition in 1869.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nDonelaitis and his works are considered to be an important part of Lithuanian culture, which also led to creation of literature and music works based on Donelaitis\\'s life and his poem \"The Seasons\". In Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in 1985, an opera \"Kristijonas\" by Algimantas BraÅ¾inskas was performed. In 2012, an oratorio \"Seasons\" by Bronius KutaviÄius was performed.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kristijonas Donelaitis', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770736', 'cat_id': '770736', 'cat_title': \"USC_Trojans_men's_volleyball_players\", 'cat_pages': '9', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7710191', 'text': 'French ship Droits de l\\'Homme (1794)\\n\\nDroits de l\\'Homme () was a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars.

After unsuccessful attempts to land troops on Ireland, the \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" headed back to her home port of Brest with the soldiers still on board. Two British frigates were waiting to intercept stragglers from the fleet, and engaged \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" in the Action of 13 January 1797. Heavily damaged by the British ships and unable to manoeuvre in rough seas, the ship struck a sandbar and was wrecked. Hundreds of lives were lost in the disaster.\\n\\nSection::::Construction and naming.\\nThe ship was built at Port-LibertÃ© (now Lorient) and launched on \"10 Prairial de l\\'An II\" (29 May 1794).

On their way, the fleet was dispersed by tempests. The \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" arrived at Bantry Bay and cruised off the coast, capturing the brigs \"Cumberland\" and \"Calypso\". She stayed there for eight days to ascertain that no French ship was in distress on the coast, and departed for Brittany.\\nOn \"25 NivÃ´se An V\" in the Action of 13 January 1797, off Penmarch, \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" met the British frigates (44), under Sir Edward Pellew, and (36), commanded by Robert C. Reynolds. The sea was rough, preventing \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" from using her lower deck batteries and from boarding the British. Lacrosse was wounded; he gave command of the ship to his second officer, PrÃ©vost de Lacroix, and had his crew swear not to strike their colours.\\n\\nAfter 13 hours of combat, running out of ammunition, the British broke contact when \"Indefatigable\" sighted land ahead. \"Indefatigable\", despite having damage to her masts and rigging, managed to beat off the lee shore and escape Penmarch reefs; \"Amazon\" ran aground and was destroyed near PlozÃ©vet, and her crew captured. \"Droits de l\\'Homme\", having lost her rudder, masts and anchors, ran aground off PlozÃ©vet.\\n\\nSome of the crew were rescued by the ship\\'s boats and fishing boats from nearby villages, but the rescue was interrupted for five days by the storm; 60 men died for lack of food and water.

All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product. Package engineering is an interdisciplinary field integrating science, engineering, technology and management to protect and identify products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. It encompasses the process of design, evaluation, and production of packages. It is a system integral to the value chain that impacts product quality, user satisfaction, distribution efficiencies, and safety. includes industry-specific aspects of industrial engineering, marketing, materials science, industrial design and logistics. Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on. The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.\\n\\nEngineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials. Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes (sometimes resembling origami). Packaging involves extrusion, thermoforming, molding and other processing technologies. Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment. Packaging engineers use principles of structural analysis and thermal analysis in their evaluations.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nSome packaging engineers have backgrounds in other science, engineering, or design disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field.\\n\\nFormal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc. BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available. Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry-specific topics such as shelf life stability, corrugated box design, cushioning, engineering design, labeling regulations, project management, food safety, robotics, RFID tags, quality management, package testing, packaging machinery, tamper-evident methods, recycling, computer-aided design, etc.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Packaging engineering', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710805'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'sQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7712095', 'text': 'Information Technology Act, 2000\\n\\nThe Information Technology Act, 2000 (also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act) is an Act of the Indian Parliament (No 21 of 2000) notified on 17 October 2000. It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce. It is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration recommended by the General Assembly of United Nations by a resolution dated 30 January 1997.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nThe bill was passed in the budget session of 2000 and signed by President K. R. Narayanan on 9 May 2000. The bill was finalised by group of officials headed by then Minister of Information Technology Pramod Mahajan.\\n\\nSection::::Summary.\\nThe original Act contained 94 sections, divided into 13 chapters and 4 schedules. The laws apply to the whole of India. Persons of other nationalities can also be indicted under the law, if the crime involves a computer or network located in India.\\n\\nThe Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures. It also defines cyber crimes and prescribes penalties for them. The Act directed the formation of a Controller of Certifying Authorities to regulate the issuance of digital signatures. It also established a Cyber Appellate Tribunal to resolve disputes rising from this new law. The Act also amended various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Banker\\'s Book Evidence Act, 1891, and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to make them compliant with new technologies.\\n\\nSection::::Amendments.\\nA major amendment was made in 2008. It introduced Section 66A which penalized sending of \"offensive messages\". It also introduced Section 69, which gave authorities the power of \"interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource\". It also introduced provisions addressing child porn, cyber terrorism and voyeurism. The amendment was passed on 22 December 2008 without any debate in Lok Sabha. The next day it was passed by the Rajya Sabha. It was signed into law by President Pratibha Patil, on 5 February 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Offences.\\nList of offences and the corresponding penalties:\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Criticisms.\\nSection::::Section 66A and restriction of free speech.\\nFrom its establishment as an amendment to the original act in 2008, Section 66A attracted controversy over its unconstitutional nature:\\n\\nIn December 2012, P Rajeev, a Rajya Sabha member from Kerala, tried to pass a resolution seeking to amend the Section 66A. He was supported by D. Bandyopadhyay, Gyan Prakash Pilania, Basavaraj Patil Sedam, Narendra Kumar Kashyap, Rama Chandra Khuntia and Baishnab Charan Parida. P Rajeev pointed that cartoons and editorials allowed in traditional media, were being censored in the new media. He also said that law was barely debated before being passed in December 2008.\\n\\nRajeev Chandrasekhar suggested the 66A should only apply to person to person communication pointing to a similar section under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. Shantaram Naik opposed any changes, saying that the misuse of law was sufficient to warrant changes. Then Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal defended the existing law, saying that similar laws existed in US and UK. He also said that a similar provision existed under Indian Post Office Act, 1898. However, P Rajeev said that the UK dealt only with communication from person to person.\\n\\nSection::::Petitions challenging constitutionality.\\nIn November 2012, IPS officer Amitabh Thakur and his wife social activist Nutan Thakur, filed a petition in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court claiming that the Section 66A violated the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. They said that the section was vague and frequently misused.\\n\\nAlso in November 2012, a Delhi-based law student, Shreya Singhal, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court of India. She argued that the Section 66A was vaguely phrased, as result it violated Article 14, 19 (1)(a) and Article 21 of the Constitution. The PIL was accepted on 29 November 2012. A similar petition was also filed by the founder of MouthShut.com, Faisal Farooqui, and NGO Common Cause represented by Prashant Bhushan\\nIn August 2014, the Supreme Court asked the central government to respond to petitions filed by Mouthshut.com and later petition filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) which claimed that the IT Act gave the government power to arbitrarily remove user-generated content.\\n\\nSection::::Revocation by the Supreme Court.\\nOn 24 March 2015, the Supreme Court of India, gave the verdict that Section 66A is unconstitutional in entirety. The court said that Section 66A of IT Act 2000 is \"arbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately invades the right of free speech\" provided under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. But the Court turned down a plea to strike down sections 69A and 79 of the Act, which deal with the procedure and safeguards for blocking certain websites. \\n\\nSection::::Strict data privacy rules.\\nThe data privacy rules introduced in the Act in 2011 have been described as too strict by some Indian and US firms. The rules require firms to obtain written permission from customers before collecting and using their personal data. This has affected US firms which outsource to Indian companies. However, some companies have welcomed the strict rules, saying it will remove fears of outsourcing to Indian companies.\\n\\nSection::::Section 69 and mandatory decryption.\\nThe Section 69 allows intercepting any information and ask for information decryption. To refuse decryption is an offence. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 allows the government to tap phones. But, according to a 1996 Supreme Court verdict the government can tap phones only in case of a \"public emergency\". But, there is no such restriction on Section 69. On 20 December 2018, the Ministry of Home Affairs cited Section 69 in the issue of an order authorising ten central agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt âany information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.â While some claim this to be a violation of the fundamental right to privacy, the Ministry of Home Affairs has claimed its validity on the grounds of national security. \\n\\nSection::::Future changes.\\nOn 2 April 2015, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis revealed to the state assembly that a new law was being framed to replace the repealed Section 66A. Fadnavis was replying to a query Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe. Gorhe had said that repeal of the law would encourage online miscreants and asked whether the state government would frame a law to this regard. Fadnavis said that the previous law had resulted in no convictions, so the law would be framed such that it would be strong and result in convictions.\\n\\nOn 13 April 2015, it announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs would form a committee of officials from the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Delhi Police and ministry itself to produce a new legal framework. This step was reportedly taken after complaints from intelligence agencies that, they were no longer able to counter online posts that involved national security matter or incite people to commit an offence, such as online recruitment for ISIS. Former Minister of State with the Ministry of Information Technology, Milind Deora has supported a new \"unambiguous section to replace 66A\".\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Information Technology Act, 2000', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712095'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'sgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7715205', 'text': '2005 Azores subtropical storm\\n\\nThe 2005 Azores subtropical storm was the 19th nameable storm and only subtropical storm of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was not officially named by the US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October\\xa04. The storm was short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on October\\xa04 before becoming extratropical again on October\\xa05. Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time. After being absorbed into a cold front, the system went on to become Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula.\\n\\nMonths after the hurricane season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review of the season and its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a well-defined centre convecting around a warm coreâthe hallmark of a subtropical storm.\\n\\nSection::::Meteorological history.\\nThe system originated out of an upper-level low just west of the Canary Islands on September\\xa028. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October\\xa03, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460\\xa0mi, 740\\xa0km) southwest of SÃ£o Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October\\xa04, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.\\n\\nAround the same time, the depression turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50\\xa0mph (85\\xa0km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October\\xa05 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October\\xa08.\\n\\nAt the time, the system was not believed to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that the system was indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.\\n\\nSection::::Impact, classification, and records.\\nTropical storm-force winds were reported across parts of the Azores, primarily on the eastern islands. The strongest winds were reported on Santa Maria Island, where 10-minute sustained winds reached 49\\xa0mph (79\\xa0km/h) with gusts to 59\\xa0mph (94\\xa0km/h). Ponta Delgada faced 38\\xa0mph (61\\xa0km/h) winds, with the peak recorded gust being 52\\xa0mph (85\\xa0km/h). No damage or fatalities were reported.\\n\\nThe storm was not classified as a subtropical storm until April\\xa010, 2006, after a reassessment by the National Hurricane Center. Every year, the NHC re-analyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history frequently if there is new data that was operationally unavailable. If the storm had been operationally recognized, it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October\\xa04 would have been moved one name down the list. Hurricane Wilma would have been given the name \"Alpha\": a name that, had it been retired like Wilma was, could not be replaced by an \"alternate\" Greek letter, as is the convention with names on the standard AâW list. When the system strengthened into a subtropical storm on October\\xa04, it was the earliest the 19th tropical or subtropical storm of the season formed. The old record was held by an unnamed storm in the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on October\\xa025, 1933. It was also only the fourth time that 19\\xa0storms formed in a season.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': '2005 Azores subtropical storm', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715205'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'swE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7717712', 'text': 'FranÃ§ois-Romain LhÃ©risson\\n\\nLe grandHaitiFranÃ§ois-Romain LhÃ©risson (1798â1859) was a Haitian poet and educator.

The ninth through sixteenth levels are identical to the first through eighth, except the cars all move faster and the dollar signs (see next paragraph) don\\'t last as long.

Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations, this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container, such as an upside down pint glass. Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the Backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact.\\n\\nThe procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect. The alcohols listed can be substituted with others, as there are various recipes. However, the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink.\\n\\nSection::::Classical Backdraft Preparation.\\nA classic Backdraft is prepared by pouring equal amounts of Drambuie and Grand Marnier into a snifter. The mixture is set alight, and after a few seconds, extinguished by having the imbiber seal the top of the glass with their hand, although often a coaster or saucer is used instead. Once the flame is out, a straw is inserted, keeping as much of the seal intact as possible to contain the vapors.\\n\\nBoth the liquid and the vapors are then consumed through the straw.\\n\\nDrambuie and Grand Marnier will be extremely difficult to ignite, if not impossible, so backdrafts are commonly done with 1 part Grand Marnier and 1 part 151.\\n\\nSection::::Alternate \"Shooter\" Backdraft preparation.\\nThe procedure is as follows:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Backdraft physics.\\nWhen a gas is heated, its volume increases. It will displace cooler gases as it expands. If this is done in a partially enclosed space, and the vessel allowed to be full of hot gas, when the heat is taken away, the gases cool and as they do, the amount of liquids that the gas can hold will decrease. Therefore, most of the moisture and alcohol held in the gas will condense. As the gas cools, it decreases in volume, and the pressure drops. Thus when the flaming alcohol in a backdraft is covered with a pint glass over a saucer, the dense, cold air is replaced with less dense, warm air with a lot of alcohol vapour held in it. As the oxygen flow to the fire is restricted, the remaining oxygen is used up and the fire in the pint glass goes out, removing the heat source. The alcohol-laden warm air now in the glass cools and begins to create a pressure difference. The air outside the pint glass forces its way into the partially evacuated pint glass and is responsible for pushing any liquid at the outside bottom of the pint glass further inside (as the seal of the glass and the saucer is not perfect) as it begins to equalise the pressure difference. Once the majority of the liquid is inside the upside down pint glass, sometimes further air can be seen to bubble up into the glass. At some point an equilibrium will occur, where the pressure difference between inside and outside of the glass is equal to the pressure of the column of liquid held up inside, and this will hold the liquid inside the glass. Sometimes, when a good seal is made, the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the glass exerts a great enough force that when the glass is lifted, the saucer will remain stuck to its underside.\\n\\nWhen the pint glass is removed, ice is immediately added, thus causing the condensation of the alcohol vapour, creating a white mist in the glass by a process fairly similar to the formation of contrails. By covering the glass with the hand, this vapour is trapped until it is extracted by the process of inhalation, usually through a straw.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Backdraft (drink)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725386'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'uQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7725958', 'text': 'William G.

Set in farm country outside the town of Claremore, Indian Territory, in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancÃ©e, Ado Annie.\\n\\nThe original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943. It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an Academy Award-winning 1955 film adaptation. It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions. Rodgers and Hammerstein won a special Pulitzer Prize for \"Oklahoma!\" in 1944.\\n\\nThis musical, building on the innovations of the earlier \"Show Boat\", epitomized the development of the \"book musical\", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter. In addition, \"Oklahoma!\" features musical themes, or motifs, that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story. A fifteen-minute \"dream ballet\" reflects Laurey\\'s struggle with her feelings about two men, Curly and Jud.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nBy the early 1940s, Rodgers and Hammerstein were each well known for creating Broadway hits with other collaborators. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as \"Babes in Arms\" (1937), \"The Boys from Syracuse\" (1938) and \"Pal Joey\" (1940). Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for \"Rose-Marie\" (1924), \"The Desert Song\" (1926), \"The New Moon\" (1927) and \"Show Boat\" (1927). Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\", which was included in the 1941 film \"Lady Be Good\". By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.\\n\\nSection::::Conception.\\nIn 1931, the Theatre Guild produced Lynn Riggs\\'s \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", a play about settlers in Oklahoma\\'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, Theresa Helburn, one of the Guild\\'s producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional folk songs and square dances and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, whose first successful collaboration, \"The Garrick Gaieties\", had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925. Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart. Rodgers had asked Oscar Hammerstein II to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart\\'s \"By Jupiter\" in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place. Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", but when he had approached Jerome Kern about it, the latter declined. Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity. Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing. He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.\\n\\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers\\' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein\\'s previous collaborators included composers Rudolf Friml, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics. The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it. As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", not by musical comedy conventions. Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.\\n\\nSection::::Casting and development.\\nBetween the world wars, roles in musicals were usually filled by actors who could sing, but Rodgers and Hammerstein chose, conversely, to cast singers who could act. Though Theresa Helburn, codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested Shirley Temple as Laurey and Groucho Marx as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director Rouben Mamoulian\\'s support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast. As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step. The production was choreographed by Agnes de Mille (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show\\'s most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the dream ballet) depicting Laurey\\'s struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.\\n\\nThe first title given to the work was \"Away We Go!\" which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in New Haven\\'s Shubert Theatre on March 11, 1943. Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power. Producer Mike Todd walked out after the first act during the tryout and wisecracked, \"No legs, no jokes, no chance.\" But Rodgers and Hammerstein were confident. The New Haven and Boston audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping musical number, \"Oklahoma\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.\\n\\nTodd had been wrong; the show opened on Broadway to raves from the critics, sold out, and won a special Pulitzer Prize. Brooks Atkinson wrote in \"The New York Times\" that the show\\'s opening number, \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin\\'\" changed the history of musical theater: \"After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.\" The \"New York Post\" was the only major paper to give \"Oklahoma!\" a mixed review. Its critic felt that while the songs were pleasant enough, they sounded much alike. The show\\'s creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein\\'s contemporaries and ushered in the \"Golden Age\" of American musical theatre.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nSection::::Act I.\\nIn Oklahoma territory in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to the beautiful day ahead as he wanders into farm girl Laurey Williams\\'s yard (\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin\\'\"). He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat the lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long. He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\\n\\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance. She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud. Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern Kansas City (\"Kansas City\"). He won $50 at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie\\'s father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie. Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie\\'s father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a Persian peddler. Laurey tells her she\\'ll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"I Cain\\'t Say No\"). Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey). Laurey tells her friends that she doesn\\'t really care about Curly (\"Many a New Day\").\\n\\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim. After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her. Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"It\\'s a Scandal! It\\'s a Outrage!\"). Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead. Afraid to tell Jud she won\\'t go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"People Will Say We\\'re in Love\"). Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him. Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\"). Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud\\'s resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"Lonely Room\").\\n\\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as smelling salts, but actually laudanum) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love. She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like. Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires. The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\\n\\nSection::::Act II.\\nAt the social, during an upbeat square dance (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will\\'s souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will\\'s Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie\\'s basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her. Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey\\'s basket comes up for auction. Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey\\'s basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money. Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket. Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance. Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"All Er Nuthin\\'\").\\n\\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her. When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her. She then fires him as her farm hand, screaming at him to get off her property. Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly. She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now. Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We\\'re In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterwards, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\\n\\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory\\'s impending statehood (\"Oklahoma\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being threatened by her father with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fist fight. Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife. Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller\\'s urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \"not guilty!\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the surrey with the fringe on top (\"Finale Ultimo\").\\n\\nSection::::Principal roles and notable performers.\\nÂ° denotes original Broadway cast\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production history.\\nSection::::Original Broadway.\\nThe original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943 at the St. James Theatre in New York City. It was directed by Rouben Mamoulian and choreographed by Agnes de Mille. It starred Alfred Drake (Curly), Joan Roberts (Laurey), Celeste Holm (Ado Annie), Howard Da Silva (Jud Fry), Betty Garde (Aunt Eller), Lee Dixon (Will Parker), Joseph Buloff (Ali Hakim), Jane Lawrence (Gertie), Barry Kelley (Ike) and George S. Irving (Joe). Marc Platt danced the role of \"Dream Curly\", Katharine Sergava danced the part of \"Dream Laurey\" and the small dancing part of Aggie was played by Bambi Linn. George Church danced the part of \"Dream Jud\" but was replaced by Vladimir Kostenko only two months after the premiere.\\n\\nThe production ran for 2,212 performances, finally closing on May 29, 1948. \"The demand for tickets was unprecedented as the show became more popular in the months that followed\" the opening. \"Oklahoma!\" ran for over five years, a Broadway record that \"would not be bested until \"My Fair Lady\" (1956).\" The Tony Awards and other awards now given for achievement in musical theatre were not in existence in 1943, and therefore the original production of \"Oklahoma!\" received no theatrical awards.\\n\\nSection::::Early U.S. tours.\\nThe \"first of several\" national tours began in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1944. A 1953 article in \"The New York Times\" reported that the show was \"believed to be the only musical to have enjoyed a consecutive run of ten years. It ran on Broadway for five years and two months, grossing $7,000,000. The tour of the national company, which started late in 1943, has grossed $15,000,000.\" John Raitt played Curly in the original production in Chicago. The United Service Organizations sponsored a tour to U.S. military bases in 1945 that lasted for several years. \"The New York Times\" reported in 1953: \\n\\nSection::::Original West End.\\n\"Oklahoma!\" was the first of a post-war wave of Broadway musicals to reach London\\'s West End. It starred Howard Keel (then known as Harold Keel) and Betty Jane Watson, opening at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on April 30, 1947 to rave press reviews and sellout houses, running for 1,543 performances. A pre-London run opened a day late at the Manchester Opera House on April 18, 1947, after the ship carrying the cast, scenery, and costumes ran aground on a sandbank off Southampton.\\n\\nSection::::1951 and 1979 Broadway revivals.\\nA 1951 revival produced by the Theatre Guild opened at The Broadway Theatre on May 9, 1951, and ran for 100 performances. Ridge Bond played Curly, Patricia Northrop played Laurey, Henry Clarke was Jud, and Jacqueline Sundt played Ado Annie. Mamoulian and de Mille returned to direct and choreograph, and the production was restaged by Jerome Whyte. In 1953, a 10th anniversary revival opened on August 31 at the New York City Center Theatre. It ran for a limited engagement of 40 performances before going on tour. The cast included Florence Henderson as Laurey, Ridge Bond as Curly and Barbara Cook as Annie. Mamoulian and De Mille directed and choreographed.\\n\\nA 1979 revival opened at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on December 13, 1979 and closed on August 24, 1980, running for 293 performances and nine previews. William Hammerstein (Oscar\\'s son) directed, and Gemze de Lappe recreated Agnes De Mille\\'s choreography. The show starred Christine Andreas as Laurey, Laurence Guittard as Curly, Mary Wickes as Aunt Eller, Christine Ebersole as Ado Annie, Martin Vidnovic as Jud Fry, Harry Groener as Will Parker and Bruce Adler as Ali Hakim. Andreas and Groener both received Tony Award nominations for their performances, and Vidnovic won a Drama Desk Award. This production started as a cross-country national tour, beginning at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles on May 1, 1979.\\n\\nSection::::1980 and 1998 West End revivals.\\nThe following year, James Hammerstein directed a production at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, in January 1980, produced by Cameron Mackintosh. The De Mille choreography was again adapted by de Lappe. A UK tour followed, and it eventually settled in the West End, opening at the Palace Theatre, London, on September 17, 1980, and running until September 19, 1981. This production starred John Diedrich as Curly and Alfred Molina as Jud Fry, both of whom were nominated for Olivier Awards. Rosamund Shelley played Laurey, and Madge Ryan was Aunt Eller. The production was Maria Friedman\\'s debut in the West End, initially in the chorus role of Doris, but she was eventually promoted to the leading role. John Owen Edwards was the musical director. He would later reprise his work for Mackintosh\\'s 1998 London revival. A cast recording of this production was issued by JAY Records and on the \"Showtime!\" label.\\nA dark-themed production of the musical was presented by the National Theatre in London at the Olivier Theatre, opening on July 15, 1998. The production team included Trevor Nunn (director), Susan Stroman (choreographer) and William David Brohn (orchestrator). The international cast included Hugh Jackman as Curly, Maureen Lipman as Aunt Eller, Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey, Shuler Hensley as Jud Fry, Vicki Simon as Ado Annie, Peter Polycarpou as Ali Hakim and Jimmy Johnston as Will Parker. Musical director John Owen Edwards, Brohn and dance arranger David Krane adapted Robert Russell Bennett\\'s original orchestrations and extended some of the dance sequences. A new Dream Ballet was composed for Susan Stroman\\'s new choreography, and the dances to \"Kansas City\", \"Many a New Day\" and \"The Farmer and the Cowman\" were all redesigned. The overture was also altered, at the request of Nunn.\\n\\nThe production received numerous Olivier Award nominations, winning for Outstanding Musical Production, supporting actor (Hensley), set design (Anthony Ward) and choreography (Stroman). According to the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, the limited engagement was a sell-out and broke all previous box office records, and so the show was transferred to the Lyceum Theatre in the West End for a six-month run. Plans to transfer to Broadway with the London cast were thwarted by Actors\\' Equity, which insisted that American actors must be cast. Eventually a U.S. cast was selected. The production was filmed and issued on DVD, as well as being broadcast on U.S. Public Television in November 2003.\\n\\nSection::::2002 Broadway revival.\\nThe London production was repeated on Broadway at the George Gershwin Theatre on March 21, 2002, with direction by Nunn. The production closed on February 23, 2003 after 388 performances. Only two of the London cast, Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey and Shuler Hensley as Jud, were in the production, which also featured Patrick Wilson as Curly and Andrea Martin as Aunt Eller. It was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical and Best Featured Actor in a Musical (which was awarded to Hensley). The musical was also nominated for nine Drama Desk Awards, with Hensley winning as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical and Susan Stroman winning for choreography.\\n\\nBen Brantley wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"At its best, which is usually when it\\'s dancing, this resurrection of Rodgers and Hammerstein\\'s epochal show is dewy with an adolescent lustiness, both carnal and naive, exuberant and confused.\" The review stated that \"Anthony Ward\\'s harmoniously curved set, in which the sky seems to stretch into eternity, again pulses with the promise of a land on the verge of transformation.\" The \"New York Daily News\" review commented that \"Visually, this one is stunning â at times, Anthony Ward\\'s sets have a pastoral, idyllic quality, like Thomas Hart Benton\\'s paintings. At other times, especially in lighting designer David Hersey\\'s lustrous palette, they convey the bleakness of the frontier.\" The review also stated that the Royal National Theatre \"brought it back to us in a way that makes it seem fresh and vital.\" However, \"USA Today\" gave the production a tepid assessment, its reviewer writing that \"A cold breeze blows through this beautiful mornin\\', and that golden haze is never quite bright enough.\" The production went on to tour nationally from 2003â2005.\\n\\nSection::::2019 Broadway revival.\\nFollowing a 2015 workshop at Bard College and a 2018 run at Brooklyn\\'s St. Ann\\'s Warehouse, a 75th anniversary staging of \"Oklahoma!\" transferred to Broadway at Circle in the Square Theatre. The production is directed by Daniel Fish in an intimate, immersive style, set in a community hall, with chili and cornbread served to the audience at intermission. The production began preview performances on March 19, 2019 and officially opened on April 7 for a limited run through September 1. It stars Rebecca Naomi Jones as Laurey, Damon Daunno as Curley, Ali Stroker as Ado Annie, James Davis as Will Parker, Will Brill as Ali Hakim, Patrick Vaill as Jud and Mary Testa as Aunt Eller. The production features choreography by John Heginbotham and new music arrangements by Daniel Kluger, performed by a seven-piece band.\\n\\n\"Oklahoma!\" was presented nightly except Sundays each summer at the Discoveryland amphitheater, an outdoor theatre in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, from 1977 until 2011. In 1993, Mary Rodgers (daughter of Richard Rodgers) and William Hammerstein (son of Oscar Hammerstein II) designated Discoveryland the \"National Home of Rodgers and Hammerstein\\'s \"Oklahoma!\"\"\\n\\nIn 2006, \"Oklahoma!\" was performed in Japan by the all-female Takarazuka Revue. This revival starred Yuu Todoroki, Ai Shirosaki, and Hiromu Kiriya.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2009, British director John Doyle directed the musical at the Chichester Festival Theatre. The production was dark in concept and featured new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. On a spare stage, decorated only with blue sheets, \"Confetti of rose petals stains the floor like drops of blood, and a nightmarish dream-dance sequence has Freudian overtones as Laurey\\'s bridal gown becomes her shroud.\" It received mixed reviews. \"The Times\" reviewer wrote: \"This is a very stylised, overdrilled production, no friend of intimate moments or quiet depth of emotion.\" \"The Guardian\" liked it the most, stating that \"it\\'s a delight, with one brilliant tippy-tappy-toed song after another and a nugget of darkness lodged in its sweet heart.\" \"Whats On Stage\", like most of the papers, gave the show three out of five stars and wrote that this is a \"downbeat vision\" and that \"all told it\\'s a somewhat disappointing show\", but their \"average reader rating\" was four stars. A review in \"The Telegraph\" commented, \"Doyle uses shadow and silhouette to bring out the musical\\'s nightmarish aspects but doesn\\'t over-labour them. There are enough sunny spots â no more so than in Act 2\\'s rousing title song â to keep the tone evenly textured.\"\\n\\nThe show toured England for nine months in 2010 in a new staging by Julian Woolford, with Marti Webb as Aunt Eller and Mark Evans as Curly.\\n\\n\"Oklahoma!\" opened in October 2010 at the Arena Stage to critical acclaim. Artistic Director Molly Smith cast African-American actresses as Laurey and Aunt Eller to mirror both modern Washington, D.C. demographics and the diverse population of the musical\\'s 1906 Oklahoma territory setting. The production received ten 2011 Helen Hayes Award nominations, winning as Outstanding Resident Musical (tying with Shakespeare Theatre\\'s \"Candide\") and for choreography (Parker Esse), lead actor (Nicholas Rodriguez as Curly) and musical direction (George Fulginiti-Shakar). The production returned to the Arena Stage for a second run in 2011.\\n\\nThe 5th Avenue Theatre\\'s 2012 production, directed by Peter Rothstein, included African-American dancers and an African-American actor as Jud. The choice was intended, as in the Arena Stage production, to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory, but it \"has some audience members squirming in their seats ... they\\'re seeing on stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history: an imposing black man ravaging a petite white woman [and] the white hero ... all but urges Jud to hang himself â and even pantomimes the act. Some see a clear reference to lynching.\" The \"Dream Ballet\" had a sinister, sexual tone and ended with Jud dragging Laurey away to be raped. One critic noted the historical \"license taken when an African-American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance. ... Maybe some people ... left with not so much a song in their head, but a question in their heart. And isn\\'t that part of what theater is supposed to do?\" Another wrote: \"Rothstein\\'s \"Oklahoma!\" is now the story of a crazy, sex obsessed black man ... lusting violently after his white mistress, who ends up murdered at the hands of a white man, who gets off scot free after a mock trial.\"\\n\\nA UK tour ran from February to August 2015, directed by Rachel Kavanaugh and starring Ashley Day as Curly, Charlotte Wakefield as Laurey, Belinda Lang as Aunt Eller and Gary Wilmot as Ali Hakim.\\n\\nSection::::1955 film adaptation.\\nThe 1955 film adaptation starred Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones (in her film debut), Rod Steiger, Charlotte Greenwood, Gloria Grahame, Gene Nelson, James Whitmore and Eddie Albert. It was the only musical film directed by Fred Zinnemann, and Agnes de Mille choreographed. It was the first feature film photographed in the Todd-AO 70 mm widescreen process.\\n\\nRodgers and Hammerstein personally oversaw the film to prevent the studio from making the changes that were then typical of stage-to-film musical adaptations, such as interpolating new songs by others. The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs. For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City. Lyrics in the song about a burlesque stripteaser were slightly changed to pass film censorship. In a nod to \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife. The film omits only \"It\\'s a Scandal, It\\'s an Outrage\" and \"Lonely Room\". The film won Academy Awards for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound, Recording.\\nSection::::Recordings.\\nMost of the songs from \"Oklahoma!\" were released on a record album by Decca Records in 1943 containing six 10-inch double-sided discs in 78 RPM format. It was the first U.S. cast album featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical. It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as \"Oklahoma! Volume Two\". In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors\\' item. All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.\\n\\nThe success of the original \"Oklahoma!\" cast album set a precedent for the production of original cast recordings of Broadway musicals, which became an essential part of a musical\\'s dissemination and endurance in popular culture. Later cast recordings of \"Oklahoma!\" include the 1979 Broadway revival cast recording, the 1980 London revival cast recording, the 1998 Royal National Theatre revival cast recording, and a soundtrack album of the 1955 film. There have also been more than 20 studio cast recordings of the show, featuring stars such as Nelson Eddy, John Raitt and Florence Henderson in the leading roles.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nThe original production of \"Oklahoma!\" was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the \"New York Journal American\" pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers\\'s music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\". In the \"New York Herald Tribune\", Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\" Louis Kronenberger of \"PM\" opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein\\'s lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart\\'s at their best, but the songs in \"Oklahoma!\" call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"\\n\\nIn the \"New York Daily News\", Burns Mantle declared that \"\"Oklahoma!\" really is different â beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, \"Oklahoma!\" seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber\\'s \"Show Boat\"\". \"New York World-Telegram\" critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin\\'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ... They are spinetingling, out of this world.\" In \"The New York Sun\", Ward Morehouse commented that \"\"Oklahoma!\" is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night\\'s audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\" Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi\\'s restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"\\n\\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the \"New York Post\": The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers\\'s songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\" She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"\\n\\nSection::::Antecedents and influence.\\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is \\'Oklahoma!\\' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ... It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\" William Zinsser observed that \"Oklahoma!\" broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot. The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to \"Oklahoma!\"\" \"Oklahoma!\" made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".\\n\\nTheater historian Ethan Mordden points out that, although \"Oklahoma!\" has been called \"the first integrated musical, the first American folk musical\", \"Show Boat\" \"got there first on both counts.\" Even earlier, the Princess Theatre musicals, following Gilbert and Sullivan and French \"opÃ©ra bouffe\", began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals, paving the way for \"Show Boat\" and \"Oklahoma!\" by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. These Princess Theatre shows, which featured modern American settings, \"built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern\\'s exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.\" Mordden also notes that \"Oklahoma!\" was called the first great dance musical, but other musicals had earlier focused on dance, among them \"Gay Divorce\" and \"On Your Toes\". He concludes: \"But \"Oklahoma!\" was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"\\n\\nSection::::In popular culture.\\n\"Oklahoma!\" has frequently been quoted or parodied in films, television and other media.

It is the first regional natural gas transmission system in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nSection::::History.\\nThe project began in 1982, when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) proposed the development of a natural gas pipeline throughout West Africa. In 1991 a feasibility report conducted by the World Bank on supplying Nigerian gas on West African markets deemed that a project was commercially viable.\\n\\nIn September 1995, the governments of four African countries signed a Heads of State Agreement. The feasibility study was carried out in 1999. On 11 August 1999, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by participating countries in Cotonou, Benin. In February 2000, an Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed. The WAGP implementation agreement was signed in 2003. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana, on 3 December 2004. Construction began in 2005.\\n\\nThe offshore pipeline was completed in December 2006 and was scheduled to start operating on 23 December 2007 but was delayed after leaks were detected in supply pipelines in Nigeria. The second delivery deadline was scheduled on 13 February 2008, but regular deliveries were delayed again, when one of the contractors of Willbros was shot and killed in Nigeria by armed robbers.\\n\\nGas deliveries were expected by the end of 2009 after commissioning regulating and metering stations in Takoradi and Tema, Ghana, Lagos Beach, Nigeria, Cotonou, Benin, and LomÃ©, Togo in May 2008. However, deliveries were postponed again due to an irregular amount of moisture found inside the onshore gas pipeline.\\n\\nSection::::Route.\\nThe pipeline consists three sections with a total length of . The long offshore section starts at starts the Itoki terminal in southeastern Nigeria and runs through the waters of Benin, Togo and Ghana parallel to the coastline, approximately to offshore in water depths of between and . The Nigerian onshore section of the pipeline connects the offshore section compressor station at Lagos Beach with the Chevron-owned EscravosâLagos Pipeline System, operational since 1989. It is possible that later the WAGP will be extended to CÃ´te d'Ivoire and in longer term even to Senegal.\\n\\nSection::::Technical description.\\nThe diameter of the onshore section is . The diameter of the offshore pipeline is and the capacity is 5\\xa0billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per year. The pipeline was constructed by Willbros, with Bredero Shaw Ltd applying a concrete coating to the pipeline at its facility in Tema, Ghana. The pre-commissioning services were provided by BJ Process and Pipeline Services. The total pipeline costs around US$974\\xa0million, for which the World Bank provided a guarantee of $50\\xa0million for Ghana, while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provided a $75\\xa0million political risk guarantee for WAGPo as a whole.\\n\\nSection::::Project company.\\nThe pipeline is owned by West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAGPCo), a consortium of Chevron (36.7%), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (25%), Royal Dutch Shell (18%), Volta River Authority of Ghana (16.3%), SociÃ©tÃ© Togolaise de Gaz (SoToGaz - 2%) and SociÃ©tÃ© Beninoise de Gaz S.A.

Score pitched for the Cleveland Indians from 1955 through 1959 and the Chicago White Sox from 1960 through 1962. He was the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1955, and an AL All-Star in 1955 and 1956. Due to an on-field injury that occurred in 1957, he retired early as a player in 1962. Score was a television and radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians from 1964 through 1997. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nHerb Score was born in Rosedale, New York, in 1933. At 3, he was run over by a truck and later had rheumatic fever. As a teenager, he started playing basketball and baseball at Holy Name of Mary School until he moved with his family to Lake Worth, Florida. In 1952, he threw six no-hitters for the Lake Worth Community High School baseball team, when the school won its only state baseball championship.\\n\\nOn June 7, 1952 (his 19th birthday), he signed a baseball contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was sent to Indianapolis of the American Association where he made 10 pitching starts. In 1953, he moved to Cleveland\\'s Class A affiliate, Reading (Pennsylvania) of the Eastern League. At Reading, he became a roommate and lifetime friend with Rocky Colavito, a near future Cleveland Indians home run hitter and right fielder from the Bronx, New York. For the 1954 season, both were promoted to Triple-A Indianapolis. Score was named \"The Sporting News\" Minor League Player of the Year and began to be referred to as \"left-handed Bob Feller\".\\n\\nSection::::MLB playing career.\\nSection::::Cleveland Indians (1955â1959).\\nIn , Score came up to the Major Leagues (with Colavito) as a rookie with the Cleveland Indians at the age of 21. He quickly became one of the top power pitchers in the American League, no small feat on a team that still included Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and other top pitchers, going 16â10 with a 2.85 Earned run average (ERA) in his first year. He appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine on May 30, 1955. Score struck out 245 batters in 1955, a Major League rookie record that stood until , when it was topped by Dwight Gooden (Score, Gooden, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Don Sutton, Gary Nolan, Kerry Wood, Mark Langston, and Hideo Nomo were the only eight rookie pitchers to top 200 strikeouts in the 20th century). It was the first time in MLB history a regular starting pitcher averaged over one strikeout per inning.\\n\\nIn , Score improved on his rookie campaign, going 20â9 with a 2.53 ERA and 263 strikeouts, while reducing the number of walks from 154 to 129, and allowed only 5.85 hits/9 innings, which would stand as a franchise record until it was broken by Luis Tiant\\'s 5.30 in .\\n\\nSection::::Injury from Gil McDougald\\'s line drive.\\nOn May 7, , during the first inning of a night game against the New York Yankees at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Score threw a low fastball to Gil McDougald with Jim Hegan catching. McDougald lined the pitch to the mound and struck Score in the face, breaking Score\\'s facial bones and injuring his eye. The ball caromed to third baseman Al Smith, who threw McDougald out before he rushed to the pitching mound to aid Score. McDougald, seeing Score hit by the baseball and then lying down and injured, also ran immediately to the pitching mound, instead of first base, to help Score. McDougald reportedly vowed to retire if Score permanently lost his sight in one eye as a result of the accident. Score eventually recovered his 20/20 vision, though he missed the rest of the season.\\n\\nHe returned early in the season. Though many believe Score feared being hit by another batted ball, and thus changed his pitching motion, Score himself rejected that theory. Score would tell Cleveland sportswriter Terry Pluto (for \"The Curse of Rocky Colavito\") that, in 1958, after pitching and winning a few games and feeling better than he\\'d felt in a long time, he tore a tendon in his arm while pitching on a damp night against the Washington Senators and sat out the rest of the season.\\n\\nIn 1959, he had shifted his pitching motion in a bid to avoid another, similar injury. \"The reason my motion changed\", Score told Pluto, \"was because I hurt my elbow, and I overcompensated for it and ended up with some bad habits.\" As a result of the changes Score made in his pitching delivery, his velocity dropped and he incurred further injuries. Score pitched the full season, going 9â11 with a 4.71 ERA and 147 strikeouts.\\n\\nIn the book \"The Greatest Team Of All Time\" (Bob Adams, Inc, publisher. 1994), Mickey Mantle picked Score as the toughest American League left-handed pitcher he faced (before the injury). Yogi Berra picked Score for his \"Greatest Team Of All Time\".\\n\\nSection::::Chicago White Sox (1960â1962).\\nScore was traded to the Chicago White Sox by Cleveland on April 18, 1960 for pitcher Barry Latman. Score\\'s roommate, Colavito, was traded to the Detroit Tigers the day before. Score was reunited on the Chicago team with some former Indians players and manager Al Lopez. Score pitched parts of the following three seasons before retiring. He finished with a major league career record of 55â46, a 3.36 ERA, and 837 strikeouts over eight seasons in 858 innings pitched.\\n\\nSection::::MLB broadcasting career.\\nScore retired from playing baseball in 1962. Beginning in 1964, he was employed as a television and radio play-by-play announcer with the Cleveland Indians for the next 34 years, first on television from to , and then on radio from to , the longest career for an Indians play-by-play announcer. Score was revered by the Indians fans for his announcing style, including a low voice and a low-key style, as well as a habit of occasionally mispronouncing the names of players on opposing teams. Score\\'s final Major League Baseball game as an announcer was Game 7 of the 1997 World Series.\\n\\nSection::::Retirement and death.\\nOn October 8, 1998, while driving to Florida after being inducted into the Broadcasters Hall of Fame the night before, Score was severely injured in a traffic accident. He pulled into the path of a westbound tractor-trailer truck near New Philadelphia, Ohio, and his car was struck in the passenger side. He suffered trauma to his brain, chest, and lungs. The orbital bone around one of his eyes was fractured, as were three ribs and his sternum. He spent over a month in the intensive care unit, and was released from MetroHealth Hospital in mid-December. He was cited for failure to stop at a stop sign.\\n\\nHe went through a difficult recovery, but managed to throw out the first pitch at the Indians\\' Opening Day on April 12, 1999. He suffered a stroke in 2002, and died on November 11, 2008, at his home in Rocky River, Ohio, after a lengthy illness. He is interred at Lakewood Park Cemetery in Rocky River.

In 1909 he became the editor of the \"Washington Times\". He left this post in 1917 to become Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy and to serve as a member of the Committee on Public Information under George Creel and as publicity director for United States Navy during the First World War until 1921. In this Navy connection McIntyre first met Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy.\\n\\nHe served as publicity representative and business manager for several of FDR\\'s campaigns and after the Democratic defeat in 1920, he remained in Washington DC, contributing articles to Army and Navy Journals and later becoming representative of the PathÃ© News Reel Company.

(film)\\n\\nStar! (re-titled Those Were the Happy Times for its 1969 re-release) is a 1968 American biographical musical film directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews. The screenplay by William Fairchild is based on the life and career of British performer Gertrude Lawrence.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nThe film opens in 1940, with Lawrence in a screening room watching a documentary film chronicling her life, then flashes back to Clapham in 1915, when she leaves home to join her vaudevillian father in a dilapidated Brixton music hall. Eventually she joins the chorus in AndrÃ© Charlot\\'s West End revue. She reunites with close childhood friend NoÃ«l Coward who provides witty commentary on Gertie\\'s actions.\\n\\nCharlot becomes annoyed with Gertie\\'s efforts to stand out, literally, from the chorus. He threatens to fire her, but stage manager Jack Roper intercedes and gets her hired as a general understudy to the leads. She marries Jack, but it becomes clear she is more inclined to perform onstage than stay home and play wife. While pregnant, she insists on going on for an absent star, and captivates the audience with her own star-making performance of \"Burlington Bertie\". Charlot and Roper witness the audience\\'s warm approval, and both realize, Charlot grudgingly and Roper wistfully, that Gertie belongs on the stage.\\n\\nAfter their daughter Pamela is born, Gertrude is angered when Roper takes the baby on a pub crawl, and leaves him. A subsequent courtship with Sir Anthony Spencer, an English nobleman, polishes Gertie\\'s rough edges and transforms her into a lady. Caught at a chic supper club when she is supposed to be on a sick day, she is fired from the Charlot Revue. Squired by Spencer, she becomes a \\'society darling\\'. Coward then convinces Charlot to feature her in his new production, and she is finally recognized as a star. When the revue opens in New York City, she dallies with an actor and a banker, bringing the number of her suitors to three.\\n\\nGertrude faces financial ruin after spending all her considerable earnings, but ultimately manages to pay back her creditors and retain her glamour. As her career soars, her long-distance relationship with her daughter deteriorates. When Pamela cancels an anticipated holiday with Gertie, she gets extremely drunk and insults a roomful of people at a surprise birthday party thrown by Coward. Among the people insulted at the party is American theatre producer Richard Aldrich. When he returns to escort the hungover star home, he gives an honest appraisal of her. She is insulted, then intrigued by him, making an unannounced visit to his Cape Playhouse where she proposes to play the lead. They argue at rehearsal. He proposes marriage; she throws him out.\\n\\nBack on Broadway, she has trouble getting a handle on a crucial \"The Saga of Jenny\" number in \"Lady in the Dark\". Aldrich turns up at a daunting rehearsal where he observes her frustration and takes her, with Coward, out to a nightclub. She protests, then realizes the kind of performance they are watching is the key to her dilemma in the show. Coward pronounces him \"a very clever man\". After a rousing performance of \"Jenny\", the film ends with her marriage to Aldrich, eight years before her triumph in \"The King and I\" and untimely death from liver cancer at the age of 54.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nAccording to extensive production details provided in the DVD release of the film, when Julie Andrews signed on to star in \"The Sound of Music\", her contract with Twentieth Century-Fox was a two-picture deal. As \"The Sound of Music\" neared completion, director Robert Wise and producer Saul Chaplin had grown so fond of her that they wanted to make sure that their team would be the one to pick up the studio\\'s option for the other picture \"before anybody else got to her first\". Wise\\'s story editor Max Lamb suggested a biopic of Lawrence and, although Andrews previously had rejected offers to portray the entertainer, she was as keen to work with Wise and Chaplin again as they were to work with her, and she subsequently warmed to their approach to the story. She signed for $1 million against 10 percent of the gross plus 35 cents for each soundtrack album sold.\\n\\nOnce Andrews was on board, Wise bought the rights to both Lawrence\\'s 1945 autobiography \"A Star Danced\" and her second husband\\'s 1954 memoir \"Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.\" Max Lamb did extensive research, including numerous interviews with people who actually had known Lawrence. It became clear that the interviews provided a more accurate account than the rosy picture in the books, so they became the basis of the screenplay. Wise felt it was important to hire a British screenwriter, and he decided on William Fairchild. The contrast of the rosy impression of her life in the books with the less glamorous real story from the interviews found its way into the script, which initially had an animated Lawrence telling the story while the live version played out what (more or less) really happened. Eventually, Fairchild suggested Lawrence\\'s story be told in (color) flashback while she watched a (black-and-white) documentary about her life, thus allowing the real Lawrence in a screening room set to comment on the veracity of the character Lawrence in the film within the film.\\n\\nFairchild\\'s screenplay renamed, replaced or combined some real people, for dramatic and legal reasons. Two of Lawrence\\'s closest friends, NoÃ«l Coward and Beatrice Lillie, were approached regarding the rights to portray them in the film. While Coward was generally supportive, suggesting only small alterations to his character\\'s dialogue, Lillie had a manager who demanded that she play herself, in addition to numerous script changes that enlarged her role. Wise then asked Fairchild to find the name of another female performer Lawrence had worked with who was already dead. Billie Carleton became the composite character that replaced Lillie in the film. When Lawrence reconnects with her wayward father in the film, he is performing in music halls with a mature woman who joins him when he departs for a job in South Africa. In reality Rose was a chorus girl not much older than Lawrence, and she remained in the UK. On screen, Lawrence\\'s first husband Jack Roper is roughly her age, whereas in real life his name was Francis Gordon-Howley and he was twenty years her senior. Her upper-class Guardsman boyfriend, actually Capt. Philip Astley, is identified as Sir Tony Spencer on screen, and the Wall Street financier named Ben Mitchell in the film was really Bert Taylor.\\n\\nDaniel Massey, who portrayed NoÃ«l Coward, was Coward\\'s godson in real life. His performance earned one of the seven Academy Award nominations for the film. In his commentary for the laserdisc and DVD release of the film, Massey reveals he was unhappy with the sound of his voice when he saw the film for the first time. As production wrapped in late 1967, heâat his own requestâre-dubbed all of his dialogue before returning home to London. Massey\\'s commentary also recounts a conversation in which Coward addressed his own sexual orientation, which is barely hinted at in the film. Massey quotes Coward saying \"I\\'ve tried it all, from soup to nuts...\" confirming his preference for the latter.\\n\\nMichael Kidd choreographed the musical sequences. Both he and Andrews have talked about his pushing her beyond what she thought her limits were, particularly for \"Burlington Bertie\" and \"Jenny\"âwhich turned out to be among her best moments on film. Andrews has said that her lasting friendship with Kidd and his dance assistant and wife Shelah is one of the things she valued most from the experience. Boris Leven was responsible for the production design and his sets took over nine different stages on the Fox lot. Fashion designer Donald Brooks designed 3,040 individual costumes for the film, including a record 125 outfits for Andrews alone. The $750,000 cost of Andrews\\' wardrobe was subsidized by Western Costume company, which took ownership after filming. Western rented them out to many subsequent TV and movie productions, (including \"Funny Lady\") for over 20 years, then auctioned most of them, along with hundreds of other famous costumes, at Butterfield & Butterfield\\'s in West Hollywood.\\n\\nSection::::Theatrical release.\\nAt a time when the popularity of roadshow theatrical releases in general, and musicals in particular, were on the wane, the United States was one of the last countries in which the film was released. When the film was in production, 15,000 people responded to promotional ads placed by 20th Century Fox for advance ticket sales in New York City, but a year later, when the studio followed up by mailing them order forms, only a very small percentage actually bought tickets. Sales were higher for Wednesday matinees than for Saturday nights, which indicated that a crucial componentâyoung adultsâwould not be a large part of the picture\\'s audience. The film opened in the US with little advance sale, and good-to-mediocre reviews.\\n\\n\"Star!\" was a commercial disappointment in its initial run, suffering about 20 minutes of studio-requested and director-approved cuts, while still in its roadshow engagements. Hoping to recoup some of its estimated $14 million cost, 20th Century Fox executive Richard Zanuck decided to do some primitive \"market research\" (testing three titles: \"Music for the Lady\", \"Those Were the Happy Days\" and \"Star!\"), before withdrawing the film in the spring of 1969. The studio then proceeded to substantially cut and re-market the film under a new title, \"Those Were the Happy Times\". Wise, who did not believe cutting the film would work, declined to be involved in the editing, and asked that the credit \"A Robert Wise Film\" be removed. Following instructions from Zanuck, William H. Reynolds, the film\\'s original editor, reluctantly but very competently removed scenes and whole sequences, including many of the musical numbers, paring the film\\'s running time from 175 to 120 minutes, (which involved overlapping sound and adding a new shot to bridge some cuts). A very simple new title card was created as well. However, when the short retitled version was released in the fall of 1969, the changes left some holes in the plot, and did little to improve box office receipts. The fact that the reissue was to be shown only in 35mm coincidentally saved the original camera negative of the film from being altered.\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nRenata Adler of \"The New York Times\" observed, \"A lot of the sets are lovely, Daniel Massey acts beautifully as a kind of warmed NÃ¶el Coward, and the film, which gets richer and better as it goes along, has a nice scene from \"Private Lives\". People who like old-style musicals should get their money\\'s worth. So should people who like Julie Andrews. But people who liked Gertrude Lawrence had better stick with their record collections and memories.\"\\n\\n\"Variety\" said, \"Julie Andrews\\' portrayal . . . occasionally sags between musical numbers but the cast and team of redoubtable technical contributors have helped to turn out a pleasing tribute to one of the theatre\\'s most admired stars. It gives a fascinating coverage of Lawrence\\'s spectacular rise to showbiz fame, and also a neatly observed background of an epoch now gone.\"\\n\\n\"Time Out London\" says, \"Wise\\'s biopic hardly deserved the rough treatment it received from most critics and audiences, who had been led by the studio\\'s advertising to expect another \"Sound of Music\". This was a far more ambitious project; it backfired, but it backfired with a certain amount of honour. Daniel Massey\\'s mincing portrayal of his godfather NoÃ«l Coward wins hands down over all the other impersonations.\"\\n\\n\"TV Guide\" thought \"it deserved a better fate for its enormous score, top-flight production, excellent choreography, and fine acting\".\\n\\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the film as \"stylish, sharp-edged, and underrated\".\\n\\nSection::::Awards and nominations.\\nSection::::Academy Awards.\\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning none:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Television and home video.\\nThe film debuted on American television in a truncated form, but with its original title. Within a week, it was broadcast in the United Kingdom at its original length, with only the overture and entr\\'acte eliminated.\\n\\nOne unusual feature about the uncut original version of the film was that, like many released today, it had no opening credits. The only credits seen at the beginning were fictitious â those of the newsreel film within the film â about Gertrude Lawrence, which, after an onscreen overture, is the first thing the audience viewing the film sees. The Twentieth Century-Fox logo was seen only as part of that newsreel, not as part of the actual film, and appeared only in black-and-white. Director Robert Wise had to obtain special permission for putting the main title credits at the end of the film. Initially there were no cast of characters credits which would typically come at the end because (like \"Fantasia\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") a special program was to be given to the audience. However at the last minute, a cast of characters roll was added. Because of its late inclusion, it was not scored, a detail that was corrected for the first laserdisc and VHS release after consulting with the producer and director. The music used came from the instrumental bridge and second verse of the title song as originally released on a 45RPM single record.\\n\\nAfter the complete version had been unseen and thought lost for nearly 20 years, the rental library Films, Inc. had a new 35mm mono print struck in the late 80s. Numerous screenings on the revival theatre circuit, a two-part article in a movie collector newspaper, and a worldwide letter writing campaign by fans, were followed by an article in Premiere Magazine, an acclaimed debut of the complete version on US cable TV, and a long-awaited release on home video. All this attention has earned \"Star!\" a reputation as an underrated \"lost classic\" and a cult favorite.\\n\\nAfter being transferred to video with the director\\'s supervision in 1993, a new 35mm print was struck for the 25th Anniversary screening in November at the Directors Guild of America Theatre in Hollywood, CA. This print carried the new Dolby Stereo soundtrack created for the video and laserdisc, which mixed down from the original six channel magnetic soundtrack (Screen Left, Left Center, Center, Right Center, Screen Right and Audience Surround) to four channels (Screen Left, Center, Screen Right, and Audience Surround). The gala screening reunited many cast members with the Director Robert Wise, Producer Saul Chaplin, Choreographer Michael Kidd, Dance Assistant Shelah Hackett Kidd, and Julie Andrews, who was welcomed by a standing ovation from a packed house.\\n\\nWhile the initial US video release (on VHS and Laserdisc) featured a transfer of the entire 176 minute film (from the original 65mm camera negative and six-channel magnetic soundtrack), the DVD, mastered from 35mm elements, runs only 173 minutes, because Fox cut the intermission/entr\\'acte sequence. The laserdisc received a very favorable review from Laserdisc Newsletter, however fans have since written in online reviews and home theatre forums criticizing the DVD for, among other things, loss of the intermission/entr\\'acte, inaccurate framing, sound mix, and color (particularly the sepia tint the DVD added to the B&W sequences not being the original filmmakers\\' choice). Long after laserdiscs stopped being a current format, fans have stated in some forums that they still preferred to watch the laserdisc rather than the DVD.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Star!

They went on hiatus in 2002 and reunited in 2013.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Formation.\\nThe Gathering Field legacy began in a burned-out third floor in Grove City, Pennsylvania, when Bill Deasy, Dave Brown and Rusted Root percussionist Jim DiSpirito \"isolated themselves for the weekend with guitars, tequila, microphones and recording gear\". An obscure, rare recording was born out of that weekend, appropriately titled \"The Lost Weekend\", which was never made commercially available.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nThe Gathering Field line-up ultimately became Deasy on vocals and acoustic guitar, Brown on lead guitar, Eric Riebling on bass and Ray DeFade as drummer. Their first independent release, the self-titled \"The Gathering Field\", was met with great reception around the region and they started playing to packed clubs. However, the band\\'s popularity really skyrocketed when one of the region\\'s most powerful rock radio stations, WDVE, began playing a song called, \"Lost in America\". The song remained in rotation for over seven months. Based on the success of the self-titled CD, the group garnered a major label deal with Atlantic Records, who re-released their album.\\n\\nSoon after they signed to Atlantic Records and \"Lost in America\" was re-released, there was turmoil at the label. The album charted on the \"Billboard\" Top 100 album chart, Radio and Records and various other industry publications but ultimately the CD and group got lost in the shuffle and they attempted to be released from their contract. DeFade left the group and was replaced with Joe Zelek. When they finally succeeded, they released two more CDs; \"Reliance\" and \"So Close to Home,\" the latter consisting of songs the band had played live for several years but never recorded. During that time Deasy also released a semi-acoustic solo album called \"Spring Lies Waiting\", produced by Brown.\\n\\nSection::::Hiatus.\\nRefusing to use the words \"break-up\" when describing their status, The Gathering Field went on an \"infinite hiatus\" in 2002. \\n\\nDeasy now records as a solo artist and continues to be a prolific songwriter. His song \"Good Things Are Happening\" was the theme for ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America\" from 2001 to 2004. Since his departure from The Gathering Field, he has recorded with artists such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp and Patty Griffin. His music has been recorded by Martina McBride, Billy Ray Cyrus, Howard Jones, Kim Richey and The Clarks.\\n\\nZelek formed the Joe Zelek Band. They had their music used by television stations such as WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio, WFTV in Orlando, Florida, and Fox Sports West in Los Angeles, California. The band has also played the main stage at the Jamboree in the Hills since 2007.\\n\\nRiebling continues to record music, and has emerged as a web designer for several artists and groups that he has been associated with.\\n\\nSection::::Reunion.\\nIn November 2013, Bill Deasy announced during an interview on WYEP that the Gathering Field was reuniting and would immediately begin playing live shows again.

He was Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 1996, Serie A Footballer of the Year in 2001, and La Liga Best Foreign Player in 2002. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world\\'s greatest living players compiled by PelÃ©, and in the same year was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. Zidane is one of eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d\\'Or, and was the ambassador for Qatar\\'s successful bid to stage the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the first Arab country to host the tournament.\\n\\nAfter retiring as a player, Zidane transitioned into coaching, and began as his head coaching career at Real Madrid Castilla. He remained in the position for two years before taking the helm of the first team in January 2016. In his two and a half seasons with Madrid, Zidane won the UEFA Champions League an unprecedented three times consecutively, a La Liga title, a Supercopa de EspaÃ±a, and the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup twice each. His success saw him named Best FIFA Men\\'s Coach in 2017, but he resigned in May 2018. Following poor results by Real Madrid in the subsequent months, Zidane returned to the club as manager in March 2019.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nZinedine Yazid Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille, in Southern France. He is the youngest of five siblings. Zidane is of Algerian Kabyle descent. His parents, SmaÃ¯l and Malika, emigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War. The family, which had settled in the city\\'s tough northern districts of BarbÃ¨s and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille.\\n\\nHis father worked as a warehouseman and nightwatchman at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife. The family lived a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighbourhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates. Zidane credits his strict upbringing and his father as the \"guiding light\" in his career.\\n\\nIt was in Castellane where Zidane had his earliest introduction in football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood\\'s children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex. In July 2011, Zidane named former Marseille players BlaÅ¾ SliÅ¡koviÄ, Enzo Francescoli and Jean-Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up. At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player\\'s licence after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri. After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO SeptÃ¨mes-les-Vallons when the SeptÃ¨mes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club\\'s Director to get Zidane. Zidane stayed with SeptÃ¨mes until the age of 14, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the CREPS (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in Aix-en-Provence, one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation. It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout and former player Jean Varraud, who recommended him to the training centre director of the club. As a 14 year old watching the 1986 World Cup, the performance of Diego Maradona left an indelible mark on him, with Zidane stating Maradona \"was on another level\".\\n\\nSection::::Club career.\\nSection::::Cannes.\\nZidane went to AS Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes Director Jean-Claude Elineau to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that while living with the Elineaus he found equilibrium.\\n\\nIt was at Cannes where Zidane\\'s first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive, prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family. His first coach, Jean Varraud, encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game. Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins. The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being an Algerian-Frenchman suspended between cultures, and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up.\\n\\nZidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 in a French Division 1 match against Nantes. He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991 also against Nantes in a 2â1 win. After the match during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was given a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club. On the pitch, Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball, offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game. In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup after finishing fourth in the league. This remains the club\\'s highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948â49 season.\\n\\nSection::::Bordeaux.\\nZidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992â93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruhe, and finishing runner-up against Bayern Munich in the 1995â96 UEFA Cup, in four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, \"Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?\" Also towards the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for Â£1.2\\xa0million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division. In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year.\\n\\nSection::::Juventus.\\nAfter a series of stand out performances for both Bordeaux and France, Zidane had offers to join Europe\\'s top clubs in the spring of 1996, deciding on a move to UEFA Champions League winners Juventus during the close season. Zidane\\'s impact in Italy was immediate, winning the 1996â97 Serie A title and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup. He was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year in his first season. Zidane\\'s growing status in the sport saw him chosen in a European XI to face a World XI â featuring a forward line of Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta â in December 1997.\\n\\nAs the playmaker at Juve, Zidane played just behind forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Del Piero recalling, \"Zidane had an extraordinary talent, which contributed to his sole interest in helping the team. He was not a selfish player. He had a unique ability to be a great and to be a team player. I was lucky to play with him.\" He lost in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final 3â1 to Borussia Dortmund when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of Paul Lambert.\\n\\nThe following season, Zidane scored seven goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the 1997â98 Serie A and thus retain the \"Scudetto\". In Europe, Juventus made their third consecutive UEFA Champions League Final appearance, but lost the game 1â0 to Real Madrid. In 1998, Zidane was named FIFA World Player of the Year, and won the Ballon d\\'Or. Juventus finished second in the 2000â01 Serie A, but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, after Zidane was banned for head-butting Hamburger SV player Jochen Kientz. In 2001, Zidane was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second time.\\n\\nSection::::Real Madrid.\\nIn 2001, Zidane joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of 150\\xa0billion Italian lire, (about â¬77.5\\xa0million by fixed exchange rate; a reported 12.8\\xa0billion pesetas) in instalments, and signed a four-year contract. The latest addition to the \"GalÃ¡cticos\" era of global stars signed by Real Madrid every year, in his first season at the club Zidane scored a famous match-winning goal, a volley hit with his weaker foot, in Madrid\\'s 2â1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final, completing his personal quadruple. The goal has been cited as one of the greatest in Champions League history. The magnitude of the strike saw Zidane produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran towards the touchline with mouth wide open, screaming in delight.\\nThe next season, Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the 2002â03 La Liga, starring alongside LuÃ­s Figo in midfield, and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year for the third time. In 2004, fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in UEFA\\'s fiftieth-anniversary Golden Jubilee Poll.\\n\\nWhile Zidane\\'s final season of club football ended without a trophy, he enjoyed success on a personal note by scoring his first hat-trick, against Sevilla, in a 4â2 win in January 2006. He ended the season for Real Madrid as their second highest goalscorer and assists provider behind teammates Ronaldo and David Beckham respectively, with nine goals and ten assists in 28 games. On 7 May 2006, Zidane, who had announced his plans to retire after the 2006 World Cup, played his farewell match and scored in a 3â3 draw with Villarreal. The squad wore commemorative shirts with \"ZIDANE 2001â2006\" below the club logo. The 80,000 fans inside the Santiago BernabÃ©u held up a banner reading, \"Thanks for the magic.\"\\n\\nIn 2012, Zidane featured for Madrid in an All Stars Match against Manchester United which resulted in a 3â2 win for Real. In April 2013, he was named by \"Marca\" as a member of the \"Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid\\'s history.\"\\n\\nSection::::International career.\\nBoth France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen. It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough. However, Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.\\n\\nZidane was a member of the French under-21 squad that won a bronze medal at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon.\\nHe earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2â2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2â0 deficit. After Eric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position.\\n\\nSection::::Euro 1996.\\nDespite not being at his best during the tournament, France reached the last four. Zidane was not yet fully established in the French team and his level was quite average during the whole event, but he managed to score in the penalty shootout in both the quarter-final and semi-final. France was eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout against the Czech Republic.\\n\\nSection::::1998 World Cup.\\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in. It was held in his home country France. The French team won all three games in the group stage but Zidane was sent off in the second match against Saudi Arabia for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup Finals match. Without their playmaker France proceeded to win 1â0 in the round of sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy 4â3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter-finals. France then defeated Croatia 2â1 in the semi-final. Zidane played a major role in the team\\'s accomplishment, though he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.\\n\\nZidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two similar goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff. Courtesy of Zidane\\'s two goals, France went into the half-time break 2â0 up with one hand on the World Cup trophy. Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3â0 win and France\\'s first ever World Cup. Named man of the match, Zidane became an instant national hero and would receive the LÃ©gion d\\'honneur later that year. More than one million people lined the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in Paris, with celebrations centred around the Arc de Triomphe.\\n\\nSection::::Euro 2000.\\nTwo years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a bending free kick against Spain in the quarter-final and the golden goal in the semi-final against Portugal with a penalty. UEFA named Zidane Player of the Tournament.\\n\\nZidane himself believes he was at his peak during the tournament, while the UEFA website states, \"In Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane dominated a major championship in a way no individual had managed since Diego Maradona in 1986. From the opening game against Denmark to the final against Italy, \\'Zizou\\' shone brightly, casting a spell on his opponents with clever flicks, mesmerising stepovers, slaloming runs and masterful vision.\"\\n\\nSection::::2002 World Cup.\\nAs reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup in Japan/Korea as favourites but a thigh injury sustained in a warm up match before the tournament prevented Zidane from playing in France\\'s first two matches and without their talisman, the French team failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.\\n\\nSection::::Euro 2004.\\nAt Euro 2004, France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland, before being knocked out in the quarter finals by eventual champions Greece in a surprise 1â0 loss. In the opening match against England, Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn impending defeat into a 2â1 victory. After France\\'s elimination, Zidane announced his retirement from international football.\\n\\nSection::::2006 World Cup.\\nWith the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. At the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain. Zidane, along with Thuram and Makelele, made his competitive return for France in a 3â0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 September 2005. The trio helped France rise from fourth place to win their qualifying group. On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1â0 friendly win over Mexico, in what would also be his last match at the Stade de France. Zidane became France\\'s fourth player to reach 100 caps, after Desailly, Thuram and Didier Deschamps.\\n\\nFrance had a slow start to the 2006 Finals and, after being suspended for the third match of the group stage, Zidane returned to set up a goal for Patrick Vieira and score one himself in the second round match against Spain. In the quarter-final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted Thierry Henry\\'s deciding goal and was named Man of the Match by FIFA. France faced Portugal in the semi-final and, as in Brussels six years earlier, Zidane\\'s penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.\\n\\nBefore the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament. Having already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005â06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane\\'s second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the match Zidane put France ahead with a Panenka-style penalty kick which struck the crossbar and bounced just over the goal line to become only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with PelÃ©, Paul Breitner, and VavÃ¡, in addition to being tied for first place with VavÃ¡, PelÃ© and Geoff Hurst with three World Cup final goals apiece. He almost scored a second goal during the first period of extra time but his header was saved by Italy\\'s goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Zidane was then sent off in the 110th minute of the game after headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest, so he did not participate in the penalty shootout which Italy won 5â3. Zidane\\'s actions made headlines all over the world, while in France \"Le Figaro\" called his head-butt \"odious,\" and the front page of \"L\\'Equipe\" asked, \"What should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?\"\\n\\nUpon his return to France, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting \"Zizou! Zizou!,\" and tributes were led by the French president Jacques Chirac. Chirac\\'s words reflected the feeling of the French public, with polls done in the immediate wake of the incident showing support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them. According to French journalist Philippe Auclair, Zidane\\'s performances in the knock-out rounds were \"ranked among his finest in a blue shirt.\" As the player of the tournament, Zidane had given the team hope, with the French daily newspaper \"LibÃ©ration\" stating, \"For a month, France was dreaming with Zidane.\" Zidane remained an icon to the French public, and one French writer stated, \"It\\'s good for us to see our national hero is fallible.\" It was later revealed through interviews that Marco Materazzi had insulted Zidane\\'s sister, which led to Zidane\\'s heightened anger and reaction. In 2010, Zidane said that he would \"rather die than apologize\" to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final, but also admitted that he \"could never have lived with himself\" had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match. He later said, \"If you look at the fourteen red cards I had in my career, twelve of them were a result of provocation. This isn\\'t justification, this isn\\'t an excuse, but my passion, temper and blood made me react.\"\\n\\nFollowing his red card in the final, Zidane retired from professional football and confirmed that he would not go back on his decision. He was sentenced by FIFA to a three match suspension for the red card. He agreed to complete three days of community service with children in one of FIFA\\'s humanitarian projects. Zidane ended up tying with Brazil\\'s Cafu for the record for most cards given in World Cup matches, with six.\\n\\nSection::::Retirement.\\nSince his retirement, Zidane has regularly played for the Real Madrid Veterans team. He has also made several futsal appearances. In 2015 he played in a futsal tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during which an opposition player received a yellow card to much amusement for taking an in-match selfie with Zidane. In an interview in June 2008, Zidane stated that he wanted to return to football, but that he had no immediate plans to do so.\\n\\nOn 1 June 2009, Zidane was announced as the advisor to the president after Florentino PÃ©rez was named president of Real Madrid for the second time. He, along with general director Jorge Valdano and sporting director Miguel Pardeza, were to be the key decisionmakers on the sporting side of the club. After France\\'s dismal campaign in the 2010 World Cup, Zidane said that he did not plan to move into coaching any time soon.\\n\\nQatar\\'s 2022 World Cup bid committee announced in September 2010 that Zidane had been appointed as an ambassador for Qatar\\'s attempt to host the 2022 World Cup. After FIFA announced on 2 December 2010 that Qatar had won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Zidane stated that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome. Zidane spoke of the message he was trying to convey in the campaign: \"I was saying that football belonged to the whole world. Iâm proud to have made my contribution to a new country getting the World Cup. Qatar and the entire Middle East as a whole deserves this event and that makes me happy. It\\'s a victory for the Arab world.\" Zidane has supported two Olympic bids for Paris, including the 2012 Summer Olympics which was narrowly won by London and later Paris\\' successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Paris will also be hosting the 2024 Summer Paralympics.\\n\\nSection::::Charity activities.\\nOn 24 February 2007, before a crowd of 10,000 fans at a match in northern Thailand for the Keuydaroon children\\'s AIDS charity, Zidane scored the first goal and set up the second for a Malaysian teammate as the match ended 2â2. The event raised à¸¿260,000 ($7,750). This money paid for the building of two schools and 16 three-bedroom houses.\\n\\nOn 19 November 2008, Zidane took part in the fifth annual Match Against Poverty in MÃ¡laga, Spain, which also ended in a 2â2 draw; he went scoreless but set up his team\\'s second goal. He and Ronaldo, who collaborated in conceiving the yearly event to benefit the United Nations Development Programme, regularly captain their respective teams consisting of active footballers, other professional athletes and celebrities. Zidane, a UN Goodwill Ambassador since 2001, stated before the game that \"everyone can do something to make the world a better place.\"\\n\\nIn June and July 2009, Zidane toured across Canada with stops in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Although billed as Zidane and \"Friends\", the likes of which included Fabien Barthez and Samuel Eto\\'o, the exhibition matches featured local players. Some proceeds were given to UNICEF.\\n\\nOn 6 June 2010, Zidane took part in the biennial charity event Soccer Aid. He played for the Rest of the World team, managed by former Liverpool and Celtic forward Kenny Dalglish against England alongside former Real Madrid teammate LuÃ­s Figo and Celtic legend Henrik Larsson. He played against former players such as Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer, as well as celebrities such as Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers, Michael Sheen, chef Gordon Ramsay, actor Damian Lewis and singer Robbie Williams. The match took place at Old Trafford, Manchester and was won by the Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by Harrelson after a 2â2 draw.\\n\\nOn 2 June 2013, Zidane took part in a charity match played at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United Legends vs. Real Madrid Legends reverse fixture. The first leg took place in Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium. Part of a team that included the likes of Figo, Fernando Redondo and Manolo SanchÃ­s, the fixture raised funds for the Manchester United Foundation. The 12th Match against Poverty took place in Saint-Ãtienne, France on Monday 20 April 2015, where Ronaldo and Zidane teamed up with other football stars against past and present players of French Ligue 1 club AS Saint-Ãtienne. According to UNDP, \"two-thirds of all proceeds will go towards helping the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone build back better from the Ebola epidemic.\" In June 2018, Zidane reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star side which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. In a 3â2 win for France, Thierry Henry played a no-look one-two pass with Zidane before scoring, with Zidane then curling in a 25-yard free kick.\\n\\nSection::::Managerial career.\\nIn November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid\\'s first team in response to an appeal made by then-Real Madrid coach JosÃ© Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach. In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid\\'s new sporting director. In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.\\n\\nSection::::Real Madrid Castilla.\\nIn June 2014, Real Madrid announced that Zidane would be the coach of Real Madrid\\'s B team, Real Madrid Castilla. On 29 August, the director of the Spanish National Football Coach Education Centre (CENAFE), Miguel GalÃ¡n, reported Zidane for acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach without the necessary coaching badges. According to GalÃ¡n, \"No one who has anything to do with the football world can be unaware that Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach this season. It is a fait accompli that has been widely accepted, as shown by media reports, and Real Madrid do not deny it.\" While the official match report for Castilla\\'s opening game in the Segunda DivisiÃ³n B lists Santiago SÃ¡nchez as the \"Los Blancos\"\\' head coach and Zidane as his assistant, GalÃ¡n states, \"This hierarchy only exists on paper. The truth is the exact opposite: Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach, while, with all due respect to him as a colleague, Mr SÃ¡nchez\\'s role basically boils down to providing the badges.\"\\n\\nSection::::Real Madrid.\\nOn 4 January 2016, Real Madrid announced the dismissal of manager Rafael BenÃ­tez and on the same day Zidane was appointed the new manager of the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal. His first match as the club\\'s new manager took place five days later, when Real Madrid beat Deportivo La CoruÃ±a 5â0 in a La Liga match. In his first \"El ClÃ¡sico\" as a manager, held on 2 April at the Camp Nou, Zidane led his club to a 2â1 win over Barcelona to end BarÃ§a\\'s 39-match unbeaten run. Zidane thus became the first Real Madrid manager to win his first \"ClÃ¡sico\" match since Bernd Schuster in December 2007.\\n\\nOn 4 May, Zidane led Real Madrid to a place in the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final by beating Manchester City 1â0 on aggregate. In La Liga, Real Madrid finished runners up, just one point behind Barcelona. In the Champions League final on 28 May, Real Madrid defeated fellow Madrid club AtlÃ©tico Madrid in a penalty shootout to grab the 11th European Cup (\"La UndÃ©cima\") in club history. Zidane became the seventh man to win the European Cup (now UEFA Champions League) as both a player and a manager, the second man (after Miguel MuÃ±oz) to win the trophy with Real Madrid as both a player and a manager, and the first French manager, except the French-Argentinian Helenio Herrera, to win the trophy.\\n\\nIn his first full-season as manager, Real Madrid recorded a club-record 16th consecutive La Liga victory by defeating Espanyol 2â0 away on 18 September 2016, overtaking their previous record of 15 set in 1960â61 and equalling the record of consecutive La Liga wins of Barcelona set in 2010â11. On 18 December, Real Madrid defeated Japanese club Kashima Antlers 4â2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick.\\n\\nOn 12 January 2017, Madrid\\'s draw against Sevilla FC in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 saw him win his 40th consecutive match without a loss â creating a new Spanish record, beating Luis Enrique\\'s record of 39 matches undefeated with Barcelona. Zidane later led Madrid to the La Liga title, their 33rd in history, by defeating MÃ¡laga 2â0.\\n\\nOn 3 June 2017, Zidane led Real Madrid to a 4â1 win against Italian side Juventus in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final at Cardiff to grab the club\\'s 12th European Cup (\"La DuodÃ©cima\"). This victory meant that Madrid were the first ever team to win the Champions League back-to-back, as well as recording Zidane\\'s first double as coach, and the club\\'s first since 1956â57. With Real\\'s Champions League victory, Zidane became only the second manager to win the European Cup in his first two seasons in management, alongside fellow Real Madrid manager JosÃ© Villalonga.\\n\\nHe later won the 2017 UEFA Super Cup 2â1 against Manchester United on 8 August. This meant Zidane was the first manager to win two UEFA Super Cups in a row since Arrigo Sacchi\\'s Milan in 1990. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 1â3 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de EspaÃ±a. Three days later, Real won the second leg 2â0, 5â1 on aggregate, while ending Barcelona\\'s consecutive scoring record in \"El ClÃ¡sico\". This title tied Zidane with Vicente del Bosque as the third most successful Real Madrid manager with 7 titles, one short of Luis Molowny, but still 7 away from Miguel MuÃ±oz. This also meant, that at the time, Zidane had won as many titles in his managerial position in Real Madrid as games lost during his tenure. Zidane\\'s success saw him named Best FIFA Men\\'s Coach in 2017. In December 2017, Zidane won his eighth trophy as manager when Real defeated GrÃªmio in the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. On 26 May, Zidane won the Champions League for the third time in a row, beating Liverpool 3â1 in the final. He became one of three managers, alongside Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti, to win the European Cup three times, while also becoming the first manager to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons.\\n\\nOn 31 May, five days after the Champions League Final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club\\'s \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.\\n\\nSection::::Return to Real Madrid.\\nFollowing some poor results for Real Madrid in the months following Zidane\\'s departure â culminating in elimination from the Copa del Rey\\'s semi-final stage at home to Barcelona, a league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4â1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week â his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui\\'s equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane returned as the Real Madrid head coach on 11 March 2019, on a contract until summer 2022.\\n\\nSection::::Reception and legacy.\\nMany authoritative voices have acclaimed Zidane\\'s skills and importance in the history of football, such as Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who called Zidane \"a monster\" for his performance and abilities. German coach Franz Beckenbauer stated, \"Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player.\" Italy manager Marcello Lippi, who also coached Zidane, opined, \"I think Zidane is the greatest talent we\\'ve known in football these last twenty years.\" Former England manager Kevin Keegan said, \"You look at Zidane and think \\'I\\'ve never seen a player quite like that.\\' What sets Zidane apart is the way he manipulates a football, buying himself space that isn\\'t there. Add his vision and it makes him very special.\" At the 1998 World Cup, Italian manager Cesare Maldini said, \"I would give up five players to have Zidane in my squad.\"\\n\\nAmong his playing peers, Swedish striker Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ commented, \"Zidane was from another planet. When Zidane stepped onto the pitch, the ten other guys just got suddenly better. It is that simple.\" David Beckham has described Zidane as \"the greatest of all time\", Barcelona star Xavi has stated in a 2010 interview that Zidane was \"best player in the \\'90s and early 2000s\", while Brazilian defender and former Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos has said of Zidane, \"He is the best player I\\'ve seen. Supporters arrived earlier at the BernabÃ©u just to see him warm-up.\" Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho stated, \"Zidane is one of the best footballers of all time, one of my idols. He had such elegance and grace, a wonderful touch and superb vision.\" Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard regards Zidane as \"the best ever\", and growing up he learned from his idol by \"watching him on television and online for hours.\"\\n\\nDisplaying skills with an array of moves such as his signature \"La Roulette\" pirouette, step overs and close ball control, former Brazilian international Rivaldo enjoyed watching Zidane more than any other player, stating, \"His elegance of movement on the pitch and his skills are uncanny.\" Journalist Sid Lowe wrote, \"Zidane was football\\'s answer to the Bolshoi Ballet. Zidane was elegance above all else.\" Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso opined, \"What he could do with a football is a dream for most of us.\" In 2005, upon Zidane\\'s return to the French national team, his teammate Thierry Henry stated, \"In France, everybody realized that God exists, and that he is back in the French international team.\" Zidane has been lauded by sportsmen outside football; having witnessed Zidane\\'s goal against Deportivo La CoruÃ±a in January 2002, where he dragged the ball right then left, turning the defender inside out, before scoring with a left foot finish, basketball player Magic Johnson stated, \"One of the most inspiring nights of my life. Zidane is a phenomenon.\"\\n\\nZidane has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times, a feat achieved only by Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. In 2002, ESPN described Zidane as \"the greatest player in the world in the world\\'s biggest game\". In a 2002 FIFA poll, Zidane was selected in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team. In 2004, he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years, and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world\\'s greatest living players. In 2011, when UEFA polled players, journalists and their users to crown the best player in the UEFA Champions League of the past 20 years, Zidane topped the vote. In a 2004 poll conducted by French newspaper \"Journal du Dimanche\", Zidane was voted as \"the most popular Frenchman of all time\". In 2014, in a poll carried out by French TV channel TF1, Zidane was voted as the best player in the history of the French league. In 2016, in a study led by French newspaper \"Le Parisien\", Zidane was named \"best French player of all time\".\\n\\nSection::::Reception as manager.\\nDespite establishing himself as one of the most successful managers of his era and in the history of Real Madrid, Zidane\\'s time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck. However, Zidane\\'s tactical philosophy, particularly his tactical flexibility, has been praised by many. His use of in-game substitutions was particularly praised, as many of his substitutes led to victories, such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas VÃ¡zquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1â0 deficit into a 3â1 victory. His introduction of Gareth Bale for similar reasons in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final also reaped similar rewards. It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks, while he is credited for popularising the 4â4â2 diamond formation in contemporary football.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some consider that Zidane\\'s role was more focused in grinding out results and uniting the dressing room, rather than having a fixed tactic scheme. Zidane emphasised the importance of players\\' physical levels and preferred to choose impactful players over a defined system.\\n\\nSection::::In popular culture.\\nZidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior. These sponsorship deals earned him â¬8.6\\xa0million on top of his â¬6.4\\xa0million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling â¬15\\xa0million ($20.4\\xa0million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer. In 2004, \"Forbes\" magazine listed his earnings of $15.8\\xa0million for the previous 12 months. In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with PelÃ© and Diego Maradona.\\n\\nIn 2005, filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary \"\", which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras. Scottish post-rock band Mogwai provided the soundtrack. The documentary was part of the 2009 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Zidane toured Bangladesh as the guest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. He also visited the Algerian birthplace of his parents and met with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who gave him an official reception. In 2012, Algerian artist Adel Abdessemed unveiled a bronze sculpture depicting Zidane\\'s headbutt of Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup Final.\\n\\nOn 5 November 2006, Zidane appeared in the American animated sitcom \"Family Guy\", seen headbutting an old lady in the episode \"Saving Private Brian\" as a parody of his headbutt on Materazzi. The infamous headbutt has also been the subject of a lyrical essay by the Belgian novelist Jean-Philippe Toussaint entitled \"La MÃ©lancolie de Zidane\" (2006).\\n\\nIn 2010, footage of Zidane appeared in the \"Waka Waka\" music video by Shakira, which shows him celebrating France winning the 1998 World Cup. In 2014, Australian sports presenter Les Murray collaborated with the band Vaudeville Smash and performed a Zidane tribute song, the accompanying video featuring four footballers performing ball tricks in Zidane masks, one of whom ends up headbutting a nightwatchman. In 2016, Zidane was ranked one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre of Jordan, which noted: \"[Zidane\\'s] modest character has endeared him to the wider public.\"\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nAt the age of 17, Zidane met his future wife, VÃ©ronique FernÃ¡ndez (born in Aveyron of Spanish descent), while playing for Cannes in the 1988â89 season. Married in 1994, they have four sons: Enzo Alan Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 24 March 1995), Luca Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 13 May 1998), Theo Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 18 May 2002), and Elyaz Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 26 December 2005).

As other chapels opened, however, there was a gradual decline in attendees and in 1933 the pastorâs salary was reduced by Â£20 to Â£205 (). In 1965 the chapel merged with the Zion Chapel and Rook Lane eventually closed in 1968. It was sold to developers but they were unable to secure planning permission for proposed future uses.

Like most other operators in C++, it can be overloaded.\\n\\nThe copy assignment operator, often just called the \"assignment operator\", is a special case of assignment operator where the source (right-hand side) and destination (left-hand side) are of the same class type. It is one of the special member functions, which means that a default version of it is generated automatically by the compiler if the programmer does not declare one. The default version performs a memberwise copy, where each member is copied by its own copy assignment operator (which may also be programmer-declared or compiler-generated).\\n\\nThe copy assignment operator differs from the copy constructor in that it must clean up the data members of the assignment\\'s target (and correctly handle self-assignment) whereas the copy constructor assigns values to uninitialized data members. For example:\\n\\nSection::::Return value of overloaded assignment operator.\\nThe language permits an overloaded assignment operator to have an arbitrary return type (including codice_2). However, the operator is usually defined to return a reference to the assignee. This is consistent with the behavior of assignment operator for built-in types (returning the assigned value) and allows for using the operator invocation as an expression, for instance in control statements or in chained assignment. Also, the C++ Standard Library requires this behavior for some user-supplied types.\\n\\nSection::::Overloading copy assignment operator.\\nWhen deep copies of objects have to be made, exception safety should be taken into consideration. One way to achieve this when resource deallocation never fails is:\\n\\n\\nHowever, if a no-fail (no-throw) swap function is available for all the member subobjects and the class provides a copy constructor and destructor (which it should do according to the rule of three), the most straightforward way to implement copy assignment is as follows:\\n\\nSection::::Assignment between different classes.\\nC++ supports assignment between different classes, both via implicit copy constructor and assignment operator, if the destination instance class is the ancestor of the source instance class:\\n\\nCopying from ancestor to descendant objects, which could leave descendant\\'s fields uninitialized, is not permitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Assignment operator (C++)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7789356'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '3QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7793545', 'text': 'Diane Coyle\\n\\nDiane Coyle, (born February 1961) is an economist and a former advisor to the UK Treasury.

In 1979 the public school board (6 of 7 members of which sent their children to Southland) declared many of the district\\'s buses, books and materials to be \"surplus\", then sold them to Southland at low prices. The effect of this caused financial hardships for the public schools, thereby promoting the academy. The first classes began in the old Anthony School building on Anthony Drive. In 1970, Southland moved to its current location at 123 Southland Road. It was reported in 1979 that most white parents in the area sent their children to Southland rather than the local public school system, which at the time was 80% black and the subject of boycotts and criticism over alleged neglect and underfunding. One businessman said he would \"dig ditches\" to earn money to pay tuition at Southland Academy and avoid sending his children to racially integrated public school.\\n\\nAs of the mid 1980s, the Sumter County School District board was all white.

He was both the first African American and first person from the Deep South to hold the position. A member of the Democratic Party, Espy previously served as the U.S. Representative for Mississippi\\'s 2nd congressional district from 1987 to 1993.\\n\\nIn March 2018, Espy announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Thad Cochran. Espy finished second in the November 6 nonpartisan special election before facing Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith in a November 27 runoff. Espy was defeated by Hyde-Smith, but garnered more than 46 percent of the vote in what was the closest U.S. Senate election in Mississippi since 1988.\\n\\nOn November 30, 2018, Espy filed to run against Hyde-Smith again in a 2020 rematch for a full six-year Senate term. \\n\\nSection::::Early life and education.\\nEspy was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi. He is the grandson of Thomas J. Huddleston Sr., founder of the Afro-American Sons and Daughters, a fraternal society that operated the Afro-American Hospital, a leading provider of health care for blacks in the state from the 1920s to the 1970s. Espy attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., and was active in student politics, holding several elective positions. He earned his Juris Doctor from Santa Clara University School of Law in California in 1978.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSection::::Early years.\\nEspy was an attorney with Central Mississippi Legal Services between 1978 and 1980 and was later the Assistant Secretary of State to Mississippi Legal Services. From 1980 to 1984, he was the Assistant Secretary of the State to the Public Lands Division.\\n\\nEspy was an Assistant State Attorney General from 1984 to 1985.\\n\\nSection::::Congress and Secretary of Agriculture.\\nIn November 1986, Espy was elected as a Democrat to the 100th Congress from . He defeated two-term Republican Webb Franklin to become the first African-American to represent Mississippi at the federal level since Reconstruction. He was reelected three times.\\n\\nIn December 1992, Espy was chosen by President-elect Bill Clinton to be the Secretary of Agriculture in the new administration. Following his confirmation by the Senate in late January 1993, Espy resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives.\\n\\nEspy served as Secretary of Agriculture from 1993 to 1994. He announced his resignation in October 1994, following questions from the White House over his use of government perks and acceptance of gifts. He was indicted in 1997 for receiving improper gifts, but acquitted of all 30 charges in 1998.\\n\\nIn October 2007, Espy crossed party lines to endorse Republican Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour\\'s reelection campaign.\\n\\nSection::::Private law career.\\nIn 2008, Espy became an attorney at Morgan & Morgan, a nationwide law firm, where he handles general plaintiff\\'s law, mass tort, bond and governmental finance, and international relations cases. One of his notable cases was the Pigford lawsuit, where Espy worked in conjunction with a black farmers advocacy group, the National Black Farmers Association, to represent those farmers.\\n\\nSection::::Senate campaigns.\\nSection::::2018.\\nOn March 5, 2018, Republican Senator Thad Cochran announced he would resign as of April 1 for health reasons, triggering a special election. Espy announced his intention to run for the seat that same day, becoming the first declared candidate in the race. He called Cochran \"a person I admire and respect, and who has done so much for Mississippi over his tenure.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, CBS described Espy as a conservative Democrat. He has identified his positions as moderate, making a centrist pitch for his Senate campaign. \"The Clarion Ledger\" wrote that Espy sought to \"play up his bipartisan credentials, like endorsing former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour. Steer the conversation away from anything controversial, even race, and back to health care.\" When asked by MSNBC\\'s Chris Matthews to comment on President Trump\\'s criticism of several African-American journalists, Espy \"refused to bite\", instead redirecting the interview to health care.\\n\\nA nonpartisan special election took place on November 6, 2018, the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Roger Wicker, who was running for reelection. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot. After no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff election between Espy and Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith was held on November 27. Espy lost the runoff with 46% of the vote.\\n\\nSection::::2020.\\nThree days after losing the Senate special election runoff to Hyde-Smith, on November 30, 2018, his 65th birthday, Espy filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the seat again in 2020.\\n\\nSection::::Political positions.\\nSection::::Economy.\\n\"National Journal\" noted that his liberal social views are mixed with his support for cutting the federal budget and protecting Mississippi\\'s defense and agricultural industries. In 2018, Espy said that he wanted to cut the government\\'s budget and that he supports free trade. He said he probably would have voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 but that he wants to \"make sure people see the benefits\".\\n\\nSection::::Guns.\\nHe supports gun ownership and received the National Rifle Association\\'s (NRA) Silver Rifle award in 1988 for supporting its positions on gun laws. In 2018, the NRA endorsed Espy\\'s opponent, Cindy Hyde-Smith, for the U.S. Senate, and did not give Espy a rating.\\n\\nSection::::Health care.\\nEspy believes that the decision by Republicans to deny an expansion of Medicaid is why so many rural hospitals in Mississippi have closed.\\n\\nSection::::Immigration.\\nEspy opposes a border wall, citing cost concerns. He opposes the Trump administration\\'s family separation policy.\\n\\nSection::::Social issues.\\nIn 1986, running for Congress, Espy was considered pro-choice on abortion. In 2018, he said he was moderate on abortion; he supports \"Roe v. Wade\" but opposes abortion personally. Espy said during his Senate campaign that he would work with anyone regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.\\n\\nSection::::Corruption trial and acquittal.\\nSection::::Espy trial.\\nOn August 27, 1997, Espy was indicted on charges of receiving improper gifts, including sports tickets, lodging, and airfare. Espy refused to plea bargain and on December 2, 1998, he was acquitted of all 30 criminal charges in the trial. Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz presented more than 70 witnesses during the trial and spent more than $20\\xa0million preparing and trying the case.\\n\\nDuring testimony before the jury, the prosecution\\'s star witness told Smaltz: \"God knows, if I had $30\\xa0million, I could find dirt on you, sir.\" During the trial, Smaltz protested that the defense was injecting race into the trial in what he saw as an appeal to a mostly black jury.\\n\\nThe defense rested without calling any witnesses, arguing simply that the prosecution had not proved its case. The jury deliberated less than 10 hours before finding Espy not guilty on all charges. One of the jurors said, \"This was the weakest, most bogus thing I ever saw. I can\\'t believe Mr. Smaltz ever brought this to trial.\" At least four other jurors echoed this view, though less pointedly. Barbara Bisoni, the only white juror, said Smaltz\\'s case \"had holes\" and that race never entered into the deliberations.\\n\\nSection::::Related cases.\\nIn 1996, Sun-Diamond Growers was fined $1.5\\xa0million for giving Espy $6,000 in gifts; in March 1998 it won a reversal at the Court of Appeals level. Independent Counsel Smaltz appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, finding that the gratuities statute requires a link between a gift and an official act. Unable to make such a link, Smaltz dismissed the gratuities charge against Sun-Diamond. The court\\'s unanimous April 1999 opinion, by Justice Antonin Scalia, stated that the prosecutor\\'s interpretation of the law was so broad that even a high school principal could be in legal trouble for giving a souvenir baseball cap to a visiting Secretary of Education. The Sun-Diamond decision played a pivotal role in Espy\\'s later acquittal because Smaltz was unable to link gifts he received to any official act.\\n\\nIn a separate case during the same investigation, Espy\\'s Chief of Staff, Ronald Blackley, was convicted in late 1997 on three counts of making false statements and sentenced to 27 months in prison.\\n\\nControversy also arose in 1994 from a White House discovery that a foundation run by Tyson Foods had given Espy\\'s then girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, a $1,200 scholarship. Espy and his lawyer admitted that they deceived the White House, which at first accepted Espy\\'s false claim that he was unaware of the scholarship before it was given to Dempsey. Administration officials said that the discovery of this scholarship was what forced Espy to resign as Secretary of Agriculture. In December 1997, Tyson Foods pleaded guilty to felony charges of giving Espy gifts.\\n\\nSection::::Early life, education, and personal life.\\nEspy was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, on November 30, 1953. He has a twin sister and five older siblings. He graduated from Yazoo City High School, where he served as senior class president. Espy received a B.A. in political science from Howard University and a J.D. from Santa Clara University School of Law. He married Sheila Bell, with whom he had two children before they divorced.

The project was discussed since 1987. The constructed new transmission lines connect 37\\xa0million consumers in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. It is expected to be completed in April 2013. There is controversy about the benefits and indirect environmental impacts of the project.\\n\\nSection::::Technical description.\\nSIEPAC network includes a 230\\xa0kV transmission line with a capacity of 300\\xa0MW between Guatemala and Panama, as well as improvements to existing systems. At the second stage the capacity will be increased up to 600\\xa0MW. SIEPAC cost about US$320\\xa0million without the proposed interconnections with Mexico (US$ 40M), Belize (US$ 30M) and Panama (US$ 200m). and, back in 2003, was scheduled for completion in 2006.\\n\\nSection::::Expected benefits.\\nProponents of SIEPAC expect that interconnecting the nations' electrical transmission grids will alleviate periodic power shortages in the region, reduce operating costs, optimize shared use of hydroelectric power, create a competitive energy market in the region, and attract foreign investment in power generation and transmission systems. It has been claimed that the cost of energy for consumers could go down as much as 20% from US$0.11 per kWh to US$0.09 per kWh as a result of the project. A feasibility study undertaken in 1995 by Power Technologies Inc. outlined various scenarios for the expansion of power demand and supply in the region and associated investments. The median scenario foresaw that SIEPAC would induce annual investments of US$700m over a 10-year period once the regional electricity market had begun operating.\\n\\nSection::::Ownership and regulation.\\nSIEPAC is owned by a Regional Operations Entity (Empresa Proprietaria de la Red - EPR), created in 1999 with registration in Panama, and comprising the public utilities and transmission companies of the six participating countries (75%) and private capital (25%). In some countries integrated utilities are shareholders - ENEE of Honduras, ICE and CNFL of Costa Rica - while in others shares are held by transmission companies - INDE of Guatemala, ETESA of Panama, and ENTE of Nicaragua. In the case of El Salvador the utility CEL and the transmission company ETESAL own the shares jointly. The private shareholders are Endesa of Spain and ISA from Colombia.\\n\\nThe establishment of a regional electricity regulator has been envisaged. While the IDB had suggested that electricity generating companies should not be allowed to hold shares in the transmission company, this has apparently been accepted by the governments of Central America.\\n\\nThe project is currently managed by a unit under the Central American Electrification Council (Consejo de ElectrificaciÃ³n de AmÃ©rica Central - CEAC).\\n\\nSection::::Financing.\\nThe funding for the project was originally expected to come from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), having initially pledged $170 million in hard and soft loans to the six Central American countries, the Spanish government, offering $70 million and the Central American nations. The contributions of the Central American nations had been initially estimated at up to US$106 million. However, it turned out that they will rather provide around US$35 million in-kind contributions, such as land and existing facilities. It had also been reported that Endesa would contribute 20% of the project costs through equity, an amount that was later reduced. Subsequently the IDB had to increase its exposure to US$240 million and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CBEI) was called in to provide additional support through three loans totaling US$90 million. The Colombian firm ISA also joined EPR as a shareholder.\\n\\nMore than 90% of the rights of way for the line had been acquired by May 2007. It is expected that the project can benefit from carbon finance under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.\\n\\nSection::::Criticism.\\nCritics have argued that the project will not make electricity cheaper for consumers in Central America, but may actually increase tariffs. Some critics also argue that SIEPAC will facilitate electricity exports to Mexico and not contribute to expand access in Central America. It is also argued that much of the increased generation capacity facilitated by SIEPAC would be in the form of large hydropower with associated social and environmental costs. Also, there are fears that the dominance of the power sector in Central America by large foreign corporations would be increased. Finally, there are some environmental concerns related to the transmission line itself. The initial Environmental Impact Assessment financed by the IDB analyzed only the direct impacts of the transmission line and not its indirect impacts from induced power generation.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'SIEPAC', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7802225'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7803034', 'text': 'Pilar Partido\\n\\nPilar Partido is a partido in the northern part of Greater Buenos Aires in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.\\n\\nThe provincial subdivision has a population of about 232,000 inhabitants in an area of , and its capital city is Pilar, which is around from Buenos Aires.\\n\\nIt has universities and schools.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Pilar Partido', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7803034'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5gE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7803940', 'text': 'Pinamar Partido\\n\\nPinamar Partido is a small partido on the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina.\\n\\nThe provincial subdivision has a population of about 20,000 inhabitants in an area of , and its capital city is Pinamar, which is around from Buenos Aires.\\n\\nUntil 1978 Pinamar was part of General Madariaga Partido.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nThe economy of Pinamar Partido is dominated by the summer tourist season (DecemberâFebruary), which sees hundreds of thousands of PorteÃ±os make their way to the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province.

During that time, Indian Medical Service was being heavily manned by the British. In 1940, Martin Melvin Curickshank of the Indian Medical Service (IMS) was appointed Medical Superintendent of Irwin Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of New Delhi. He was appointed specifically to establish a medical college complex near Ramlila Maidan. But before his plans could come to fruition, the Second World War started in 1939 and the plan of a new medical college had to be dropped. \\n\\nDuring the Second World War, some barracks were rapidly constructed near Safdarjung\\'s tomb to establish a medical centre for American troops fighting in this region. That hospital was well equipped, with x-ray machine, a laboratory, and other facilities for various emergency procedures. After the Second World War was over, America handed over the hospital to Indian government and it is now known as Safdarjung Hospital. Later a medical college was started there by Central Government Health Scheme of the Health Ministry.\\n\\nMAMC made a very humble beginning in 1958 at the erstwhile Irwin hospital (now the Lok Nayak Jay Prakash Hospital).

It caters to 290 undergradtuate students, 245 post graduate and post doctoral students per year being trained by 426 faculty members and 810 resident doctors. \\n\\nThe medical college offers MBBS and MD and MS degrees and postgraduate residency courses for super-speciality / sub-specialty fellowship degrees of MCh and DM. Institutes offering degrees in nursing and pharmacy are also attached to the college.\\n\\nSection::::Ranking.\\nMAMC was ranked fourth among medical colleges in India in 2017 by \"India Today\" and \"The Week\", and 11 by \"Outlook India\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Heritage sites.\\nThe college was established at the 30 acre land of the old Central Jail which was no longer in use after establishment of Tihar Jail at far away Tihar village on fringe of Delhi.

Broom received 2,566 popular votes (0.08%), finishing a poor fifth behind Webster (6,994 votes, 0.22%), who had also been nominated by the Union Party of Georgia. Neither Webster nor Broom received any electoral votes.\\n\\nSection::::Congressional service.\\nBroom was elected as a candidate of the American Party to the Thirty-fourth Congress in 1854.

Ferdinand\\'s reign came to an end with the death of his wife in 1853, but he served as regent for his son and successor, King Pedro V, until 1855. He and Maria founded the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which would rule Portugal until 1910.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn \"Ferdinand August Franz Anton\" in Vienna, he was the eldest son of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his wife Princess Maria Antonia KohÃ¡ry de CsÃ¡brÃ¡g, heiress to the House of KohÃ¡ry. The younger Ferdinand grew up in several places: the family estates in modern-day Slovakia, the imperial court of Austria, and Germany. He was a nephew of King Leopold I of Belgium, and thus a first cousin to Leopold II of Belgium and Empress Carlota of Mexico, as well as Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert.\\n\\nIn 1826, his title changed from \"Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld\" to \"Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\", following the re-arrangement of the Saxon duchies.\\n\\nSection::::King of Portugal.\\nAccording to Portuguese law, the husband of a queen regnant could only be titled king after the birth of an heir from that marriage; this was the reason Maria II\\'s first husband, Auguste de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, never acquired the title of king. After the birth of their eldest son and heir, the future Pedro V of Portugal, Ferdinand was proclaimed King Dom Fernando II.\\n\\nAlthough it was Maria who reigned by right, the royal couple formed an effective team during their joint reign, with Ferdinand reigning by himself during his wife\\'s pregnancies.\\n\\nEventually, Maria II died as a result of the birth of their eleventh child, and Ferdinand II\\'s reign ended. However, he would assume the regency of Portugal from 1853 to 1855, during the minority of his son King Pedro V.\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nIn 1869 he rejected an offer to assume the throne of Spain.\\n\\nFerdinand was an intelligent and artistically minded man with modern and liberal ideas. He was adept at etching, pottery and painting aquarelles. He was the president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and the Arts, Lord Protector of the University of Coimbra and Grand-Master of the Rosicrucians.\\n\\nIn 1838, he acquired the former Hieronymite monastery of Our Lady of Pena, which had been built by King Manuel I in 1511 on the top of the hill above Sintra and had been left unoccupied since 1834, when the religious orders were suppressed in Portugal. The monastery consisted of the cloister and its outbuildings, the chapel, the sacristy and the bell tower, which today form the northern section of the Pena National Palace (the \"Old Palace\").\\n\\nFerdinand began by making repairs to the former monastery, which, according to the historical sources of that time, was in poor condition. He refurbished the whole of the upper floor, replacing the fourteen cells used by the monks with larger-sized rooms and covering them with the vaulted ceilings that can still be seen today. In 1843, the king decided to enlarge the palace by building a new wing (the New Palace) with even larger rooms (one of them being the Great Hall), ending in a circular tower next to the new kitchens. The building work was directed by the Baron von Eschwege, a wild architectural fantasy in an eclectic style full of symbolism that could be compared with the castle Neuschwanstein of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. The palace was built in such a way as to be visible from any point in the park, which consists of a forest and luxuriant gardens with over five hundred different species of trees originating from the four corners of the earth.\\n\\nFerdinand would spend his last years in this castle with his second wife, receiving the greatest artists of his time.\\n\\nSection::::Marriages and descendants.\\nIn 1836 Ferdinand married Maria II, Queen Regnant of Portugal, the daughter and heiress of the late King Pedro IV (and also Emperor Pedro I of Brazil). Eleven children were born to the royal couple before Maria died of complications due to childbirth in 1853. Ferdinand was destined to outlive eight of his eleven children. In late 1861, an attack of cholera or typhoid fever struck the royal family and Ferdinand suffered the tragedy of witnessing the death of three of his five surviving sons.\\n\\nLater in his life, Ferdinand married again in Lisbon on 10 June 1869 to actress Elisa Hensler (NeuchÃ¢tel, 22 May 1836 â Lisbon, CoraÃ§Ã£o de Jesus, 21 May 1929).

Many famous artists have performed there, notably Mariah Carey (whose 1993 top-rated Thanksgiving special was taped there), Britney Spears, Hal Holbrook, Ted Wiles, and George Burns, as well as many others. It has one of the largest movie screens in the Northeast.\\n\\nThe theatre was opened on December 27, 1926. It was designed by architect Thomas Lamb. Four years later it hosted the first public demonstration of television. In 1979 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, shortly before being renovated after a long period of decline and neglect. A renovation completed in 2007 added two theatres to the complex, providing a variety of performance spaces.\\n\\nSection::::Building.\\nThe theater building is located on the south side of State Street (NY 5), in a densely developed commercial area. The exterior of the building and its interior arcade are included in the Register listing.\\n\\nIt is a three-story building with attic. The North (front) facade is faced in stucco, with engaged Doric pilasters. Ornamentation includes garlands and paterae on the friezes. A large marquee covers the sidewalk in front.\\n\\nInside, the arcade that connects the entrance to the theatre features space for (originally) 14 boutiques, with five copper-framed glass windows.

Gold leaf detail is all over the domed ceiling and entrance arches, in contrast to the black and silver damask wall coverings. The side loges are trimmed with iron grilles in the arches and heavy velvet drapes. Light is provided by a central black and gold chandelier with 192 lamps, flanked by six smaller fixtures.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe arrival of General Electric led to rapid growth in Schenectady through the late 19th and early 20th century. The city\\'s streetcar network made its downtown more accessible to the city. The vaudeville impresario Frederick Freeman Proctor chose to build his first theater in 1912. In the last years of his life, he decided to replace it. It cost $1.5 million ($ in contemporary dollars) to build and opened on December 27, 1926, with a showing of the silent film \"Stranded in Paris\". The audience was so impressed by the lavish facilities that no one complained about the malfunctioning Wurlitzer organ.\\n\\nProctor had sound equipment installed two years later for the new sound films. Shortly before his death in 1929, Proctor sold his theater chain to RKO Pictures. The next year it was the site of the first public demonstration of television, when an orchestra performed under the direction of the image of a conductor in General Electric Research Laboratory approx 3 miles away.\\n\\nThe theatre had fallen into disrepair throughout the 1960s and \\'70s while population shifted and moved out of Schenectady. The theatre was going to be torn down for use of the plot as a parking lot until a group of activists joined together and created the Arts Districts of Schenectady.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2007, Proctors finished a $24.5 million expansion. Several local firms were involved, including Stracher Roth Gilmore (architectural), Ryan-Biggs Associates (structural), M/E Engineering (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) and Adirondack Scenic (theatrical & rigging designers). The renovation added two theatres, making three separate theatre venues available for the public:\\n\\nIn September 2007, upon completion of the expansion project, Proctor\\'s Theatre changed its name to \"Proctors\" to reflect its three theatres.\\n\\nOn July 18, 2009, the theatre won the Outstanding Historic Theatre Award, presented by the League of Historic American Theatres at their annual meeting in Cleveland.

As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation. Without consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers. The consumer also forms part of the chain of distribution.\\n\\nRecently in marketing instead of marketers generating broad demographic profiles and Fisio-graphic profiles of market segments, marketers have started to engage in personalized marketing, permission marketing, and mass customization.\\n\\nLargely due to the rise of the Internet, consumers are shifting more and more towards becoming \"prosumers\", consumers who are also producers (often of information and media on the social web), influence the products created (e.g. by customization, crowdfunding or publishing their preferences), actively participate in the production process, or use interactive products.\\n\\nSection::::Law and politics.\\nThe law primarily uses a notion of the consumer in relation to consumer protection laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users. A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business. As all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection has a clear political significance.\\n\\nConcern over the interests of consumers has spawned consumer activism, where organized activists do research, education and advocacy to improve the offer of products and services. Consumer education has been incorporated into some school curricula. There are also various non-profit publications, such as \"Which?\", \"Consumer Reports\" and \"Choice Magazine\", dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making.\\n\\nIn India, the Consumer Protection Act 1986 differentiates the consummation of a commodity or service for personal use or to earn a livelihood.

He used his full name in his engineering career and Nevil Shute as his pen name to protect his engineering career from any potential negative publicity in connection with his novels, which included \"On the Beach\" and \"A Town Like Alice\".\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn in Somerset Road, Ealing, Middlesex, he was educated at the Dragon School, Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford; he graduated from Oxford University in 1922 with a third-class degree in engineering science. Shute\\'s father, Arthur Hamilton Norway, became head of the Post Office in Ireland before the First World War and was based at the main post office in Dublin in 1916 at the time of the Easter Rising. Shute himself was later commended for his role as a stretcher-bearer during the rising. On 13 June 1915 his elder brother, Fredrick Hamilton Norway, aged 19, was wounded at Epinette, near ArmentiÃ¨res, and was evacuated to Wimereux where he died, on 4 July, with his parents by his side. He was buried at Wimereux Communal Cemetery, Pas-de-Calais.\\n\\nShute attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, but because of his stammer was unable to take up a commission in the Royal Flying Corps, instead serving in the Great War as a soldier in the Suffolk Regiment.\\n\\nSection::::Career in aviation.\\nAn aeronautical engineer as well as a pilot, he began his engineering career with the De Havilland Aircraft Company. (He used his pen-name as an author to protect his engineering career from any potential negative publicity in connection with his novels.)\\n\\nDissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for advancement, he took a position in 1924 with Vickers Ltd., where he was involved with the development of airships, working as Chief Calculator (stress engineer) on the R100 airship project for the Vickers subsidiary Airship Guarantee Company. In 1929 he was promoted to Deputy Chief Engineer of the R100 project under Barnes Wallis and when Wallis left the project he became the Chief Engineer.\\n\\nThe R100 was a prototype for passenger-carrying airships that would serve the needs of Britain\\'s empire. The government-funded but privately developed R100 made a successful 1930 round trip to Canada. While in Canada it made trips from Montreal to Ottawa, Toronto and Niagara Falls. The fatal 1930 crash in France of its government-developed counterpart R101 ended British interest in dirigibles. The Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson, was killed in the crash along with several senior figures in the airship development program. The R100 was immediately grounded and subsequently scrapped. Shute gives a detailed account of the development of the two airships in his 1954 autobiographical work, \"\". His account is very critical of the R101 design and management team, and strongly hints that senior team members were complicit in concealing flaws in the airship\\'s design and construction. In \"The Tender Ship,\" Manhattan Project engineer and Virginia Tech professor Arthur Squires used Shute\\'s account of the R100 and R101 as a primary illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.\\n\\nIn 1931, with the cancellation of the R100 project, Shute teamed up with the talented de Havilland trained designer A. Hessell Tiltman to found the aircraft construction company Airspeed Ltd.\\n\\nA site was available in a former trolleybus garage on Piccadilly, York. Despite setbacks, including the usual problems of a new business, Airspeed Limited eventually gained recognition when its Envoy aircraft was chosen for the King\\'s Flight. With the approach of war, a military version of the Envoy was developed, to be called the Airspeed Oxford. The Oxford became the standard advanced multi-engined trainer for the RAF and British Commonwealth, with over 8,500 being built.\\n\\nFor the innovation of developing a hydraulic retractable undercarriage for the Airspeed Courier, and his work on R100, Shute was made a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.\\n\\nOn 7 March 1931, Shute married Frances Mary Heaton, a 28-year-old medical practitioner. They had two daughters, Heather and Shirley.\\n\\nSection::::Second World War.\\nBy the outbreak of the Second World War, Shute was already a rising novelist. Even as war seemed imminent he was working on military projects with his former boss at Vickers, Sir Dennistoun Burney. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant and quickly ended up in what would become the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. There he was a head of engineering, working on secret weapons such as Panjandrum, a job that appealed to the engineer in him. He also developed the Rocket Spear, an anti-submarine missile with a fluted cast iron head. After the first U-boat was sunk by it, Charles Goodeve sent him a message concluding \"I am particularly pleased as it fully substantiates the foresight you showed in pushing this in its early stages. My congratulations.\"\\n\\nHis celebrity as a writer caused the Ministry of Information to send him to the Normandy Landings on 6 June 1944 and later to Burma as a correspondent. He finished the war with the rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserves (RNVR).\\n\\nSection::::Literary career.\\nShute\\'s first novel, \"Stephen Morris\", was written in 1923, but not published until 1961.\\n\\nHis first published novel was \"Marazan\", which came out in 1926. After that he averaged one novel every two years through the 1950s, with the exception of a six-year hiatus while he was establishing his own aircraft construction company, Airspeed Ltd. His popularity grew slowly with each novel, but he became much more famous after the publication of \"On the Beach\" in 1957.\\n\\nShute\\'s novels are written in a simple, highly readable style, with clearly delineated plot lines. Where there is a romantic element, sex is referred to only obliquely. Many of the stories are introduced by a narrator who is not a character in the story. The most common theme in Shute\\'s novels is the dignity of work, spanning all classes, whether an Eastern European bar \"hostess\" (\"Ruined City\") or brilliant boffin (\"No Highway\").\\n\\nAnother recurrent theme is the bridging of social barriers such as class (\"Lonely Road\" and \"Landfall\"), race (\"The Chequer Board\"), or religion (\"Round the Bend\"). The Australian novels are individual hymns to that country, with subtle disparagement of the mores of the United States (\"Beyond the Black Stump\") and overt antipathy towards the post-World War II socialist government of Shute\\'s native Britain (\"The Far Country\" and \"In the Wet\").\\n\\nShute\\'s heroes tended to be like himself: middle class solicitors, doctors, accountants, bank managers, engineers, generally university graduates. However (as in \"Trustee from the Toolroom\"), Shute valued the honest artisans and their social integrity and contributions to society more than the contributions of the upper classes.\\n\\nAviation and engineering provide the backdrop for many of Shute\\'s novels. He identified how engineering, science, and design could improve human life and more than once used the anonymous epigram, \"It has been said an engineer is a man who can do for five shillings what any fool can do for a pound.\"\\n\\nSeveral of Shute\\'s novels explored the boundary between accepted science and rational belief, on the one hand, and mystical or paranormal possibilities, including reincarnation, on the other hand. Shute did this by including elements of fantasy and science fiction in novels that were considered mainstream. They included Buddhist astrology and folk prophecy in \"The Chequer Board\"; the effective use of a Planchette in \"No Highway;\" a messiah figure in \"Round the Bend\"; reincarnation, science fiction, and Aboriginal psychic powers in \"In the Wet.\"\\n\\nTwenty-four of his novels and novellas have been published. Many of his books have been adapted for the screen, including \"Lonely Road\" in 1936; \"Landfall: A Channel Story\" in 1949; \"Pied Piper\" in 1942, 1959, and as \"Crossing to Freedom,\" a CBS made-for-television movie, in 1990; \"On the Beach\" in 1959 and in 2000 as a two-part miniseries; and \"No Highway\" in 1951. \"A Town Like Alice\" was adapted in 1956 and serialized for Australian television in 1981, and was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in 1997 starring Jason Connery, Becky Hindley, Bernard Hepton and Virginia McKenna. Shute\\'s 1952 novel \"The Far Country\" was filmed for television as six one-hour episodes in 1972, and as a two-part miniseries in 1987.\\n\\nVintage Books reprinted all 23 of his books in 2009.\\n\\nShute\\'s final work was published more than 40 years after his death. \"The Seafarers\" was first drafted in 1946â47, subsequently rewritten, and then put aside. In 1948, Shute again rewrote it, changing the title to \"Blind Understanding,\" but he left the manuscript incomplete. According to Dan Telfair in the foreword of the 2002 edition, some of the themes in \"The Seafarers\" and \"Blind Understanding\" were used in Shute\\'s 1955 novel \"Requiem for a Wren\".\\n\\nSection::::Activities after the war.\\nIn 1948, Shute flew his own Percival Proctor airplane to Australia and back, accompanied by the writer James Riddell, who published a book, \"Flight of Fancy,\" based on the trip, in 1950.\\n\\nOn his return, concerned about what he saw as the decline of his home country, he decided that he and his family would emigrate to Australia. In 1950, he settled with his wife and two daughters on farmland at Langwarrin, south-east of Melbourne. Remembering his 1930 trip to Canada and his decision to emigrate to Australia, he wrote, in 1954, \"For the first time in my life I saw how people live in an English-speaking country outside England.\" Although he intended to remain in Australia, he did not apply for Australian citizenship, which was at that time a mere formality because he was a British subject.\\n\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he was one of the world\\'s best-selling novelists, although his popularity has since declined in Australia.\\n\\nBetween 1956 and 1958 in Australia, he took up car racing as a hobby, driving a white Jaguar XK140. Some of this experience found its way into his book \"On the Beach \".\\n\\nShute died in Melbourne in 1960 after a stroke.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Honours.\\nNorway Road and Nevil Shute Road at Portsmouth Airport, Hampshire were both named after him. Shute Avenue in Berwick, Victoria was named after him, when the farm used for filming the 1959 film \"On The Beach\" was subdivided for housing.\\n\\nThe public library in Alice Springs, Northern Territory is the Nevil Shute Memorial Library.\\n\\nIn the Readers\\' List of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the 20th century, \"A Town Like Alice\" came in at number 17, \"Trustee from the Toolroom\" at 27, and \"On the Beach\" at 56.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Nevil Shute', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78191', 'cat_id': '78191', 'cat_title': 'Businesspeople_of_Indian_descent', 'cat_pages': '43', 'cat_subcats': '4', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '9wE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7820287', 'text': 'Cabidela\\n\\nCabidela () or arroz de cabidela (\"cabidela\" rice) is a Portuguese dish made with poultry or rabbit cooked in its own blood added to water and a bit of vinegar much like \"jugged\" or \"civet\" dishes.

The draft standard was ratified on 24 June 2004. This standard specifies security mechanisms for wireless networks, replacing the short \"Authentication and privacy\" clause of the original standard with a detailed \"Security\" clause. In the process, the amendment deprecated broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), while it was later incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.\\n\\nSection::::Replacement of WEP.\\n802.11i supersedes the previous security specification, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which was shown to have security vulnerabilities. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) had previously been introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as an intermediate solution to WEP insecurities. WPA implemented a subset of a draft of 802.11i. The Wi-Fi Alliance refers to their approved, interoperable implementation of the full 802.11i as WPA2, also called RSN (Robust Security Network). 802.11i makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, whereas WEP and WPA use the RC4 stream cipher.\\n\\nSection::::Protocol operation.\\nIEEE 802.11i enhances IEEE 802.11-1999 by providing a Robust Security Network (RSN) with two new protocols: the four-way handshake and the group key handshake. These utilize the authentication services and port access control described in IEEE 802.1X to establish and change the appropriate cryptographic keys. The RSN is a security network that only allows the creation of robust security network associations (RSNAs), which are a type of association used by a pair of stations (STAs) if the procedure to establish authentication or association between them includes the 4-Way Handshake. \\n\\nThe standard also provides two RSNA data confidentiality and integrity protocols, TKIP and CCMP, with implementation of CCMP being mandatory since the confidentiality and integrity mechanisms of TKIP are not as robust as those of CCMP. The main purpose to implement TKIP was that the algorithm should be implementable within the capabilities of most of the old devices supporting only WEP.\\n\\nThe initial authentication process is carried out either using a pre-shared key (PSK), or following an EAP exchange through 802.1X (known as EAPOL, which requires the presence of an authentication server). This process ensures that the client station (STA) is authenticated with the access point (AP). After the PSK or 802.1X authentication, a shared secret key is generated, called the Pairwise Master Key (PMK). The PMK is derived from a password that is put through PBKDF2-SHA1 as the cryptographic hash function. In a pre-shared-key network, the PMK is actually the PSK. If an 802.1X EAP exchange was carried out, the PMK is derived from the EAP parameters provided by the authentication server.\\n\\nSection::::Four-way handshake.\\nThe four-way handshake is designed so that the access point (or authenticator) and wireless client (or supplicant) can independently prove to each other that they know the PSK/PMK, without ever disclosing the key. Instead of disclosing the key, the access point (AP) and client encrypt messages to each otherâthat can only be decrypted by using the PMK that they already shareâand if decryption of the messages was successful, this proves knowledge of the PMK. The four-way handshake is critical for protection of the PMK from malicious access pointsâfor example, an attacker\\'s SSID impersonating a real access pointâso that the client never has to tell the access point its PMK. \\n\\nThe PMK is designed to last the entire session and should be exposed as little as possible; therefore, keys to encrypt the traffic need to be derived. A four-way handshake is used to establish another key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). The PTK is generated by concatenating the following attributes: PMK, AP nonce (ANonce), STA nonce (SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address. The product is then put through a pseudo-random function. The handshake also yields the GTK (Group Temporal Key), used to decrypt multicast and broadcast traffic. \\n\\nThe actual messages exchanged during the handshake are depicted in the figure and explained below (all messages are sent as EAPOL-Key frames):\\n\\nThe Pairwise Transient Key (64 bytes) is divided into five separate keys:\\n\\nThe Group Temporal Key (32 bytes) is divided into three separate keys:\\n\\nThe Michael MIC Authenticator Tx/Rx Keys in both the PTK and GTK are only used if the network is using TKIP to encrypt the data.\\n\\nThis four-way handshake has been shown to be vulnerable to KRACK.\\n\\nSection::::Group key handshake.\\nThe Group Temporal Key (GTK) used in the network may need to be updated due to the expiration of a preset timer. When a device leaves the network, the GTK also needs to be updated. This is to prevent the device from receiving any more multicast or broadcast messages from the AP.\\n\\nTo handle the updating, 802.11i defines a \"Group Key Handshake\" that consists of a two-way handshake:\\n\\nSection::::CCMP overview.\\nCCMP is based on the Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode of the AES encryption algorithm. CCM combines CTR for confidentiality and CBC-MAC for authentication and integrity. CCM protects the integrity of both the MPDU Data field and selected portions of the IEEE 802.11 MPDU header.\\n\\nSection::::Key hierarchy.\\nRSNA defines two key hierarchies:\\n\\n\\nThe description of the key hierarchies uses the following two functions:\\n\\n\\nThe pairwise key hierarchy utilizes PRF-384 or PRF-512 to derive session-specific keys from a PMK, generating a PTK, which gets partitioned into a KCK and a KEK plus all the temporal keys used by the MAC to protect unicast communication.\\n\\nThe GTK shall be a random number which also gets generated by using PRF-n, usually PRF-128 or PRF-256, in this model, the group key hierarchy takes a GMK (Group Master Key) and generates a GTK.\\n\\nSection::::MAC frame formats.\\nSection::::Protected Frame field.\\n\"The Protected Frame field is 1 bit in length. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 if the Frame Body field contains information that has been processed by a cryptographic encapsulation algorithm. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 only within data frames of type Data and within management frames of type Management, subtype Authentication. The Protected Frame field is set to 0 in all other frames. When the bit Protected Frame field is set to 1 in a data frame, the Frame Body field is protected utilizing the cryptographic encapsulation algorithm and expanded as defined in Clause 8. Only WEP is allowed as the cryptographic encapsulation algorithm for management frames of subtype Authentication.\"\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'IEEE 802.11i-2004', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783135', 'cat_id': '783135', 'cat_title': 'Museums_in_Richland_County,_Ohio', 'cat_pages': '4', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'AAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7834816', 'text': 'Saputo\\n\\nSaputo may refer to:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Saputo', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7834816'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'AQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7836038', 'text': \"John Chew\\n\\nJohn Chew Hiang Chea ; born 4 October 1947) was the third Metropolitan Archbishop and Primate of the Province of Anglican Church in South East Asia as well as Bishop of Singapore.

The audio quality of the second version is not as full sounding as the first. Thus, the second version must be a restored version. It is likely that the first version was the one released in the theaters in 1964.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nDuring the late 12th century, about 100 years after the Norman conquest (1066), the Normans have removed the native ruling class, replacing it with a new monarchy, aristocracy and clerical hierarchy.\\n\\nThomas Becket is a Saxon protÃ©gÃ© and facilitator to the carousing King Henry II, who transforms into a man who continually invokes the \"honour of God\". Henry appoints Becket Lord Chancellor to have a close confidant in this position whom he can completely control. Instead, Becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. Henry finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive, and is described as the \"perennial adolescent\" by the Bishop of London. Henry is more interested in escaping his duties through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. He is increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry\\'s court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry\\'s Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as the queen and Henry\\'s mother, who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage.\\n\\nHenry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property to support Henry\\'s military campaigns in France (\"Bishop, I must hire the Swiss Guards to fight for me â and no one has ever paid them off with principles!\"). During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives word that the old archbishop has \"gone to God\\'s bosom\". In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Becket sides with the Church, throwing Henry into a fury. One of the main bones of contention is Thomas\\' excommunication of Lord Gilbert, one of Henry\\'s most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. Gilbert then refused to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution.\\n\\nThe King has a dramatic secret meeting with the Bishop of London in his cathedral (\"I have the Archbishop on my stomach, a big hard lump\"). He lays out his plan to remove the troublesome cleric through scandal and innuendo, which the position-conscious Bishop of London quickly agrees to (thus furthering Henry\\'s already deep contempt for church higher-ups). These attempts fall flat when Becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers outside the rectory and routs them, causing Henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of it all; \"Becket is the only intelligent man in my entire kingdom ... and he is against me!\" Becket escapes to France where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic King Louis (John Gielgud). King Louis sees in Becket a means by which he can further his favourite pastime, tormenting the arrogant English. Becket gets to Rome, where he begs the Pope to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. The Vatican is a hotbed of intrigue and political jockeying. The Pope reminds Becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to England and take a stand against civil interference in Church matters. Becket yields to this decision and asks Louis to arrange a meeting with Henry on the beaches at Normandy. Henry asks Becket whether or not he loved him and Becket replied that he loved Henry to the best of his ability. A shaky truce is declared and Becket is allowed to return to England.\\n\\nThe remainder of the film shows Henry rapidly sinking into drunken fixation over Becket and his perceived betrayal. The barons worsen his mood by pointing out that Becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished Saxons, who are ever restive and resentful of their Norman conquerors. There are comical fights between Henry and his frumpy consort, Eleanor of Aquitaine, his dimwitted son/heir apparent, and his cold-blooded mother, who repeatedly reminds her son that his father would have quickly had someone like Becket done away with for the sake of the realm. During one of his drunken rages he asks \"Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\" His faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to Canterbury, where they put Thomas and his Saxon deputy, Brother John, to the sword. A badly shaken Henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of Saxon monks.\\n\\nHenry, fresh from his whipping, publicly proclaims that Thomas Becket is a saint and that the ones who killed him will be justly punished.\\n\\nSection::::Preservation.\\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Becket\" in 2003.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Historicity.\\nMost of the historical inaccuracies in the film are from the play, as Anouilh was writing drama rather than a history, and he took dramatic licence.\\n\\nThe major inaccuracy is the depiction of Becket as a Saxon who has risen to a perceived Norman social standing, when in fact the historical Thomas Becket was a Norman (while Henry was an Angevin). Anouilh did this because he had based the play on a 19th-century account that described Becket as a Saxon. He had been informed of this error before his play was produced, but decided against correcting it because it would undermine a key point of conflict, and because \"history might eventually rediscover that Becket was a Saxon, after all.\"\\n\\nBecket is depicted as Henry\\'s loyal \"drinking pal\", who aids him in illicit romantic entanglements, but who becomes saintly and responsible after his appointment as Archbishop. Passing mention is made in the film of the Constitutions of Clarendon (simply as the \"Sixteen Articles\"); the struggle between Becket and Henry is boiled down to their conflict over Lord Gilbert\\'s murder of the captive priest. In no way is Becket depicted as a man who desired special legal privileges (defrocking rather than prison) for his clergy, as some believe that he was.\\n\\nHenry\\'s mother, Empress Matilda, died in 1167, three years before the treaty of FrÃ©teval allowed Becket to return in England. Henry appears to not have any respect for his mother and treats her as something of an annoyance, a rather drastic departure from what is generally held as historical fact. Empress Matilda was Henry\\'s sole parent for much of his childhood, and she was instrumental in shaping Henry into the fierce warrior and skilled administrator he was. Far from seeing his mother as a burden, Henry seems to have adored Matilda and relied heavily on her advice and guidance until her death.\\n\\nHenry\\'s wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine was in fact beautiful, brilliant and superbly educated, famous for her wit, charm and daring.\\n\\nShe is shown publicly rebuking Henry in a scene near the end of the film, when in fact Eleanor, whatever private reservations she may have had, is not known to have ever behaved in such a manner in public. During the same scene, she says she will go to her father to complain of Henry\\'s treatment of her; however, her father had died decades before, when Eleanor was just 15 years old. It was her father\\'s death that made Eleanor the Duchess of Aquitaine and the most eligible bride of the 12th century, and Henry would not have married her had she not come with Aquitaine. When combined with Henry\\'s own duchies in France, the marriage gave the royal couple control over more land in France than the actual King of France possessed at the time. Also, the film shows Henry and Eleanor as having four children, all boys. In truth Henry and Eleanor had \"eight\" children, five sons and three daughters. While the eldest son, William, had died before the events of the film, the three daughters are neglected.\\n\\nSection::::Production financing.\\nThe film grossed $9,164,370 at the box office, earning $3 million in rentals.\\n\\nSection::::Awards and nominations.\\nThe film won an Academy Award and received eleven other nominations:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Becket (1964 film)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7837396'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7839260', 'text': 'Krasny, Krasninsky District, Smolensk Oblast\\n\\nKrasny () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Krasninsky District of Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Svinaya and the Mereya Rivers southwest of Smolensk. Population: \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nKrasny (originally Krasn or Krasen) is first mentioned in 1165 by the Hypatian Codex, when Davyd Rostislavich, Prince of Smolensk, gave Krasen to his nephew, Roman of Vitebsk. Between second half of the 14th century and the middle of the 17th century, the area belonged intermittently to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to Poland, and to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Since 1654, it was finally transferred to the Tsardom of Russia.\\n\\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Smolensk Governorate and remained there until 1929, with the exception of the brief period between 1775 and 1796, when Smolensk Governorate was transformed into Smolensk Viceroyalty. The area belonged to Krasninsky Uyezd, which was established in 1775. In 1776, Krasny was granted town status. In 1796, the uyezd was abolished but it was re-established in 1802. \\n\\nDuring the French invasion of Russia, Krasny played an important role, since the French army passed it twice en route to and from Russia. The battle in August 1812 was a lesser action of Murat\\'s advance guard against the small retreating Russian rearguard of Dmitry Neverovsky. The French ran into unexpectedly strong resistance from the Russians. In his Napoleonic history, de SÃ©gur wrote that Neverovsky retreated \"like a lion\".\\n\\nAt the Battle of Krasnoi in November 1812, the Russian army inflicted heavy losses on the remnants of the French Grande ArmÃ©e. There are two monuments in Krasny commemorating that event, both erected in 1912. \\n\\nOn 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Krasninsky District with the administrative center in Krasny was established. Krasny did not retain the town status during Soviet times. The district belonged to Smolensk Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Krasninsky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and 1943, during WWII, Krasny was occupied by German troops. On 1 February 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Krasninsky District was merged into Smolensky District, but in 1965 it was re-established.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nIndustry includes flax and dairy processing, vegetable processing, and manufacture of drainage pipes.\\n\\nSection::::Transportation.\\nKrasny has access to M1 \"Belarus\" Highway and is additionally connected by paved roads with Smolensk and with Orsha (so called Old Smolensk Road).\\n\\nSection::::Culture and recreation.\\nKrasny contains nine objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance.\\n\\nIn Krasny, there is a museum of local lore, whose three exhibits include materials on the Patriotic War of 1812, Great Patriotic War of 1941â1945, and on modern life at the settlement.\\n\\nOn September\\xa027, 2009, the \"Walk of Heroes\" history museum opened in Krasny.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Krasny, Krasninsky District, Smolensk Oblast', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7839260'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '783962', 'text': \"Raahe\\n\\nRaahe () is a town and municipality of Finland. Founded by Swedish statesman and Governor General of Finland Count Per Brahe the Younger in 1649, it is one of 10 historic wooden towns (or town centers) remaining in Finland. Examples of other Finnish historic wooden towns are Kaskinen (KaskÃ¶), Old Rauma, Porvoo (BorgÃ¥), Jakobstad (Pietarsaari), and Vaasa (Vasa). After a devastating fire in 1810, Raahe was rebuilt adhering to new design principles which minimized the risk of fire and enlarged some civic spaces. Old Raahe is noted for its Renaissance-inspired rectilinear town plan featuring an unusual central-square (called Pekkatori) with closed corners.\\n\\nRaahe is located on the northern shores of the Gulf of Bothnia in the region of North Ostrobothnia . The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Historically an agricultural and maritime region, Ostrobothnia supplied the largest number of immigrants from Finland to the US and other countries such as Canada and Australia during the great migration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\n\\nFounded as a Swedish-and-Finnish-speaking town, the municipality is now unilingually Finnish.\\n\\nThe asteroid 1786 Raahe was named after this town and municipality.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Seventeenth century history.\\nCount Per Brahe the Younger, the governor-general of Finland, gave a charter to the town of Salo in the year of 1649 with the purpose of constructing a town at Satamakangas, near the old harbour site. However, the harbour area had become so low that the future town was decided to be transferred. A new and better location was found further to the north, at the bay of Raahe. Having acquired the possession of the parish of Salo in 1652, Per Brahe renamed the town Brahestad or Raahe in Finnish.\\n\\nThe planning of the town for the purpose of building Raahe was given to the surveyor Claes Claesson. His town plan followed the ideals of the regular grid plan of the Renaissance. All of the streets of Raahe were of equal width of 20-21 cubits or 10â11 meters. The market square stood by Rantakatu and the Town Hall behind the square. At the northeast corner of the town stood the church and the schoolhouse. Six blocks were realized of the town plan, i.e. the area surrounded by present-day Koulukatu, Kirkkokatu, Saaristokatu and Rantakatu. The later expansion and changes of the town have held the ambitions of Claesson's town plan in respect until the beginning of the latest century.\\n\\nThe oldest picture still remaining of the town of Raahe, a seventeenth-century drawing, dates back to the year of 1659. It depicts the town as being surrounded by a so-called customs fence with two custom gates, the eastern one located outside of the crossroads of present-day Brahenkatu and Reiponkatu streets and the southern one at the end of PitkÃ¤katu street (present-day Kauppakatu street) approximately by present-day Koulukatu street. The busy harbour of the town was located on the shore by the customs warehouse, the present museum.\\n\\nThere were two public buildings in Raahe: a handsome, admirable, two-story town hall with a tower, and a wooden church, whose construction had already begun in 1651. The church was given a weather boarding already in 1684-1685. This is one of the earliest examples of boarding known in Finland.\\n\\nThe dwellings and houses were made from logs. As a rule, they were built close to the street facing plot boundary, the long side and the ridge of the roof parallel to the street. The unbuilt portion of the plot against the street was fitted up with a high, solid plank fence and a drive-in gate. The plots inside a block were not separated by fences. The average house usually consisted of one or two rooms, most of which were of the two-room cabin type. Almost every house in the drawing of Raahe has the most remarkable novelty of the seventeenth century, the chimney. At the same time it was still quite common to have whole towns and villages with chimneyless houses, especially in Eastern Finland. Considered from the point of view of architectural history, at the time of its foundation Raahe was a quite modern town. As far as is known today, no buildings exist from the seventeenth century.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nRaahe was granted Staple port rights in 1791 and was traditionally a harbor town. With industrialization, Raahe was reinvented as a steel and heavy industry city and has further developed with engineering services, ICT and software production. Raahe is known for steel, heavy machinery, engineering works, shipping and ICT. The Rautaruukki steel mill, which up to the 1980s was the largest single industrial site in the Nordic countries, is located in Raahe. The mill produces steel plate, coil and sheeting and semi-finished products for the engineering works.\\n\\nTraditionally, Raahe was a port city. In the late Age of Sail, the 1850s and on, shipping companies in Raahe owned Finland's largest fleet of sailing vessels, 60 in total at their height. Currently, the port of Raahe is the sixth busiest port in the country, with 700 ships visiting each year. Cargo that is transported through the port includes raw materials and loose cargo, steel, lumber, containers and contract-shipped goods.\\n\\nWith the steel industry, Raahe has grown into the third largest city in the ex-Oulu province, after Oulu and Kajaani. Like Oulu, the city promotes the ICT business, with the help of the steel industry (ProMetal and Steelpolis) and ICT industry (Softpolis) business incubators/business parks.\\n\\nThe municipal tax rate is 19.75%. In 2007, the structure of the economy was as follows: agriculture and forestry 1%, construction 6%, manufacturing 43%, and retail, services and public services 50%. The sub-region includes the municipalities of PyhÃ¤joki and Siikajoki.\\n\\nSection::::International relations.\\nSection::::Twin towns â Sister cities.\\nRaahe is twinned with:\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Raahe', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783962', 'cat_id': '783962', 'cat_title': 'Songs_written_by_Bob_Regan', 'cat_pages': '16', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7841321', 'text': 'Helene (name)\\n\\nHelene () is a female given name, a variant of Helen, using the French spelling.

Gladys was created and is maintained by artist/owner James Lebinski since August 2002. The underlying sculpture is a fiberglass Swiss dairy cow, and is the same shape and size as the famous CowParade cows.\\n\\nLebinski has created more than 50 pieces of art using the sculpture by decorating it with paint, cloth, and various other materials for each holiday. Gladys was displayed in Fairfield, Connecticut, from October 2002 until April 2006, and can currently be found in Monroe, Connecticut.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn July 2002, Lebinski recovered a fiberglass cow sculpture from a Dumpster in Norwalk, Connecticut. Lebinski repaired the sculpture\\'s smashed body and four broken legs and painted it pink. Gladys was placed on display in Fairfield, Connecticut in August 2002. The sculpture became an object of attention and resulted in suggestions to the artist to create whimsical seasonal designs using the sculpture as a base.\\n\\nSection::::Early development.\\nIn 2002, the first seasonal artwork using the sculpture was titled \"Gladys as a Skeleton\", and was created for Halloween. A significant amount of public attention was generated by this artwork, and this attention was the genesis of the ongoing project to create holiday-themed art. \\nThe next piece was created for Christmas 2002. The cow sculpture was painted as Santa Claus and the artwork was titled \"Gladys as Santa Cow\". These two works gained public attention and generated initial press coverage.\\n\\nSection::::2003.\\nThe ongoing creation of works based on the cow sculpture continued in 2003. \\nThe first work for the cow sculpture in 2003 was for Valentine\\'s Day and was titled \"Gladys as a Valentine\". Next, in March 2003, the cow sculpture was converted to \"Gladys as a Leprechaun\". The use of a single prop was in keeping with using paint as a primary medium.\\n\\nIn April 2003, the media used to create the art was expanded to include additional props and attachments.\\n\\nIn May 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as Uncle Sam\". The art was then incorporated into a parade float for the 2003 Fairfield Memorial Day Parade. This was the first large-scale public exhibition of the work. As a result, the work was awarded \"Best Appearing FloatâService Club\" by the 2003 Fairfield Memorial Day Parade Committee.\\n\\nIn July 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys in an Itsy-Bitsy Teenie-Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\". The use of props was expanded to include props that were not physically attached to the sculpture.\\nIn August 2003, the cow sculpture was converted to art with a first-day-of school motif. The work \"Gladys as a School Bus\" represented the first piece that was designed to closely resemble a real-life object, and was achieved in a paint-only medium.\\n\\nIn October 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as a Scarecrow\", inspired by The Wizard of Oz. This marked the first complete departure from the sculpture as a painted work. The use of straw, natural fiber, burlap, and organic materials was incorporated to achieve a fall motif. \\n\\nIn December 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into a Christmas theme: \"Gladys as a Reindeer\". This work was featured in a multi-page article in the \"Fairfield Citizen-News\".\\n\\nSection::::2004.\\nIn February 2004, the sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as a Valentine Bride\".\\n\\nIn March 2004, the cow sculpture was converted into a Saint Patrick\\'s Day work. The rainbow colors were true to the Roy G. Biv color spectrum of a rainbow. Ultimately, a pot of gold prop was added, along with a second piece of public art titled \"Sophie as a Leprechaun\" to clarify the \"pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow\" theme.\\n\\nFor Easter in April 2004, the sculpture was transformed into a work of art that featured an Easter bonnet prop, and multiple painted Easter eggs with individual images.\\n\\nIn May 2004, the Uncle Sam motif was re-created, representing the first time a work was repeated. The art was featured as an entry in the 2004 Fairfield Memorial Day Parade. The work was awarded \"honorable mention\" by the 2004 Fairfield Memorial Day Committee.\\n\\nIn August 2004, the cow sculpture was transformed into a tribute to the Fairfield Fire Department, Station 2. The work incorporated memorial logos for the Worcester 6, and 9/11 FDNY. The firefighters\\' union logo and Irish firefighter logo were also reproduced.\\n\\nIn October 2004, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as Dracula\". Additionally, an Ogden Nash poem was incorporated on a tombstone prop.\\n\\nIn December 2004, the cow sculpture was converted into a lighted Christmas tree. The use of additional props was expanded to incorporate day-visible ornaments, presents, and a Christmas tree, as well as night-visible multicolored lights.\\n\\nSection::::2005.\\nIn January 2005, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as a Mardi Gras Jester\".\\n\\nIn April 2005, the cow sculpture, was designed in a Spring/Easter scheme and represented the first use of a sponge painting technique to achieve the green grass effect, with sufficient fading to deliver a suitable image.\\n\\nThe next work based on the cow sculpture was \"Gladys as an Animal Control Vehicle\" in tribute to the Fairfield Police Department Animal Control Department.\\n\\nIn December 2005, the cow sculpture was used to create \"Gladys as a Shepherd\". The primary medium was blue and white textured cotton cloth.\\n\\nSection::::2006.\\nIn January 2006, the cow sculpture was converted to \"Gladys as a Cow\". The motif was a black and white spotted cow.\\n\\nIn April 2006, the sculpture was placed on display in Monroe, Connecticut.\\n\\nIn October 2006, the cow sculpture was painted as \"Gladys as a Skeleton\" and was incorporated into Gaffney\\'s Ghoulish House, a charity food drive with a halloween haunted house theme.\\n\\nSection::::2007.\\nIn December 2007, the cow sculpture was placed on display as \"Gladys as Santa Claus\". Along with Gladys, \"Goldie the Cow\" was created and decorated as a reindeer, and Sophie the Pig was created and decorated as an elf.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Gladys the Swiss Dairy Cow', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7862726'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '786566', 'text': \"Charter township\\n\\nA charter township is a form of local government in the U.S. state of Michigan. Townships in Michigan are organized governments. A charter township has been granted a charter, which allows it certain rights and responsibilities of home rule that are generally intermediate between those of a city (a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Michigan) and a village. Unless it is a home-rule village, the latter is subject to the authority of any township in which it is located.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSeeing the pressure of suburbanization in many post-war communities, in 1947, the state legislature created a special charter township status, which grants additional powers and streamlined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation of a township's land by cities and villages. As of November 2014, there were 118 charter townships in Michigan (Alpena Township became chartered in February 26, 2018). A township with a population of 2,000 or more may incorporate as a charter township and become a municipal corporation, which possesses all the powers of a non-charter township, in addition to those specified by the Charter Township Act of 1947.\\n\\nSection::::Government.\\nLegislative authority is exercised by an elected township board of seven members, consisting of the supervisor, the township clerk, the township treasurer, and four trustees, who are eligible to vote in elections and are residents of the township. All members of the board serve four-year terms. Unlike the boards for general law townships, which may have either five or seven members, a charter township must have seven members. If a general law township with a five-member board elects to become a charter township, two additional members are to be elected in the next general election.\\n\\nCharter townships may appoint either a township superintendent or township manager, who can be assigned responsibilities for managing township functions (this is comparable to cities that hire a city manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the city). Otherwise, executive authority lies with the supervisor, and various committees.\\n\\nSection::::Privileges.\\nA charter township may establish a variety of municipal services, such as a police force, fire department, assessors and also acquire property. It may also borrow money and issue bonds, with the approval of a majority of township voting in an election. Similarly, a charter township cannot levy taxes without the approval of a majority of the township population voting in an election. This is one significant difference from home-rule municipalities, in which the municipal authority can levy taxes without specific approval from voters.\\n\\nSection::::Requirements.\\nA charter township is mostly exempt from annexation from contiguous cities or villages providing that the township meets certain requirements:\\n\\nSection::::Annexation and 425 Agreements.\\nA charter township may still be subject to annexation under certain conditions, such as for the purpose of eliminating isolated islands of township or by vote of a majority of the residents of a portion of township. Temporary land transfers, which can involve charter townships, have provision under Public Act 425 of 1984. Under this statute, a charter township, for example, can have land transferred to a city in exchange for revenue sharing of the transferred parcels. These agreements, known as 425 Agreements, can last up to 50 years, and the land can either be completely transferred to the city or returned to the township upon fulfillment of the agreement.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Charter township', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786566'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7866339', 'text': 'Trish Keenan\\n\\nPatricia Anne Keenan (28 September 1968 â 14 January 2011) was an English musician and singer. She was the lead vocalist and founding member of the electronic band Broadcast, which she formed in 1996. The band released a total of five studio albums, including \"The Noise Made by People\" (2000), \"Haha Sound\" (2003), and \"Tender Buttons\" (2005), and earned a cult following.\\n\\nKeenan died unexpectedly in January 2011 of pneumonia, shortly after she had contracted swine flu while completing a tour of Australia with Broadcast.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nTrish Keenan was born in Winson Green, a multicultural inner-city area in west Birmingham, England. She was raised by her mother, who was a prostitute: \"I have got no problem with people knowing me or any personal details about myself,\" she commented. \"I have had a crazy life: I was brought up by a prostitute.\"\\n\\nKeenan attended Archbishop Grimshaw Roman Catholic school, presently known as John Henry Newman Catholic school. She worked a range of catering jobs after school until at the age of 21 she moved to Moseley, a bohemian enclave. She studied Creative Writing at Birmingham University while working on her music career. \\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSoon after moving to Moseley, Keenan formed a musical duo called Hayward Winters, and subsequently met James Cargill at a 1960s psychedelic revival club. The two of them formed a relationship over their shared interest and formed a folk band, Pan Am Flight Bag. The band was short-lived only performing two gigs before they reformed in 1996 as Broadcast, which included guitarist Tim Felton, drummer Steve Perkins, and keyboardist Roj Stevens.\\n\\nWith Broadcast, Keenan released a total of five studio albums, including \"The Noise Made by People\" (2000), \"Haha Sound\" (2003), and \"Tender Buttons\" (2005); Keenan wrote the latter while her father was dying of cancer in 2008. Also released in 2009 was the collaboration album \"Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age\", which the group wrote and recorded with The Focus Group, an English experimental band.\\n\\nKeenan lived in and near Birmingham throughout her life, and her music career was based there. In an interview with \"Billboard\", she said: \"There\\'s really a down tone in Birmingham. People here definitely underplay themselves. There\\'s definitely a lack of confidence, and almost a resignation and defeatism among musicians here.\"\\n\\nSection::::Artistry.\\nSection::::Musical style.\\nKeenan possessed a contralto vocal range. Music critics noted Keenan\\'s vocals as \"childlike\" and \"alluringly aloof,\" often \"woven within squishy analog synths, pastoral melodies, and mod-style rhythms.\" In a review published in \"Spin\" in 2001, Keenan\\'s vocals and instrumentation alongside bandmate James Cargill were likened to being \"stuck in a time warpâthe sound of \\'70s wife-swapping parties with beanbags and unhappy children serving sausages on sticks.\" Keenan often explored cut-up lyric techniques, inspired partly by her interest in the occult. \\n\\nSection::::Performances.\\nKeenan suffered from stage fright in the beginnings of her career, and earned a reputation for \"shoegazing onstage introversion.\" As the band progressed, however, Keenan\\'s stage fright receded: \"I used to get nervous like the whole of that day of the show, and now it only happens the moment I walk onstage,\" she said in a 1998 interview. \"When you listen to me sing my first line, you can always tell my heart is in my throat. Headlining gigs is a confidence booster.\"\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nDuring a tour in Australia just before Christmas, Keenan contracted the swine flu virus H1N1. It was reported on 14 January 2011 that she had died in the hospital. A statement by Warp Record Label said: \"This is an untimely, tragic loss and we will miss Trish dearly - a unique voice, an extraordinary talent and a beautiful human being. Rest in peace.\"\\n\\nWithin hours of her death, a link was posted on Broadcast\\'s Twitter to a mix of psychedelic, folk, and world music that Keenan had made for a friend prior to leaving for the band\\'s Australian tour. Shortly after, an intimate short film Keenan recorded on Super 8 was released, which showed festival-goers at the 2007 Moseley Folk festival. Tributes to Keenan were made from numerous musicians, including Toro y Moi, Graham Coxon of Blur, and Colin Meloy of The Decemberists.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Trish Keenan', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7866339'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7866937', 'text': 'British Virgin Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics\\n\\nThe British Virgin Islands competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'British Virgin Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7866937'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7867586', 'text': 'Home Again (New Edition album)\\n\\nHome Again is the sixth studio album by American R&B/pop group New Edition. Released on September 10, 1996, it is the only album to date to feature all six members of New EditionâBobby Brown, who\\'d left the group in 1985, rejoined the lineupâand was their final recording for MCA Records. Highly anticipated, and being their first album since, \"Heart Break\" (1988), the album debuted on the US \"Billboard\" 200 at number one, becoming the group\\'s first album to open at number one, selling 441,000 in its first week sales. It also topped the Irish Albums Chart, and the US \"Billboard\" R&B Albums Chart as the group\\'s first album in twelve years to do so since their self titled album in 1984. The album\\'s success spawned four singles which collectively received moderate \"Billboard\" chart success. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA, for sales and shipments of over two million copies on February 4, 1997.\\n\\nSection::::Overview.\\nSection::::History.\\nAfter the successful 1988 album, \"Heart Break\", the lineup of New Edition: Ralph Tresvant, Johnny Gill, Ricky Bell, Ronnie DeVoe, and Michael Bivins decided to go on hiatus as a group in order to pursue separate interests. With the exception of a surprise reunion of all six New Edition members performing at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1990, and song and music video for Bell Biv DeVoeâs 1991 single \"Word to the Mutha!\" (which featured Brown, Gill, and Tresvant), the group largely went their separate ways for the first half of the 1990s.\\n\\nUpon the advice of producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Bell, Bivins and DeVoe formed their own trio, Bell Biv DeVoe. Their album \"Poison\", released in 1990, sold over three million copies. The same year, Johnny Gillâwho had had a solo career before joining New Editionârevived it with his multi-platinum self-titled album. Also in 1990, Ralph Tresvant released his long-awaited solo debut album, which too went multi-platinum. In the mix, Bobby Brown, whose 1988 album, \"Don\\'t Be Cruel\", had sold over eight million copies, continued his success with the triple-platinum \"Bobby\" album in 1992. By this point, the group members were becoming as known for their side projects as they were as New Edition. Though when pressed by fans and journalists, the now fragmented band mates intermittently assured that they had planned to reunite to record another New Edition album, years passed before such plans were put into action, leaving their fans to wonder if their 1988 album, \"Heart Break\", was in fact the group\\'s swan song.\\n\\nHowever, by 1995, many of New Edition\\'s subsequent solo projects were not as successful as their first ventures. Meanwhile, the year had been notable for Bobby Brownâwho\\'d gained more media attention not for his music, but for his tumultuous marriage to Whitney Houston, and various troubles with the law. The same year, Bell, Bivins, DeVoe, Gill, and Tresvant decided to come together and begin production on the long-awaited, long-promised sixth New Edition album. Despite his notorious reputation and worldwide tabloid fodder, the group invited Brown (who had not been featured on a New Edition album since 1985\\'s \"All for Love\") back to join them, to which he agreed.\\n\\nSection::::Release and reaction.\\nNew Editionâs first new album in eight years, \"Home Again\", was released in September 1996âdebuting at number one on both the Billboard Top 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop album chart. The first single, \"Hit Me Off\", peaked at number one on the R&B chart and reached number three on the pop chart. Another top ten hit, \"I\\'m Still in Love With You\" was released toward years end. Other hits include: \"You Don\\'t Have to Worry\" and \"One More Day\". Another song \"Shop Around\" was not released as a single, but still found moderate airplay on R&B stations. \"Home Again\" went on to be certified double platinum, with sales of over two million, and became the groups greatest commercial success. The group originally recorded twenty songs for the project.\\n\\nHowever, their reunion tour was tainted by some of the members\\' egos. One evening as Brown extended his solo set, Ronnie DeVoe attempted to pull Brown off the stage. Eventually, Brown responded by dropping his microphone and a fist fight between the two ensued. This led to both members\\' security guards confronting each other, gun play was brought in, and the concert was halted. Bivins and Brown left the tour early, while DeVoe, Bell, Gill and Tresvant finished out the rest of the tour as a quartet. Brown later admitted during an interview that he was intoxicated during the tour.\\n\\nSection::::Track listing.\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Home Again (New Edition album)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7867586'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7868248', 'text': \"Ola Dybwad-Olsen\\n\\nOla Dybwad-Olsen (born August 4, 1946 in Oslo) is a former Norwegian footballer who played as a striker for Lyn, StabÃ¦k and Norway.

Leitz\\'s activities intensified after the Kristallnacht of November 1938, during which synagogues and Jewish shops were burned across Germany.\\n\\nGerman \"employees\" disembarking from the ocean liner \"Bremen\" at a New York pier went to Leitz\\'s Manhattan office, where they were helped to find jobs. Each new arrival was given a Leica camera. The refugees were paid a stipend until they could find work. Out of this migration came designers, repair technicians, salespeople, marketers and writers for the photographic press. The \"Leica Freedom Train\" was at its height in 1938 and early 1939, delivering groups of refugees to New York every few weeks until the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, when Germany closed its borders.\\n\\nLeitz was an internationally recognized brand that reflected credit on the newly resurgent Reich. The company produced range-finders and other optical systems for the German military. Also, the Nazi government urgently needed hard currency from abroad, and Leitz\\'s single biggest market for optical goods was the United States. Even so, members of the Leitz family and firm suffered for their good works. A top executive, Alfred Turk, was jailed for working to help Jews and freed only after the payment of a large bribe.\\n\\nLeitz\\'s daughter, Elsie Kuhn-Leitz, was imprisoned by the Gestapo after she was caught at the border, helping Jewish women cross into Switzerland. She eventually was freed but endured rough treatment in the course of questioning. She also fell under suspicion when she attempted to improve the living conditions of 700 to 800 Ukrainian slave laborers, all of them women, who had been assigned to work in the plant during the 1940s.\\n\\nSection::::Awards and commemoration.\\nAfter the war, Elsie Kuhn-Leitz received numerous honors for her humanitarian efforts, among them the Officier d\\'honneur des Palmes AcadÃ©miques from France in 1965 and the Aristide Briand Medal from the European Academy in the 1970s and Courage to Care Award from the Anti-Defamation League. According to Norman Lipton, a freelance writer and editor, the Leitz family wanted no publicity for its heroic efforts. Only after the last member of the Leitz family was dead did the \"Leica Freedom Train\" finally come to light. It is the subject of a book, \"The Greatest Invention of the Leitz Family: The Leica Freedom Train\" (American Photographic Historical Society, New York, 2002) by Frank Dabba Smith, a California-born rabbi currently living in England. In 2007, Ernst Leitz II was awarded posthumously the Courage To Care Award by the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Leica Freedom Train', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7873640'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7874008', 'text': 'Mimi Gibson\\n\\nMimi Gibson (born October 19, 1948) is a former child actress.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nAfter the early death of her father, her mother took her and her sister to Los Angeles. At only 18 months, she was a popular calendar model, posing with cute animals. By age two she was appearing in movies. \\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s she would appear in 34 movies and approximately 200 television episodes. Her last TV roles came as a teenage girlfriend in episodes of \"My Three Sons\" in the late 1960s. Her last film role was in \"If He Hollers\". \\n\\nIn 1957 she and child actress Evelyn Rudie played the daughters of John Wayne and Maureen O\\'Hara in \"The Wings of Eagles\". Although they had some significant scenes, she and Rudie were not credited. The same year she was in the horror B-movie \"The Monster That Challenged the World\".\\n\\nIn 1958 she had a role as Cary Grant\\'s daughter â with Paul Petersen and Charles Herbert playing her brothers â in the light romantic comedy \"Houseboat\", which also starred Sophia Loren. Gibson said, \"I\\'d like to be remembered for \"Houseboat\".\" She said \"\"Houseboat\" was fun, wonderful and I loved it\".\\n\\nThey filmed \"Houseboat\" for a month on location in Washington, D.C. The actual houseboat was on the Virginia (or south) side of the Potomac River. The scene at the amusement park was filmed at Glen Echo Amusement Park, on the northern side of the river. When the movie was completed, Loren gave Gibson a pendant with a houseboat on one side and \"To Mimi from Sophia\" on the other. Grant gave each of the children a $50 savings bond, a large sum in those days.\\n\\nIn 1961 she appeared in \"The Children\\'s Hour\", based on the play by Lillian Hellman. Gibson played a schoolgirl at a private school run by Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. The movie involved accusations of a lesbian relationship between the co-stars\\' characters and was somewhat daring for its time. She said Hepburn was very nice to the girls, but that \"Shirley MacLaine despised kids.\" She would not even speak to them. That same year, she was also in \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" alongside Mickey Maga, Barbara Baird, Sandra Abbot, and several other children. Gibson became known for this film for her line, \"I\\'m tired and I\\'m hungry and my tail\\'s froze...and my nose is froze and my ears are froze. And my toes are froze.\"\\n\\nOn television, Gibson appeared in five \"Playhouse 90\" dramas and many episodes of \"The Red Skelton Show\", as well as some episodes of \"Whirlybirds\" and \"Leave it to Beaver\".\\n\\nHaving worked since age 2 1/2, by nineteen, Mimi, along with many of her acting friends, found it hard to get roles because they were overexposed, and the casting directors were looking for \"new faces\". So, she went into retail and then became a realtor in the Los Angeles area. Mimi\\'s income as an actress was the sole support of her family and no money was set aside for her. Mimi has been married three times, the last marriage lasting almost thirty years.\\n\\nIn 1999 she testified before a California legislative panel on the need for statutory protection for child actors\\' earnings. She did this with Paul Petersen, who played her older brother in \"Houseboat\". Petersen has remained a lifelong friend and is the founder in 1990 of \"A Minor Consideration\", a nonprofit group devoted to protecting and advancing the interests of child actors. Gibson has also been active in this group.\\n', 'title': 'Mimi Gibson', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7874008'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'HAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7877318', 'text': 'Saner Wonggoun\\n\\nFormer Technical Sergeant Saner Wonggoun (; ; born January 22, 1947) is a Thai American who was the United States Air Force\\'s top fugitive from 1994 to 2006 as the principal suspect in his wife\\'s killing. After his November 2006 capture in a Thai market, Wonggoun unsuccessfully fought extradition and eventually pleaded guilty toâand was convicted ofâvoluntary manslaughter by court-martial.\\n\\nWonggoun was in federal prison until July, 2013.\\n\\nSection::::Immigration and enlistment.\\nBorn in Nakhon Nayok, Thailand, Saner Wonggoun moved to the United States at the age of 21 and enlisted in the Air Force in 1976. He gained United States citizenship in 1978, having dual citizenship with his home nation of Thailand.\\n\\nSection::::Desertion and capture.\\nAssigned to and living on Travis Air Force Base as an air cargo supervisor in January 1994, Wonggoun fled the country on January 14 when wanted for questioning by the authorities of Marin County, California. The sergeant was the primary suspect in the killing of his wife of 12 years (conflicting reports give 13), 42-year-old Sopha Wonggoun (nÃ©e Yodpet).\\n\\nHis wife\\'s body had been found a week earlier on January 7, 1994 wrapped in a sleeping bag along a deserted road off State Route 1. At the time of the killing, the couple had two children already and Sopha was eight-months pregnant. An autopsy later determined Sopha died of \"blunt force trauma to the head ... consistent with the shape of a hammer.\"\\n\\nIn the three to four days it took to identify the victim and obtain a search warrant for the Wonggouns\\' mobile home, Saner had received emergency leave and flew to Thailandâleaving his vehicle in the short-term parking at San Francisco International Airport.\\n\\nHeading the investigation, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) named Sergeant Wonggoun their number one fugitive; and, in October 2006, offered age-progressed images and a US$25,000 reward for information leading to Wonggoun\\'s capture. On November 3, following a tip-off by a Thai woman that Wonggoun was selling charcoal at the Khoke Matoom Market, the Royal Thai Police arrested Wonggoun in Phitsanulok Province.\\n\\nAfter his arrest, Wonggoun made several statements that were later published in the \"Phuket Gazette\". He allegedly confessed to killing his wife, admitting to bludgeoning her with a hammer after learning she was eight months pregnantâdespite living chaste with Wonggoun for almost a year. Saner further claimed that his wife had an addiction to gambling and had wasted a lot of money in this fashion. After fleeing the United States in 1994, Wonggoun never withdrew any of his US$81,700 for fear of being traced, nor was he aware that his son had made frequent trips to Thailand searching for him. Summarizing his time as a fugitive, Wonggoun claimed to have attempted suicide several times: \"I have been living in misery all along. I have been living on given time. No happiness or anything at all.\"\\n\\nSection::::Extradition.\\nCaptain Christine Millette with the AFOSI said Wonggoun would be court-martialed on charges of premeditated murder; the Uniform Code of Military Justice dictates a potential sentence of death or life imprisonment should he be convicted for the murder of his wife.\\n\\nAfter his arrest, Wonggoun insisted he be considered a Thai citizen and subject to Thai jurisdiction. However, in December 2007 Thailand\\'s Appeals Court found that as the killing took place in the United States, and Wonggoun is a US citizen, he was subject to the US judicial system.\\n\\nOn February 15, 2008, Wonggoun was transferred to the custody of the AFOSI Detachment 303 at Travis AFB; because OSI investigators believed that Sopha was killed on base, Marin County relinquished legal jurisdiction to the Air Force.\\n\\nSection::::Trial.\\nSection::::Article 32 hearing.\\nOn March 19, 2008, Air Force prosecutors convened an Article 32 hearing to determine whether there was probable cause that a crime occurred and that Wonggoun committed it. During the two-day hearing, the prosecution and defense counsels (Majors Tara Villena and Mark Etheridge, respectively) questioned the original Marin County investigator, Detective Steven Nash, and Wonggoun\\'s 21-year-old daughter, Sophia Wonggoun Burtram.\\n\\nBurtram testified that she may have inadvertently informed her father about her mother\\'s boyfriend shortly before her death. When questioned by the defense counsel, she supported the argument for voluntary manslaughter, testifying that she had never seen her father act violently or aggressively toward her mother.\\n\\nThe evidence, testimony, and arguments of counsel were reviewed by the proceeding\\'s investigating officer, Colonel Steven Ehlenbeck., who found probable cause.\\n\\nSection::::Court-martial.\\nProceeding to court-martial, Wonggoun requested a court trial as opposed to a military jury panel. On July 28, 2008 the court martial began with Wonggoun pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Wonggoun explained that he understood the ramifications of his plea, and detailed the killing upon questioning by the presiding Judge, Colonel William Burd.\\n\\nReiterating some of his November 2006 comments, Wonggoun explained that the January 6, 1994 killing was not planned, and resulted from an argument. According to Wonggoun, not only had his wife accrued over US$20,000 in gambling debts, but on the day of the killing, he learned that Sopha was pregnant and he was \"100 percent\" sure the child wasn\\'t his. Retrieving a claw hammer from his storage room, \"... I hit her one time and she fell on the floor, and after that I realized what I did, I lost control of myself ... everything was just dark.\" Wonggoun explained to Colonel Burd that it was never his intention to kill his wife, but that \"I was mad. I wanted to teach her a lesson.\" Arguing for a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, defense attorneys showed that Wonggoun\\'s own frank candidness about the killing, as well as his \"[anger], being in the sudden heat of passion, [was] the only explanation.\"\\n\\nDespite Wonggoun\\'s plea, Air Force prosecutors proceeded with a charge of premeditated murder. TSgt Don Osborn explained that unlike a civilian trial, \"it\\'s not like a plea bargain. He doesn\\'t get to choose.\" Major Villena argued that the couple\\'s money problems were the motive for premeditation, and that Wonggoun had been disturbed about his wife\\'s problems for some time beforehand: \"He\\'s not going from 0 to 100 in two seconds.\" Further, Wonggoun\\'s methodical and systematic cleanup and disposal of his wife\\'s body evidenced calculation beyond a sudden decision to kill.\\n\\nSection::::Conviction, sentencing and imprisonment.\\nOn July 30, 2008, Colonel Burd found Wonggoun guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and imposed a sentence of 10 years military confinement, a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a reduction in rank to Airman Basic (E-1). On April 27, 2010, a panel of the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence; the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces later denied review.

Sunset High is considered one of the premier high schools in Beverly Hills and many of the students who attend there are the offspring of those who work in the entertainment industry, one of the biggest employers in Los Angeles and its claim to fame.\\n\\nA few of the students (Monica Miller for example) are stars themselves. Some kids, though, are from more conventional and ordinary families. One of the students, Josh Ross, attends Sunset due to his mom working at the school as the school nurse (His family lived in nearby Culver City, California).\\n\\nThe story begins when Kristin Sullivan, a Junior who is from St. Cloud, Minnesota with her parents, Garth and Lila Sullivan and her younger brother, Shawn, arrives at Sunset High.

Its patients enjoyed a bowling alley, private rooms, recreational activities, jobs within the hospital, some even being able to leave regularly. The entire complex consisted of 23 buildings, the largest being the Acute Intensive Care Center, named Hilltop (building 4). The facility also contained a boiler plant, garage, warehouse, administration building, recreation building, five extended treatment wards, two geriatric wards, and two kitchen buildings. At the time of its closure in 1998, its superintendent was Aidan Altenor. Its closure was due in part to a lawsuit using the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as well as the general deinstitutionalization of the state hospital system.

The first buildings to come down were the administration and recreation buildings, followed by the extended treatment and geriatric wards. The final two buildings to be demolished were the boiler plant, and the five story Hilltop building which finally fell on January 17, 2008. Currently, the upper portion of the property is being developed into housing, while the lower portion was developed into athletic and recreation areas for the township. The vast woods surrounding the property to the south and west have been allowed to remain. The Reserve now boasts over 5 miles of hiking trails, an all accessible playground built completely by volunteers call Freedom Playground, a dog park with a section for each small and large dogs, two grass fields, one synthetic turf soccer/football/lacrosse field, one synthetic turf baseball/softball diamond, and the Community Recreation & Environmental Center.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Haverford State Hospital', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7888003'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'JgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7888242', 'text': 'Mandrake Root\\n\\n\"Mandrake Root\" is a song by Deep Purple that is featured on their debut album \"Shades of Deep Purple\". The title is in reference to the mandrake plant, but is also the name of a pre-Purple band that Blackmore was trying to form in Germany when he got the call from Deep Purple\\'s original management.\\n\\nSection::::Recording.\\nDeep Purple recorded their first studio album in May 1968. Of the eight songs that were included, (an additional one, \"Shadows\", was cut as a demo but scrapped from the album), only four of them were written by the band itself. Additionally, one of these songs, \"And the Address\", is an instrumental. The studio version of \"Mandrake Root\" is just over six minutes long. Many full recordings of the live arrangement exceed the twenty-minute mark.\\n\\n\"Mandrake Root\" was performed and recorded at the same time as their first instrumental, \"And the Address\", and was originally meant to be an instrumental as well. The lyrics weren\\'t added until after rehearsals took place before the album-recording of \"Shades of Deep Purple\" in May, 1968, the group having decided that they did not want more than one instrumental track on the album. It was recorded on Sunday, 12 May. The song features many sound effects, which were picked from the BBC Library.\\n\\nSection::::Writing.\\nThe song has a rather controversial writing history. Though it is officially credited to Rod Evans, Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore, according to Jerry Bloom\\'s unauthorized biography of Ritchie Blackmore, the chord progression and melody were first written by a guy called Bill Parkinson and named \"Lost Soul\". The song was conceived as a drum solo for Carlo Little (Rolling Stones\\' original drummer), who like Blackmore had played with The Savages, the backing band for Screaming Lord Sutch. Simper said Blackmore learned the melody \"note for note\" from Little. Bill Parkinson was lead guitarist with the Savages Jul-Sep 1966, while Blackmore had played with Sutch May-Oct 1962, Feb-May 1965 and Dec 1966-Apr 1967, so their paths had clearly crossed. As this song, along with \"Hush,\" pushed the fledgeling band sky high, it wasn\\'t surprising that word about it got back to Parkinson. Not happy with regard \"to what he saw as the rip-off\" of \"Lost Soul,\" Parkinson turned up on Simper\\'s doorstep to complain. He threatened court action to Simper, who at that time already left Deep Purple but agreed with some reluctance to testify for him. \"But,\" Simper said, \"...I never saw Bill again. Apparently they paid him off with about Â£600.\"\\n\\nSection::::Live performances.\\nThe song would become an early concert staple for the band, with the keyboard and guitar solos extended at times for up to 15 minutes. One of the few Mk I era songs to continue being played by Mk II and sung by Ian Gillan, a similar instrumental would be paired in later years with the extended live versions of \"Space Truckin\\'.\" In the version of \"Space Truckin\\'\" recorded for the 1972 live \"Made In Japan\" album, riffs from \"Mandrake Root\" can be plainly heard during the instrumental parts.\\n\\nIt is one of the few Mk I tracks that was a regular feature of Mk II\\'s early setlist, as it provided a vehicle for lengthy organ and guitar solos from Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore, respectively. It is also one of two Deep Purple songs that were written by the Mk I lineup, and later re-worked by Ian Gillan for Mk II. The other one is \"Bird Has Flown,\" originally featured on the album \"Deep Purple\" from 1969.\\n\\nFor the guitar solo, Blackmore would frequently throw his guitar into the air, play it with his feet, or perform similar crowd pleasing tricks.\\n', 'title': 'Mandrake Root', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7888242'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'JwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7888774', 'text': 'Delaine Buses\\n\\nDelaine Buses is a bus operator based in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn 1890 William Smith began a horse drawn passenger service.

In 2015 a CNN story reported that the mall had begun to attract tenants after extensive renovations and remodeling, though large portions still remained vacant. According to another article published in January 2018, after more than a decade of high vacancy, most retail spaces had been filled and the mall featured an IMAX-style cinema and theme park. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe mall was built on former farmlands in the Wanjiang District of Dongguan in southern coastal China. The project was spearheaded by Hu Guirong (Alex Hu), who became a billionaire in the instant noodle industry. Upon opening, South China Mall became the largest mall in the world, surpassing the Golden Resources Mall.

Targeted initially to an affluent market (the big cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen are adjacent), Dongguan is itself mainly a city of low income migrant laborers who failed to respond to all the attractions the mall had to offer. Much of the retail space remained empty, with over 99% of the stores still vacant in 2008. The only occupied areas were near the entrance where several Western fast food chains are located and a parking structure re-purposed as a kart racing track. A planned Shangri-La Hotel was not completed.\\n\\nFilmmaker Sam Green made a short film about the South China Mall called \"Utopia Part 3: the World\\'s Largest Shopping Mall\" which premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcast on PBS\\'s documentary series \"POV\".\\n\\nOriginally called \"South China Mall\", the centre was redubbed as \"New South China Mall, Living City\" in September 2007. The 2007 makeover was orchestrated by Founder Group, which took over the property from the original owner Hu Guirong in December 2006.\\n\\nIn 2013, \"Vagabond Journey\" writer Wade Shepard wrote about his recent visit to the mall. He acknowledged that most visitors attend the mall for its movie theaters featuring IMAX, and that families did gather in the play area. He also noticed that 4 full floors of the mall were unused, and that the water of the artificial indoor canals had turned green.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\nIts total area is , with almost of leasable space sufficient for as many as 2,350 stores.\\n\\nThe mall has seven zones modeled on international cities, nations and regions, including Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Venice, Egypt, the Caribbean, and California.

Over the next 15 years, this was incrementally upgraded until it supported an additional twelve 150 MW units and two 300 MW units. In 1970 the final configuration of Frimmersdorf II was reached and the power station held the record of the world largest thermal power station. \\n\\n1988 saw the installation of Flue-gas desulfurization scrubbers, while the two 100 MW units were shut down on 30 June. \\nStarting in 2005 most of the units have been shut down until 2013.

Within RCA in the early days (ca 1970s), the 1801 and 1802 microprocessors were sometimes referred to as \"the COSMAC\". Hobbyists usually refer to it simply as \"the 1802\". It is being manufactured by Intersil Corporation as a high-reliability microprocessor. The 1802 has an architecture different from most other 8-bit microprocessors.\\n\\nIn 1970 and 1971, Joseph Weisbecker developed a new 8-bit architecture computer system called FRED (Flexible Recreational Educational Device). Working on it at home, the RCA engineer hoped that FRED would become the basis of a personal computer sold by his company. RCA released Weisbecker\\'s work as the COSMAC 1801U and 1801R (also known as TA6889/TA6890 and TC 1084/TC 1085) in early 1975, using its CMOS process (called \"COS/MOS\", an acronym for \"Complementary Silicon/Metal-oxide Semiconductor\"). In 1976, a team led by Jerry Herzog integrated the two chips into one, the 1802.\\n\\nSuccessors to the 1802 are the CDP1804, CDP1805, and CDP1806, which have an extended instruction set, other enhanced features (like on-chip RAM and ROM, and built-in Timer), with some versions running at faster clock speeds, though not a significant speed difference. Some features are also lost, like the DMA auto-boot loader functionality. There are also some minor pin function changes.\\n\\nSection::::Introduction.\\nThe RCA 1802 has a static core CMOS design with no minimum clock frequency, so that it can be run at very low speeds and low power, including a clock frequency of zero to suspend the microprocessor without affecting its operation. It has two separate 8-pin buses: an 8-bit bidirectional data bus and a time-multiplexed address bus, with the high-order and low-order 8-bits of the 16-bit address being accessed on alternate clock cycles.\\n\\nThe 1802 has a single bit, programmable and testable output port (Q), and four input pins which are directly tested by branch instructions (EF1-EF4).\\n\\nIts I/O mode is flexible and programmable, and it has a single-phase clock with an on-chip oscillator. Its register set consists of sixteen 16-bit registers. The program counter (PC) can reside in any of these, and is settable using the SEP Rn instruction, providing a simple way to implement multiple PCs, and to perform subroutine calls. (see Subroutine calls below). Similarly, pointers and indirect addressing use the X register (SEX Rn instruction), or the 16 registers can be used as general purpose registers. DMA In and Out and Interrupts use specific registers.\\n\\nSection::::Applications.\\nSection::::Radiation hardening.\\nIn addition to \"bulk silicon\" C2L CMOS technology, the 1802 was also available fabricated in Silicon on Sapphire (SOS) semiconductor process technology, which gives it a degree of resistance to radiation and electrostatic discharge (ESD). Along with its extreme low-power abilities, this makes the chip well-suited in space and military applications (also, at the time the 1802 was introduced, very few, if any, other radiation-hardened microprocessors were available in the market). The radiation hardened 1802 version was manufactured at Sandia National Laboratories in agreement with RCA.\\n\\nSection::::Space technology and science.\\nThe 1802 was used in many spacecraft and space science programs, experiments, projects and modules such as the Galileo spacecraft, various Earth-orbiting satellites and satellites carrying amateur radio.\\n\\nThe 1802 has also been verified from NASA source documentation to have been used in the Hubble Space Telescope, the Magellan Venus probe and others.\\n\\nSection::::Microcomputer systems.\\nA number of were based on the 1802, including the COSMAC ELF (1976), Netronics ELF II, Quest SuperELF, COSMAC VIP, Comx-35, Finnish Telmac 1800 and Oscom Nano, Yugoslav Pecom 32 and 64, and the Cybervision systems sold through Montgomery Ward in the late 70s, as well as the RCA Studio II video game console (one of the first consoles to use bitmapped graphics). The Edukit single board computer (SBC) trainer system, similar to an expanded COSMAC Elf, was offered by Modus Systems Ltd. in Britain in the early 1980s. Infinite Incorporated produced an 1802-based, S-100 bus expandable console computer trainer in the late 1970s called the UC1800, available assembled or in kit form.\\n\\nAs part of 1802 Retrocomputing hobbyist work, other computers have been built more recently (post-2000), including the Membership Card microcomputer kit that fits in an Altoids tin and the Spare Time Gizmos Elf 2000 (Elf 2K), among others. See Emulators and Simulators for other systems.\\n\\nSection::::Product integration.\\nThe 1802 was also used in scientific instruments and commercial products. \\nPost-1980 Chrysler and associated model vehicles use the 1802 in their second-generation Electronic Lean-Burn System, with electronic spark control, one of the first on-board auto computer-based control systems.\\n\\nThe 1802 was used in the manufacture of many pinball machines and video arcade games in Spain.\\n\\nSection::::Programming languages.\\nThe first high-level language available for the 1802 was Forth, provided by Forth, Inc. in 1976. Other available programming languages, both interpreters and compilers, are CHIP-8 (and variants), 8th (a version of Forth created by Lee Hart), Tom Pittman\\'s Tiny BASIC, C, various Assemblers and cross-assemblers, and others. Other specialty languages were used by federal agencies such as NASA and its installations, including Johnson Space Center, AMES, Goddard, Langley, Marshall, and Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL), which included the HAL/S cross-compiler, STOIC, a Forth-like language, and others.\\n\\nSection::::Emulators and simulators.\\nThe 1802 chip and computers using the microprocessor have been emulated and simulated in hardware and/or software by hobbyists. One design is in VHDL for an FPGA. A bus-accurate, full speed COSMAC Elf clone was created without a CDP1802 microprocessor chip or CDP1861 video chip using PIC microcontrollers. An online simulator of the COSMAC Elf (enhanced) written in JavaScript runs in the user\\'s browser with no need to download.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\nSection::::Part number suffix designations.\\nVarious suffixes to the CDP1802 part number denote technical specifications, including (A, B, & C) \"operating speed\" (3.2\\xa0MHz to 6.4\\xa0MHz), \"temperature\" (-40\\xa0Â°C to +85\\xa0Â°C, -55\\xa0Â°C to +125\\xa0Â°C), and \"voltage ranges\" (4V to 10.5V), \"package type\" (D, E, Q), and \"burn-in\" (X). These were somewhat standardized between the various source suppliers, including RCA, Intersil, Harris, Hughes Aircraft, and Solid State Scientific (SSS). Hughes used the HCMP prefix, and SSS used the SCP (and possibly BCP) prefix, instead of CDP, and had additional suffixes that have not been documented as of yet. (examples: CDP1802A, CDP1802ACE, CDP1802BCD, HCMP1802AP, SCP1802D)\\n\\nSection::::Registers and I/O.\\nThe 1802 is an 8-bit byte machine, with minimal support for 16-bit operations, except via 2-byte manipulation. The primary accumulator is the 8-bit \\'D\\' register (Data register). The single bit carry flag is DF (Data Flag). Most operations use the D register, including arithmetic and logic and memory reference load and store instructions. Most 16-bit operations have to work on the lower byte and then the upper byte, via D, using the DF as carry and borrow as needed. Instructions allow the get and put of the upper and lower bytes of the sixteen 16-bit registers via D. However, the 16-bit registers can be incremented and decremented with single instructions, and a few instructions perform automatic increment and decrement, like LDA (load advance) and STXD (store via X and decrement). 16-bit register and value comparisons would also need to use the D register as a go-between, using multiple instructions to perform the operations.\\n\\nAn important feature of the 1802 is the register design of sixteen registers of 16 bits each. Using the SEP instruction, you can select any of the 16 registers to be the program counter; using the SEX instruction, you can select any of the 16-bit registers to be the index register. Register R0 has the special use of holding the memory address for the built-in DMA controller. Register R1 has the special use of being the program counter for the interrupt handler.\\n\\nThe processor has five special I/O lines. There is a single Q output that can be set with the SEQ instruction and reset with the REQ instruction. There are four external, single-bit flag inputs, EF1, EF2, EF3, and EF4, and there are eight dedicated branch instructions to conditionally branch based on the state of those input lines. There are seven Input and seven Output port instructions that utilize the RX register and D accumulator.\\n\\nThe EF and Q lines were typically used for multiple interfaces on 1802-based hobbyist computers because of the lines\\' favorable and easy handling. It was typical for the Q line to drive a status LED, a cassette interface, an RS-232 interface, and the speaker. This meant that the user could actually hear RS-232 and cassette data being transmitted (unless a volume control was implemented). Traditionally, the EF4 line is attached to the INPUT momentary pushbutton on the COSMAC Elf. Other systems might use one of the other lines.\\n\\nThere are some other special use registers and flags, some internal, and some usable programmatically: 4-bit N, P, X, and I; 8-bit T; and 1-bit IE.\\n\\nSection::::Branching.\\nThere are three types of unconditional and conditional branching in the 1802, Short and Long, and Skips.\\n\\nShort branches are 2-byte instructions, and use 256-byte range, single byte address, page absolute addressing in the range 0 to 255 (hex FF). There is no relative branching. The short branch always jumps within the page that contains the address byte.\\n\\nLong branches use full 16-bit addressing to support the 64K memory address space, and are the only 3-byte instructions.\\n\\nSkip instructions increment the PC by one for the unconditional Short Skip, or two for the Long Skips. Only the Long Skip has conditional branching.\\n\\nSection::::Subroutine calls.\\nThe processor does not have standard subroutine CALL address and RET instructions, though they can be simulated. The 16-register design makes possible some interesting subroutine call and return mechanisms, though they are better suited to small programs than general purpose coding.\\n\\nA few commonly used subroutines can be called quickly by keeping their address in one of the 16 registers; however, the called subroutine must know (hard coded) what the calling PC register is to perform the \"return\" instruction. The SEP instruction is used to call a subroutine pointed to by one of the 16-bit registers and another SEP to return to the caller (SEP stands for \"Set Program Counter\", and selects which one of the 16 registers is to be used as the program counter from that point onward). Before a subroutine returns, it jumps to the location immediately preceding its entry point so that after the SEP \"return\" instruction returns control to the caller, the register will be pointing to the right value for next usage. (the processor always increments the PC after reference and usage (retrieving the next instruction to execute), so this technique works as noted)\\n\\nAn interesting variation of this scheme is to have two or more subroutines in a ring so that they are called in round robin order. On early hobbyist computers, tricks and techniques like this were commonly used in the horizontal refresh interrupt to reprogram the scan line address to repeat each scan line four times for the video controller.\\n\\nOne well-known and often-used routine is known as SCRT (Standard CALL and RETURN Technique), which allows general purpose subroutine Call and Return, including passing of parameters \"in line\", and nested subroutines using a stack. Although any of the available registers can be used for this technique, per programmer\\'s preference, many use the routine supplied by RCA in the CDP1802 User Manual, where the suggested register usage is R2 = Stack Pointer, R3 = General Program Counter (PC), R4 = Call, R5 = Return, R6 = Passed Arguments Pointer (non-destructive). Even though these supportive routines are small, there is an execution speed overhead using them. (as opposed to what would be incurred if actual CALL and RET instructions were part of the microprocessor\\'s design) This setup allows R0 to be used for DMA and R1 to be used for Interrupts, if desired, allowing R7 through RF (hex) for general program usage.\\n\\nSection::::Addressing modes.\\nBecause of the 16-bit address bus, and the 8-bit data bus, the sixteen general purpose registers are 16 bits wide, but the accumulator D-register is only 8 bits wide. The accumulator, therefore, tends to be a bottleneck. Transferring the contents of one register to another involves four instructions (one Get and one Put on the HI byte of the register, and a similar pair for the LO byte: GHI R1; PHI R2; GLO R1; PLO R2). Similarly, loading a new constant into a register (such as a new address for a subroutine jump, or the address of a data variable) also involves four instructions (two load immediate, LDI, instructions, one for each half of the constant, each one followed by a Put instruction to the register, PHI and PLO).\\n\\nThe two addressing modes \"Indirect register\", and \"Indirect register with auto-increment\" are then fairly efficient, to perform 8-bit operations on the data in the accumulator. There are no other addressing modes, though. Thus, the \"direct addressing\" mode needs to be emulated using the four instructions mentioned earlier to load the address into a spare register; followed by an instruction to select that register as the index register; followed, finally, by the intended operation on the data variable that is pointed to by that address.\\n\\nSection::::DMA and load mode.\\nThe CDP1802 has a built-in DMA controller, having two DMA request lines for DMA input and output operations. R0 is used as the DMA address pointer.\\n\\nThe DMA controller also provides a special \"load mode\", which allows loading of memory while the CLEAR and WAIT inputs of the processor are active. This allows a program to be loaded without the need for a ROM-based bootstrap loader. This was used by the COSMAC Elf microcomputer and its successors to load a program from toggle switches or a hexadecimal keypad with no required software and minimal hardware.\\n\\nSection::::Instruction timing.\\nClock cycle efficiency is poor in comparison to most 8-bit microprocessors. Eight clock cycles makes up one machine cycle. Most instructions take two machine cycles (16 clock cycles) to execute; the remaining instructions take three machine cycles (24 clock cycles). By comparison, the MOS Technology 6502 takes two to seven clock cycles to execute an instruction, and the Intel 8080 takes four to 18 clock cycles.\\n\\nSection::::Support chips.\\nSection::::Graphics.\\nIn early 1802-based microcomputers, the companion graphics Video Display Controller chip, RCA CDP1861 (for the NTSC video format, CDP1864 variant for PAL), used the built-in DMA controller to display black and white bitmapped graphics on standard TV screens. The 1861 was also known as the Pixie graphics system.\\n\\nAlthough the faster versions of 1802 could operate at 4â5\\xa0MHz (at 5\\xa0V; it was faster (6.4\\xa0MHz) at 10\\xa0V), it was usually operated at 3.58\\xa0MHz divided by 2 (1.76\\xa0MHz) to suit the requirements of the 1861 chip which gave a speed of a little over 100,000 instructions per second.\\n\\nThe CDP1862 Color Generator Circuit IC, an 1861 companion chip, could be used to generate color graphics. Some computer systems, like the Pecom 64, used the VIS (Video Interface System), consisting of the CDP1869 and CDP1870 companion ICs, for somewhat higher resolution color graphics.\\n\\nSection::::Code samples.\\nThis code snippet example is a diagnostic routine that tests ALU (Arithmetic and Logic Unit) Operations.\\n\\nNote: The above routine presumes that the CDP1802 microprocessor is in an initial reset state (or that it has been set as such prior to executing this code). Therefore, the program counter (PC) and the X indirect register \\'pointer\\' are both set to 16-bit register R0. That is why you can output an immediate value, as in the example \\'OUT 4,00\\', because PC and X are both pointing to R0. The PC is incremented after the opcode instruction byte is retrieved from memory, so it points to the next address when the OUT 4 is executed. Therefore, it outputs the value in memory pointed to by RX = R0, which is the next immediate byte. The OUT instruction also increments the X register, which is R0, which is also the PC, so it outputs the immediate value after the OUT and continues program execution at the next instruction address after the immediate value. This is why you see the routine set X (SEX) to register R6 and R0 as needed. Also note that, although the OUT opcode increments the RX register, to easily output a section of memory (\\'buffer\\'), INP does not. It stores the value at the address pointed to by RX and into the D 8-bit data byte accumulator, but RX is not modified.\\n\\nThe routine also presumes that OUT 4 will display the value in the CPU system\\'s 8-bit LED or 2-digit hex display, and IN 4 gets the value from the eight toggle switches (or possibly the hex keypad). The BN4 opcode (loop; * = \\'this address\\'), \"branch if the single-bit input EF4 line is lo\", is used to test if the momentary \\'Input\\' pushbutton is pressed. The B4 opcode (\\'if hi\\') loop waits for the button to be released. SEQ and REQ turn the single Q line, which is usually attached to an LED, on and off.\\n\\nThe 1802 is a \"byte machine\", but has 16 16-bit registers, R0-RF (sometimes referred to as 0-F without the \\'R\\' prefix). To deal with 16-bit register data, the programmer must Get and Put the Hi or Lo values of the registers using the D accumulator as the go-between.

This school is the only public high school within the city limits of Hutchinson. The enrollment for 2013-2014 was 1,487 students. The school mascot is the Salthawk and the school colors are blue and gold. During 2016-2017, the principal is Ronn Roehm and activities director is Kevin Armstrong.\\n\\nHutchinson High School is a member of the Kansas State High School Activities Association. Athletic teams compete in the 5A and 6A divisions and are known as the \"Salthawks\". Extracurricular activities are also offered in the form of performing arts, school publications, and clubs. The Salthawk football team won six consecutive state championships from 2004-2009.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe first high school in Hutchinson was established in 1872 to help educate the growing population of Hutchinson. The first high school graduating class occurred in 1882. Due to the demand for more space, a new high school was constructed in 1891 at 5th and Maple. This location would last for nineteen years. In 1910, the city voted to approve the construction of a new $125,000 high school, located at 7th and Walnut. In 1930, the Salt Hawk (shortened to Salthawk in the 1990s) became the school\\'s official mascot. The high school would remain in this location until 1960 when, due to inadequate conditions, Hutchinson High moved to its current location at 13th and Severance.\\n\\nSection::::School layout.\\nHutchinson High School consists of several halls. A Hall is the longest hall in the school. It is attached to the Salthawk Activity Center at the west and runs to the east where it turns north toward the cafeteria. A Hall is bisected by the recently constructed M Hall which houses upgraded drama, band, orchestra and choir rooms. The \"M-Hall Expansion\" also included the construction of a new auditorium, allowing for the old one to be repurposed into a learning facility. This also created new space for an upgraded 3-D art room, making use of the previous \"backstage\" area. Apart from A and M hall, there is B, C, G, F, and V halls. The Hutchinson Career and Vocational Technology Education (HCTEA or V hall) buildings, including the recently constructed T Building, stand alone. There are three gymnasiums on campus (North Gym, South Gym, and the Main Gym/Salthawk Activity Center, known better as \\'the SAC\\') Many students attend classes and athletics practices (dominant swimming) at the YMCA close to campus. Students are also allowed to make the short trip to nearby Hutchinson Community College to take classes.\\n\\nSection::::Extracurricular activities.\\nThe Salthawks are classified as a 6A school, the largest classification in Kansas according to the Kansas State High School Activities Association.

They have traditionally been a Democratic constituency, in the main.\\n\\nSection::::Hispanic/Latino Participation and Key Issues.\\nAccording to U.S. Census Bureau population estimates as of July 1, 2013, there are roughly 54 million Hispanics living in the United States, representing approximately 17% of the U.S. total population, making people of Hispanic origin the nation\\'s largest ethnic minority. Mexican Americans alone are 64% of Hispanics, the Democratic Party is considered to be in a far stronger position among Hispanics overall. The U.S. Census indicates that the Hispanic population of the United States is the fastest growing minority group in the country.\\n\\nMore than 9% of eligible voters nationwide are Latino. The majority support for Democratic candidates continues a pattern among Hispanic voters. In a December 2011 poll, 67% of Hispanics said they were Democrats, and 20% said they were Republicans.\\n\\nIn the 2010 midterm elections, 60% of Hispanics voted Democratic, while 38% voted Republican. In 2008, 67% of Hispanics voted for Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama, while 31% of Hispanics voted for Republican presidential candidate John McCain. In 2006, 69% of Latino voters supported Democratic candidates in congressional races, while 30% supported Republican candidates.\\n\\nAccording to an October 2010 report by the Pew Hispanic Center, Hispanics rank education, jobs, and health care as their top three issues of concern. Immigration ranks as the fourth most important issue for all Latinos.\\n\\nA 2012 study by the Center for Immigration Studies projected that in November 2012 Hispanics would comprise 17.2 percent of the total U.S. population, 15 percent of adults, 11.2 percent of adult citizens, and 8.9 percent of actual voters. By comparison, the report found that in 2012, non-Hispanic whites are expected to be 73.4 percent of the national vote and non-Hispanic blacks are expected to be 12.2 percent. The report noted that by weight \"eight percentage points of the Hispanic vote nationally equals slightly less than one percentage point of the non-Hispanic white vote.\" The study also compared the 8.9 percent Hispanic share of voters to veterans (12 percent of the electorate), those with family incomes above $100,000 (18 percent), seniors 65 and older (19 percent), married persons (60 percent), and those who live in owner-occupied housing (80 percent).\\n\\nIn terms of voter turnout, the Center for Immigration Studies projected that 52.7 percent (Â± 0.6) of eligible Hispanics will vote in the 2012 election, an increase from 49.9 percent in 2008 and a continuation of the past decade\\'s long upward trend. The projected Hispanic voter participation rate of 52.7 percent compares to 66.1 percent for non-Hispanic whites and 65.2 percent for non-Hispanic blacks in 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Democrats and Hispanic/Latino Voters.\\nSupport for the Democratic Party among Hispanics has remained strong because of the Democratic Party\\'s platform of less immigration restrictions, civil rights for Hispanics, and support for social programs that tend to benefit low-income Hispanic families. Although some Latino leaders have criticized the party for not doing enough to help Latino candidates move from city council, legislative and congressional seats to the party\\'s highest elected offices. Former New Mexico Governor Bill Richardson, a candidate in the 2008 U.S. Presidential election, has noted that victories by Hispanic Republican candidates in several key races during the 2010 election cycle, including Marco Rubio in Florida\\'s U.S. Senate race and the elections of Brian Sandoval as Nevada\\'s first Hispanic governor and Susana Martinez as the country\\'s first Latina governor, have posed a significant challenge to the Democratic Party in retaining support among Hispanic and Latino voters. \"Democrats have to recruit more Hispanic candidates and they have to start siding with Hispanics on redistricting and other issues,\" Richardson said, \"because many Hispanics perceive the party doesn\\'t care enough about electing more Hispanic officials.\"\\n\\nOther Hispanic Democrats, including former DNC vice-chairwoman Linda Chavez-Thompson, have accused the party of taking Hispanic support for granted, and not doing enough to increase turnout among Latinos: \"I think for the longest time [the Democratic Party], including myself, automatically thought that if you were a Latino you voted Democrat,\" she said. \"Thatâs not true anymore. We need to ramp up our Latino outreach. We canât sit back and let the Republicans take votes because we donât have a message for Latino voters.\" Chavez-Thompson, who ran an unsuccessful campaign for Lieutenant Governor of Texas in 2010, further stated that more money and effort needs to be spent by the Democratic Party and its supporters on targeted messaging, recruitment. \\n\\nThe Democratic Party however has some issues with Hispanics regarding abortion, gay rights, and stance on limited government, especially in matters of religious freedom.\\n\\nSection::::Republicans and Hispanic/Latino Voters.\\nSection::::Republican Outreach to Hispanic and Latino Voters.\\nRepublicans have long maintained their party is a natural fit for Hispanics, particularly recent immigrants, because of the party\\'s social conservatism, anti-abortion stance and positions for private school vouchers and other school choice proposals as well as lower taxes. Republicans are trying to chip away at Hispanicsâ overall 2-1 preference for Democrats.\\n\\nFormer Florida Governor Jeb Bush and Former Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich have taken proactive measures. Jeb Bush chairs the Hispanic Leadership Network, an ongoing effort by the American Action Network and the American Action Forum to provide a platform for the Hispanic community to connect with center-right policies and leaders. Newt Gingrich started The Americano, a bilingual news and commentary web site that promotes conservative ideals within the Hispanic community.\\n\\nSection::::Hispanic/Latino Criticism of the Republican Party.\\nThe main divider between Hispanics and Republicans is the differing views and perceived harsh rhetoric on illegal immigration and racism. 81% of Latinos believe that unauthorized immigrants should not be deported. Some Republicans encourage reforming the immigration system, while other Republicans advocate deporting them all. Republicans also support efforts to enforce the law (deporting illegal aliens), while most Republicans are open to welcoming back immigrants who enter America through legal avenues.\\n\\nFormer Rep. Lincoln Diaz-Balart, R-Fla. said, âIf we become perceived as an anti-immigrant party, America, being a country of immigrants, will never allow us to be the majority party.â \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hispanic and Latino American politics in the United States', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7126155'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'QgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7126672', 'text': 'Mariano\\n\\nMariano is a masculine name from the Romance languages, corresponding to the feminine Mariana.\\n\\nIt is an Italian, Spanish and Portuguese variant of the Roman Marianus which derived from Marius, and Marius derived from the Roman god Mars (see also Ares) or from the Latin \"maris\" \"male\".\\n\\nMariano and Marian are sometimes seen as a conjunction of the two female names Mary and Ann. This name is an homage to The Virgin Mary, Mother of Jesus.\\n\\nMariano, as a surname, is of Italian, Spanish and Portuguese origin from the personal name \"Mariano\", from the Latin family name \"Marianus\" (a derivative of the ancient personal name \"Marius\", of Etruscan origin). In the early Christian era it came to be taken as an adjective derived from \"Maria\", and was associated with the cult of the Virgin Mary. It was borne by various early saints, including a 3rd-century martyr in Numibia and a 5th-century hermit of Berry, France. It is also a Sephardic Jewish surname derived from the term Merano. The term, which is frequently derived from the New Testament phrase \"maran atha\" (\"our Lord hath come\"), denotes in Spanish \"damned,\" \"accursed,\" \"banned\"; also \"hog,\" and in Portuguese it is used as an opprobrious epithet of the Jews because they do not eat pork.

It is the first album to feature Dean Butterworth on drums, who joined the band in March 2005 after former drummer Chris Wilson departed in 2005. Billy Martin has mentioned in an interview that Benji Madden came up with the name for the album. This style can be heard in the album\\'s third single, \"Dance Floor Anthem\", which is the most successful song on the album by debuting at No. 2 on the Australian charts and reaching No.25 on the \"Billboard\" Hot 100. It is the final album by Good Charlotte to be released through Daylight Records; they subsequently signed a deal with Capitol.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nIn March 2005, the band went on a UK tour. While on this tour, the band were working on new material on their tour bus. Vocalist Joel Madden expressed an interest to move beyond three-chord song structures, as first displayed on \"The Chronicles of Life and Death\". Guitarist Billy Martin has kept this in mind while writing the majority of the material. At this point, Madden reckoned they had anywhere from a quarter to half an album\\'s worth of songs. In May, drummer Chris Wilson left the group and was replaced by Dean Butterworth. The group met him through John Feldmann of Goldfinger. In August, the band revealed they would be recording later in the year with producer Eric Valentine. Madden had been revisiting acts he used to enjoy, such as Oasis, the Police and the Clash. He also mentioned that it would feature a large amount of keyboards, played by Martin.\\n\\nUp to this point, they had 12 songs written, and had plans to go into pre-production in November and record in December. Instead, they took a break to focus on their personal lives. Martin worked on painting while the Madden brothers spent time producing other acts and DJing. They eventually got the urge to work again and reconvened in February 2006. The band reconnected with Don Gilmore, who produced their first album, and showed him the 50 songs they had written. Gilmore was dismissive of all of the material, except for \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\".\\n\\nDave Massey, executive vice president of A&R at Sony Music Labels Group and Gilmore proposed that they reinvent themselves; a view the Madden brothers also shared. Massey said: \"[They] wrote some very promising early songs, but both Don and myself really wanted to push the envelop as to what could be achieved\". Gilmore recommended that the Madden brothers needed to escape from the Los Angeles scene in order to focus on the songs, suggesting Vancouver, Canada. Vancouver\\'s picturesque environment was used as inspiration, and over the course of seven weeks, they wrote a new batch of songs. The group were anxious and scared about impressing Gilmore; after they wrote \"Victims of Love\", Joel Madden said they \"felt like \\'OK, now we\\'re definitely on to something new and different.\\'\"\\n\\nSection::::Recording.\\nEvery two weeks, the band would get together and show each other the songs they had. All of the ones they liked, they made demos of. They eventually demoed around 40 from the Madden brothers, 12 from Martin and five from bassist Paul Thomas. The demos were sent in batches of ten to Gilmore, who would often respond saying he only liked one of the tracks. Gilmore challenged the band to write new material that was different for them. The group demoed another 30 songs before they began recording the final choices in July. The band had previously met with a number of producers, but eventually went with Gilmore due to his helpful comments on the demos.\\n\\nSessions took place at Armoury Studios and The Warehouse in Vancouver, and at NRG Recording Studios in Los Angeles, California. Recording was handled by Mark Kiczula with assistant engineer Fox Phelps. Martin used his Paul Reed Smith guitar for 3/4s of recording, while the remaining quarter was done with a John 5 Telecaster. They were played through Mesa Boogie and Dual Rectifiers heads connected to Marshall amplifiers. He used a Eventide H3000 Harmonizer effects pedal on nearly all of the songs. Benji Madden played Ernie Ball running through JCM heads connected to Marshall amplifiers.\\n\\nThe band were conversing with Avenged Sevenfold during the MTV Video Music Awards and invited them to the studio to hear the album. Joel Madden queried if they wanted to appear on a song, and picked \"The River\". M. Shadows lends his vocals and Synyster Gates contributed a guitar solo to the track. Bobbie Page, Terry Wood, Maxine Waters and Carmen Carter sung backing vocals on \"All Black\". The Incognito Horns played horns on \"Broken Hearts Parade\". BC Smith and Bart Hendrickson did programming. Sessions concluded on September 14, and the recordings were sent for mixing three days later. They were mixed by Andy Wallace at Soundtrack Studios in New York City. John O\\'Mahony served as Pro Tools engineer with assistance from Mike Scielzi. Ted Jensen mastered the recordings at Sterling Sound in New York City.\\n\\nSection::::Composition.\\nThe group wanted to move away from the dark overtones of their past work. Joel Madden said that since their contemporaries\\' music was \"getting really dramatic\", they decided to move into dance-orientated territory, incorporating hip hop and dance elements into their pop punk sound. The album features a heavy use of keyboards compared to \"The Chronicles of Life and Death\". According to Martin, they toyed with keyboards a bit on \"Chronicles\", which everyone enjoyed. As a result, when writing for \"Good Morning Revival\", Martin would work on an idea with a keyboard instead of his guitar. Madden said Butterwoth was important to the making of the album, saying he was from a \"different school\" of drumming. Martin said the album\\'s title is meant to \"represent a fresh kind of starting over\". Discussing \"Misery\", Madden said they lived in a \"world full of distraction, and no one is supposed to be sad or feel anything but great and happy and do whatever it takes to be happy\".\\n\\n\"The River\" talks about people who get involved in the lifestyle of Los Angeles and lose their identity as a result. Madden said \"Dance Floor Anthem\" was a break-up song that encouraged someone to \"Get out there and meet somebody, have a good time. â¦ Forget about it. Don\\'t buy into the drama.\" \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was inspired by DJ Junior Sanchez, who was a friend of Madden\\'s, after Sanchez taught Madden about DJ and dance culture. Madden had intended for the song to be released by Sanchez. However, it was included on the album after people were positive towards the song. Discussing \"Where Would We Be Now\", \"Break Apart Her Heart\" and \"Something Else\", Joel Madden said \"Love is a big part of me and I\\'ve accepted that and it\\'s in my music. And I\\'m not afraid to just show it.\" \"Beautiful Place\" was written by Benji Madden while he was in Mexico. When Butterworth laid down a drum track for it, the drums became part of the hook. Madden said \"March On\" was partially inspired by the Cardigans\\' \"Lovefool\".\\n\\nSection::::Release.\\nIn mid-September, \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was posted on the group\\'s website. In September and October, the group went on a headlining club tour with The Pink Spiders. In December, the group filmed a music video for \"The River\" in Los Angeles, California with director Marc Webb. It features the Los Angeles River, which Benji Madden said was symbolic in that \"it\\'s concrete, polluted, graffitied, and when you think of \\'baptism in the river\\' [the chorus of the song], you think peaceful and serene\". Joel Madden said in an interview with MuchMusic that the album release has been pushed back to early March 2007. In January 2007, the Madden brothers went on a promotional South Pacific tour. On January 15, \"The River\" was released to radio. The following day, a music video was released for \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\", directed by Marvin Scott Jarrett.\\n\\nThe music video for \"The River\" premiered on TV on February 5. It featured performance scenes next to the Los Angeles river, mixed in footage of other places in Los Angeles. To promote the video, the band partnered with Bix.com to create a web portal that allowed their fans to upload pictures that could be incorporated in the background of the video. These customized clips could then be sent to friends and appear on social networking platforms. \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" was released as a CD single in Australia on February 24 with a Broken Spindles remix and music video of the track, an acoustic version of \"I Just Wanna Live\" and \"Face the Strange\" as B-sides. \"Good Morning Revival\" was released on March 27 through Epic and Daylight Records. Physical retailers, such as Target, Best Buy, Circuit City and Walmart, were each given exclusive bonus tracks, as did digital retailer iTunes. The Australian edition featured a DVD, which included \"The River\" music, a making-of video, and an EPK.\\n\\n\"Dance Floor Anthem\" was released as a CD single in Australia on June 30 with radio and album versions of the song and a Brass Knuckles remix of \"Keep Your Hands off My Girl\" as B-sides. Also included was the music video to \"Dance Floor Anthem\", which was filmed in Canada and directed by Sean Michael Turrell. The band supported Justin Timberlake on the US leg of his FutureSex/LoveShow tour in August and September. In October, the group on a tour of Australia. \"Misery\" was released as a CD single in Australia on December 12 with a live version of the track as a B-side. \"Where Would We Be Now\" was released to US radio on May 20, 2008. In July and August, the group went on a co-headlining US tour with Boys Like Girls, with support from Metro Station and the Maine, dubbed the Soundtrack of Your Summer tour. Benji Madden posted an outtake \"No Communication\" from the album sessions on their website in May 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nInitial critical response to \"Good Morning Revival\" has been mostly mixed, with a score of 45/100 points on review aggregator site Metacritic, indicating \"mixed or average reviews\". The New York Times gave the album a negative review, calling it \"a mystifyingly inept CD that includes some of the worst lyrics you will â or, with any luck, wonât â hear all year.\" The Guardian said \"\"Revival\" is a fourth album of stunning fatuousness.\" Dr Dave De Sylvia of Sputnikmusic said \"Good Morning Revival is inconsistent; downright sinful at times, it contains sparks of brilliance and some very creditable pop moments.\" \"Alternative Press\" said \"Good Charlotte have become caricatures of themselves\". \"NOW Magazine\" said \"After years and years of hating every ounce of Maryland\\'s mall-punk icons Good Charlotte, it seems now that the actual trick to enjoying their music on any plausible level is to go into the whole thing with absolutely no expectations. Not even low expectations. Nothing.\" However, \"Billboard\" was positive of the album, calling it \"an album that proves being rich and famous doesn\\'t always blunt a band\\'s creative appetite.\"\\n\\n\"Entertainment Weekly\" placed the album at number 4 on their list of worst albums of 2007. By May 2008, the album had sold 284,000 copies in the US. In 2016, Benji Madden said of the album: \"This was when we either could have quit or do what we did. â¦ We could have tried to make The Young And The Hopeless again, but that, to me, would have been giving up\" Later that year, Joel Madden said it was his favorite Good Charlotte album, and that \"people donât give it the credit it needs, as a record and for where we were at for our age. I think we really put together a body of work that was cohesive.\"\\n\\nSection::::Track listing.\\nAll songs by Benji Madden, Joel Madden and Don Gilmore, except where noted.\\n\\n\\nBonus tracks\\n\\nSection::::Personnel.\\nPersonnel per booklet.\\nGood Charlotte\\n\\nAdditional musicians\\n\\nProduction\\nSection::::Chart positions.\\nThe album has achieved spots on album charts in many countries.

The story holds that suspecting his imminent arrest, Polubotok secretly deposited 200,000 gold coins (chervonets) in the Bank of England, under 7.5% annual interest. The amount, the bank, and the interest vary in different versions: some sources cite two barrels of gold, or 2.5% annual interest, or the Bank of the British East India Company. In his will, Polubotok allegedly bequeathed eighty percent of the gold to a future independent Ukraine, and the rest to his successors.\\n\\nSection::::Russian investigation and recovery attempts.\\nThe story first became widely known in 1907, when it was published in the Russian journal \"New Time\" by Professor Alexander Rubets. In 1908 the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Russia ordered the issue to be investigated by the Russian Consulate in London. Specifically, their unclaimed deposits at the Bank of England over the previous 200 years were investigated, and were found to total less than the alleged amount of Polubotok\\'s fortune.\\n\\nIn August 1913 a group of 170 individuals was met in Starodub, Chernihiv region who called themselves the offspring of Polubotok. However, none of the offspring were able to documentarily provide the bonifide documents regarding their relationship to Polubotok nor provide any information regarding the account at the Bank of England.\\n\\nSection::::Ukrainian Soviet recovery attempts.\\nA relative - Ostap Polubotok was however found in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil. In 1922 he met up with the Ukrainian Soviet Consul - Yuri Kotsubinsky in Vienna and had with him a copy of the 200-year-old document attesting to his legacy.\\n\\nKotsubynsky approached Hryhory Petrovsky with a plan for the recovery of the fortune.\\n\\nIn July 1922 a meeting took place between Ostap Polubotok, Robert Mitchell (from the Bank of England and because of Kotsubynsky\\'s ailment Consul Peter in Maria-Esensdorf outside of Vienna.\\n\\nThe matter however came to a halt with the removal and repression of Petrovsky and Kotsubynsky.\\n\\nSection::::Soviet investigation and recovery attempts.\\nOn January 22, 1960 under the Dwight Eisenhower administration the United States proclaimed Ukraine Day. The Soviet KGB reported that England had given money to support this propagandist action and that the money had come from the Polubotok bank account. The matter came to the attention of Nikita Khrushchev who initiated an investigation to recover the money. A commission as set up which included historians - Dr Olena Kompan, and Dr Olena Apanovych.\\n\\nIn January 1968 Olena Apanovych published her findings in a paper read at the Presidium. She was later asked not to discuss this \"state secret\".\\n\\nAccording to the investigators on 22 May 1723 Polubotok received a summons to appear in Petersburg. Polubotok thought that the matter was related to his son\\'s secret meeting with Pylyp Orlyk in France. Polubotok began his trip to the Russian capital 13 July 1723. It accompanied two huge carts of \"salt\" and \"salted fish\". The carts continued to Arkhangelsk and were put onto an English frigate from where the gold was sent to London.\\n\\nThe cargo was met in London by Polobotok\\'s son and Pylyp Orlyk and the gold was deposited into the Bank of England with two copies of Polubotok\\'s instructions in Latin. These two documents remain in the Bank of England today.\\n\\nIn the chaotic time of the Soviet Union\\'s collapse, the story again attracted public attention. In May 1990, Ukrainian poet Volodymyr Tsybulko announced that if the gold were returned, it would amount to 38 kilograms for each citizen of independent Ukraine. This astronomical figure, about twenty times the world\\'s gold reserve, was achieved due to compounding of interest over 270 years. The heated interest in the Polubotok treasury coincided with a visit to Kiev on June 9, 1990 of British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher. The Ukrainian parliament ordered the creation of a special committee headed by the Vice Prime Minister of Ukraine, Dr. Petro Tronko, which visited London. The gold, however, has not been found. Recently, poet Tsybulko confessed that his speech in 1990 was propagandistic.\\n\\nSection::::Outcomes.\\nThe legend of Polubotok\\'s gold was made into a comic film.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Gold of Polubotok', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7131965'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7133957', 'text': 'Refugio Independent School District\\n\\nRefugio Independent School District is a public school district based in Refugio, Texas (USA).\\n\\nLocated in Refugio County, a small portion of the district extends into Bee and Victoria counties.\\n\\nIn 2009, the school district was rated \"academically acceptable\" by the Texas Education Agency.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Athletics.\\nOn December 16th, 2011 the Refugio Bobcats were victorious in the State Title game against the Cisco Loboes.

Racial divide in her neighborhood also prevented Tyus from playing with the white girls that lived nearby and as the nearest black family lived almost a mile away, Tyus spent most of her time playing sports with her brothers and the white boys in the neighborhood. As she grew older her father helped to solidify the idea that she could accomplish anything in her life, but not without hard work to overcome racial stigma.\\n\\nAfter finishing high school Tyus attended Tennessee State University (TSU), making her the first of her family to go to college. While at TSU Tyus participated in the Tigerbelles collegiate team. Tyus began training with TSU coach Ed Temple, however poor grades, study habits, and a general lack of interest in her classes nearly derailed her chances to continue her training and attend the 1964 Olympics. She has credited her training with Coach Temple as helping with her development and success in her sports, academic, and professional life, especially as he highlighted the struggle that comes with being a black athlete and having to work harder to receive positive recognition.\\n\\nIn December 1968 Tyus moved with her then boyfriend from Georgia to California, where she worked as a substitute teacher. She married her boyfriend in 1969 and held multiple jobs until becoming a teacher in 1971. Tyus left this job within a year in order to stay at home with her first child. Tyus\\'s first marriage ended in 1974 and in 1978 she married Duane Tillman, with whom she had her second child, a son.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Wyomia Tyus', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71386'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7141188', 'text': \"Frank Padavan\\n\\nFrank Padavan (October 31, 1934 â October 8, 2018) was an American engineer and politician.

Lord Vlad Luciferian was later ejected from the group due to internal differences. Although the band says their lyrical themes are simply \"anti-JewishChristian and/or anti-religion\", they have been accused of far-right and racist views. Gelal Necrosodomy has responded to these accusations by stating \"black metal to me is paganism, and paganism is neo-fascism, and neo-fascism is anti-christian, and anti-christianity is black metal. It is a circle that cannot be altered for everything fits in perfectly.\"\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Early history (1992-1996).\\nThe band started in 1992 with Gelal on guitars, bass guitar and keyboards, and Bestial Luciferian on drums and vocals. By the end of the year, they recorded their debut demo, \"Goat of a Thousand Young\". The next year, they played their first concert with Kommando on bass (from Arghoslent) and Tom Philips (from While Heaven Wept) on keyboards as guests. After the show, Gelal quit the band due to his animosity toward Bestial Luciferian. The band soon split up, but Bestial Luciferian (now Lord Vlad Luciferian) tried to reform GBK, bringing with him Demonic on bass. Tom Philips was set to replace Gelal before Demonic convinced him to rejoin. This lineup then recorded the \"Triumph of the Hordes\" demo in 1994.\\n\\nAfter the release of the demo, Gelal and Demonic learned that Lord Vlad Luciferian added female voices to one of the songs without asking, and that he had messed up deals with several record companies. Gelal, now even more angry towards Lord Vlad Luciferian, fired him from the band. After this, Demonic quit the band due to lack of time, so Gelal asked The Marauder (guitar player of Arghoslent at the time) to play bass, and recruited The Black Lourde of Crucifixion on drums/vocals (Cazz Grant from Crucifier). This was the lineup which recorded the \"A Witness to the Regicide\" EP in 1996.\\n\\nSection::::\"Mocking the Philanthropist\" (1997-2000).\\nThe next LP made GBK one of the most controversial underground black metal acts in the United States. Bassist Der Sturmer (Der StÃ¼rmer was the name of a Nazi newspaper published 1923-1945) replaced the Marauder, and the new lineup recorded the LP \"Mocking the Philanthropist\" on the Belgian record label Wood-Nymph. The CD booklet contained pictures of the band wearing shirts of far-right bands (Bound for Glory and Spear of Longinus), leading to tour boycotts and other problems. In their first nine years, GBK had only played nine gigs. The album was refused distribution in Germany due to the allegedly offensive booklet. Wood-Nymph refused to print a new booklet and, as a result, the label soon folded due to the poor distribution of the album. The CD would later be repressed by Morbidund Cult and Drakkar Productions in 2004 and 2006 respectively.\\n\\nSection::::Judeobeast Assassination to Kosherat (2001-2005).\\nThe follow-up to \"Mocking the Philanthropist\" was \"Judeobeast Assassination\", released in 2001. The album\\'s lyrics focused on the inseparability of Judeo-Christianity, mocking both the New Testament and the Old Testament (\"Mocking the Philanthropist\" had focused only on the New Testament). The lyrics were much more provocative and sexually perverse than the ones on \"Mocking the Philanthropist\". The music on the album had a more bass-heavy mix and a thicker sound, something relatively uncommon in Black Metal. The album was almost twenty minutes shorter, in order to fit onto a piece of vinyl.\\n\\nIn 2002, The Black Lourde of Crucifixion left GBK to focus more on Crucifier, and he wasn\\'t interested in touring Europe. The lineup for the \"Pimps of Gennesarret Tour\" was Grimnir Wotansvolk on vocals, Gelal Necrosodomy on guitar, Demonic on bass, and the Gulag on drums; the same lineup that would record \"Kosherat\" in 2005. \"Kosherat\" was released in 2005 on Drakkar Productions, and would be the band\\'s final album before their disbandment. The album featured the new lineup of Grimnir Wotansvolk (later changed to Grimnir Heretik) on vocals, Gelal Necrosodomy on guitar, Demonic on bass, and the Gulag on drums. The album\\'s central focus was on pre-Christian Judaism, mocking such rituals as the Red Heifer and male circumcision. The album also featured three re-recorded tracks from their vinyl EPs, as well as two Chaos 88 covers.\\n\\nSection::::Recent history (2006-present).\\nVocalist Richard P. Mills died in 2006 of drug overdose. Mills, who also went by the names Grimnir Wotansvolk and G. Heretik, was the grandson of horse breeder Alice du Pont Mills, and was the owner of the National Socialist black metal record label and distributor Vinland Winds. He released Pantheon\\'s \"Ergriffenheit\" 10\" vinyl record as well as Spear of Longinus and Graveland vinyl records. The label\\'s last release was an exclusive US release of Russian far-right thrash metal band Corrosia Metalla in 2008. The same year, the last GBK recordings were released as a split album with Absurd from Germany and Sigrblot from Sweden; the tracks were recorded during the same session as the \"Kosherat\" album and were \"exclusively planned for this split\".\\n\\nThe band became active again as of 2009. In December 2009, they played Chicago\\'s Hooligan Black Metal show, along with Heathen Hammer, Martial and Absurd. The band also performed at Hell\\'s Headbash III in September 2016.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': \"Grand Belial's Key\", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7143336'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '714771', 'text': 'GÇui dialect\\n\\nGÇui or GÇwi (pronounced in English, and also spelled \"ÇGwi, Dcui, Gcwi,\" or \"Cgui\") is a Khoe dialect of Botswana with 2,500 speakers (2004 Cook). It is part of the GÇana dialect cluster, and is closely related to Naro. It has a number of loan words from ÇÊ¼Amkoe. GÇui, ÇÊ¼Amkoe, and Taa form the core of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund, and share a number of characteristic features, including extremely large consonant inventories.\\n\\nSection::::Phonology.\\nGÇui has 89 consonants (with 52 clicks) or 52 consonants (and 20 clicks), depending on analysis. There are ten vowels, and two to six tones, again depending on analysis.\\n\\nSection::::Clicks.\\nGÇui has 24 simple click consonants, plus complex clicks variously analyzed as consonant clusters or airstream contours. As with many of the TshuâKhwe languages, clicks have lost some of their importance under the influence of neighboring Bantu languages. Many words which previously began with clicks (as shown by cognates in related languages) have lost them over the past few centuries in GÇui. Nonetheless, GÇui has the largest known inventory of clicks of any Khoe language.\\n\\nGÇui has been described with a contrast between velar and uvular clicks. However, all GÇui clicks are uvular (or pharyngeal); the \\'uvular\\' part of the latter is part of an airstream contour, a transition from a click to a non-click release: effectively, the click transitions into a non-click consonant. (See NÇng language for a similar situation in another language.) Nakagawa proposes that the contour and glottalized clicks are not single sounds, but sequences of a click and a uvular or glottal consonant, though Miller (2011) notes that such an analysis creates problems when extended to other languages with clicks.\\n\\nAltogether there are thirteen such series, or \"accompaniments\", and all 52 possible combinations are found. Except for the lack of bilabial clicks, the inventory is nearly identical to that of some speakers of ÇÊ¼Amkoe, which is in intense contact with GÇui and may have borrowed some of its clicks from GÇui, and lost others not found in GÇui.\\n\\nMiller (2011), in a comparative study with other languages, interprets Nakagawa\\'s description as follows. (Nakagawa\\'s and are analyzed as and , respectively.)\\nThe voiced contour (\\'uvular\\') clicks tend to be prenasalized, .\\nAs in the majority of languages with clicks, the glottalized nasal series are pronounced with a glottal release in initial position, and prenasalized after a vowel. The contrast between glottalized oral and glottalized nasal clicks is unusual, but has also been reported from ÇÊ¼Amkoe and Yeyi since Nakagawa announced its discovery in GÇui. The Khute dialect of GÇui also has preglottalized nasal clicks allophonically. They developed from glottalized nasal clicks before pharyngealized vowels, perhaps under ÇÊ¼Amkoe influence:\\n\\nSection::::Other consonants.\\nMost words are of the form CV, CVV, CVCV, CVN, where C stands for a consonant, V for a vowel, and N for a nasal consonant (m, n). In CVCV words, only a limited set of consonants () may occur in medial position (the second syllable). Of these, two () may not occur at the beginning of a word, and due to restrictions with nasal vowels may be argued to be allophonic. The is pronounced after a lateral click or a pharyngeal vowel (but not after a velar ejective ). only occurs in mimesis. occurs in a single word, \"t\\'aa\" \\'to carve\\', which is not widely known.\\n\\nThe palatals, which are unique among Khoisan languages to GÇana-GÇui, derive historically from the alveolars before non-pharyngealized vowels. In GÇana this shift has only partly occurred.\\n\\nSection::::Vowels.\\nGÇui has five modal vowels, , three nasal vowels, , and two pharyngeal vowels, . There are diphthongs and , but they are allophones of . GÇui also has breathy-voice vowels, but they are described as part of the tone system.\\n\\nOnly the five modal vowels occur in monomoraic (CV or V) roots, which except for the noun \"ÏÃ²\" \\'thing, place, case\\' are all grammatical morphemes. These are reduced to three nasal vowels after nasal consonants, including the glottalized nasal clicks.\\n\\nThe modal vowels and the pharyngeal vowels, , occur as the first vowel (V1) of bimoraic roots, CVCV, CVV, and CVN, though the modal vowels are reduced to before a nasal coda, CVN. This corresponds to in GÇana. Pharyngeal and are also in complementary distribution: in CVV words and in CVCV and CVN words; some speakers use in CVV roots too, so that their pharyngeal vowels are reduced to .\\n\\nThe modal and nasal vowels (but not the pharyngeals) occur as the second vowel (V2) of bimoraic roots, CVCV or CVV, though only modal vowels may follow the medial consonants , and only nasal vowels follow the medial consonants . Either oral or nasal vowels may follow or null (CVV roots). That is, medial may be seen as allophones of .\\n\\nThe initial consonant (C1) may be any but . The medial consonant (C2) may be . N may be .\\n\\nThere are other vowel restrictions. V1 is always i in CVCV words when C1 is non-click palatal, for example. (This is because those sounds arose historically from alveolars followed by , which are still found in Naro.) Uvular(ized) consonants cause vowel lowering.\\n\\nSection::::Tone.\\nGÇui may be analyzed as having two abstract phonemic tones, plus breathy voice, which is covered here rather than under vowels.\\n\\nMonosyllabic morphemes carry one of two tones, high and low. Bimoraic roots carry one of six tones: high-level, high-mid (or \"high falling\"), mid-low (or \"mid\"), low-mid dipping/rising, high falling (or \"falling\"), and low falling (or \"low\"). Low falling and low-mid are accompanied by a breathy voice phonation, the other four with a clear phonation. The high and low falling tones form a natural class, triggering for example a high tone on the suffix -si, whereas the other four root tones trigger a low tone on -si.\\n\\nThat is, there are two tones or CV and V roots; two tones on bimoraic roots with breathy vowels, one of them falling; and four tones on bimoraic roots with other vowels, one of them falling. Thus there are four phonemic tones on CVCV, CVV, and CVN roots, the number expected if there are two possible tones on each mora, with moraic N carrying tone, though their contours are not simple juxtapositions of high/low + high/low.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'GÇui dialect', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=714771'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7152031', 'text': 'Killing machine\\n\\nKilling machine may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Killing machine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7152031'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'UAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7152303', 'text': \"Eivind Aadland\\n\\nEivind Aadland (born 19 September 1956) is a Norwegian conductor and violinist.

The world the characters inhabit is one more technologically advanced than our own, but also home to the strange and supernatural. Beyond the comic itself, the world of The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen is expanded upon by supplemental prose material, including \"The New Traveller\\'s Almanac\", \"Allan and the Sundered Veil\", and the documents from the \"\".\\n\\nSection::::The British Isles.\\nIn the \"Black Dossier\", the alternate history of the League\\'s United Kingdom is explored in depth. As in medieval Welsh Mythology, in approximately 1100 BC, Brutus of Troy founds the kingdom of Britain (then called Brutain) with the capital at New Troy. He is accompanied by the ageless and gender swapping , who aids Brutus in subduing Brutain\\'s population of savage giants and their chieftain, Gogmagog. In 43 AD Britain is invaded by the Roman Empire under Claudius. In 363, the year of Merlin\\'s birth, the Emperor Julian declares Britain a pagan nation. In 410 the Romans withdrew, and Uther Pendragon rose to power. Circa 450, his son Arturus became king, ruling until 468. Britain descended into barbarism, plagued by ogres, giants, and faeries ruled by Arthur\\'s half-sister Morgana. The faerie remained a powerful force in Britain, so much so that King Henry VIII took the second cousin of King Oberon of the Faerie, the polydactyl Faery-blooded Anne Boleyn, as his wife. From this union sprang Queen Gloriana the First, who reigned from 1558 to 1603. Under her rule, magical and otherworldly forces became more popular in Britain. Her court held such notables as Johannes Suttle, Edward Face, Sir Jack Wilton, and Sir Basildon Bond (ancestor to Campion and James Bond). Gloriana was also the patron and associate of William Shakespeare.\\n\\nAfter her death, the puritanical magic hater King Jacob the First ascended to the throne, and proceeded to purge the faerie and other supernatural races from Britain, resulting in the faerie kingdom cutting all ties with the human world by 1616. It was also under Jacob\\'s rule that the King Jacob Bible was compiled. Beginning in 1610, Prospero, by order of a decree written by Gloriana before her death, began to assemble the first \\'League\\' of extraordinary individuals to defend Britain. The group disbanded when Prospero returned to the Blazing World, but was succeeded by similar groups in the 1740s, early 19th century, 1890s, early 20th century, and a failed group in the 1950s.\\n\\nIn the late 1890s the United Kingdom was attacked by Martian invaders, who were defeated via germ warfare. The nation went on to fight in World War I and against the Germany of Adenoid Hynkel in World War II. After the war, General Sir Harold Wharton, an agent implanted by rogue factions of MI5 into the Labour Party, took power and turned the United Kingdom into a communist dictatorship. Under Wharton\\'s Ingsoc government, cameras monitored citizens\\' daily activities, torture of dissidents was widespread, and a reduced and simplified version of English known as Newspeak was made the official language of the state. After Wharton\\'s death in 1952, he was succeeded by Gerald O\\'Brien. O\\'Brien was unable to maintain power, and conceded to the Conservative Party\\'s demands to be reinstated as an official party. Soon after he was voted out of office, and most of the Ingsoc government\\'s programs were reversed.

VPython allows users to create objects such as spheres and cones in 3D space and displays these objects in a window. This makes it easy to create simple visualizations, allowing programmers to focus more on the computational aspect of their programs. The simplicity of VPython has made it a tool for the illustration of simple physics, especially in the educational environment.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn 1985, the cT programming language was created by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University. Contributors to the project included David Andersen, Bruce Sherwood, Judith Sherwood, and Kevin Whitley. The cT programming language was largely spawned from the TUTOR (1965) and the MicroTutor (1977) programming languages. Although cT had many applications, its primary usage was 2D graphics for the classroom setting. cT was used for a variety of purposes, but its main niche was the creation of programs for education. Many prize-winning educational programs were written in cT (see VISQ), especially in the area of physics. In 1997, students at Carnegie Mellon were taught cT in a new introductory physics course created by Ruth Chabay and Bruce Sherwood.\\n\\nIn 1998, David Scherer entered the university as a freshman and enrolled in one of the introductory physics classes that used cT. Although cT offered a relatively easy 2D graphics programming environment, Scherer saw the possibility of creating an even better tool. In the spring and summer of 2000, with the assistance of David Andersen, Ruth Chabay, Ari Heitner, Ian Peters, and Bruce Sherwood, Scherer created Visual, a module for Python that was not only easier to use than the cT programming language, but also rendered objects in three dimensions. The combination of Python plus Visual is called VPython. Further development of the cT programming language was ended and the newly created VPython was used in its place. Since VPython\\'s creation, several versions have been released to the public.\\n\\nIn 2016, developers announced that classic VPython would no longer be developed. Instead, development will concentrate on Glowscript and Jupyter implementations of the language.\\n\\nSection::::Usage.\\nVPython is a simple rendering tool for 3D objects and graphs. Its main use has been in education, but it has also been used in commercial or research settings. VPython was first used in introductory physics courses at Carnegie Mellon and then spread to other universities and eventually high schools, especially in connection with the Matter & Interactions curriculum.\\n\\nA related development due to David Scherer and Bruce Sherwood is GlowScript, which makes it possible to write and run VPython programs in a browser, including on mobile devices, thanks to the RapydScript Python-to-JavaScript compiler, created by Alexander Tsepkov. Programs can be written, run, and stored at glowscript.org, and the compiled-to-JavaScript code can be exported and embedded in one\\'s own web page. John Coady has created the ivisual version for use in the IPython, now Jupyter environment, using the GlowScript WebGL graphics libraries to render 3D output in an IPython/Jupyter notebook. Rhett Allain in his Wired blog shows an example of using Trinkets to embed both editable VPython source code and 3D execution in one\\'s own web page.\\n\\nSection::::Objects.\\nSee the article on Python for Python syntax. This article will address several of the objects that are VPython specific. Click here for the complete documentation. The cylinder object is a good example of a simple VPython object. Here is an example of a simple cylinder as given in VPython\\'s documentation (in older VPython implementations, the module to import is \"vpython\", not \"visual\"):\\n\\nSome similar objects offered by the VPython 3D rendering engine are the cone, sphere, and box objects. In addition to solid objects, VPython offers graphing tools as well.

It is commonly used in failure analysis and non-destructive evaluation. It also has applications in biological and medical research. The semiconductor industry has found the SAM useful in detecting voids, cracks, and delaminations within microelectronic packages.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe first scanning acoustic microscope was developed in 1974 by R. A. Lemons and C. F. Quate at the Microwave Laboratory of Stanford University. Since then, many improvements to such systems have been made to enhance resolution and accuracy.\\n\\nSection::::Principles of operation.\\nScanning acoustic microscopy works by directing focused sound from a transducer at a small point on a target object. Sound hitting the object is either scattered, absorbed, reflected (scattered at 180Â°) or transmitted (scattered at 0Â°). It is possible to detect the scattered pulses travelling in a particular direction. A detected pulse informs of the presence of a boundary or object. The `time of flight' of the pulse is defined as the time taken for it to be emitted by an acoustic source, scattered by an object and received by the detector, which is usually coincident with the source. The time of flight can be used to determine the distance of the inhomogeneity from the source given knowledge of the speed through the medium.\\n\\nBased on the measurement, a value is assigned to the location investigated. The transducer (or object) is moved slightly and then insonified again. This process is repeated in a systematic pattern until the entire region of interest has been investigated. Often the values for each point are assembled into an image of the object. The contrast seen in the image is based either on the object's geometry or material composition. The resolution of the image is limited either by the physical scanning resolution or the width of the sound beam (which in turn is determined by the frequency of the sound).\\n\\nSection::::Applications.\\nSection::::Device testing.\\nSAM is used for counterfeit detection, product reliability testing, process validation, vendor qualification, quality control, failure analysis, research, and development. Detecting discontinuities in silicon is just one of the ways scanning acoustic microscopy is being used for testing in the semiconductor market.\\n\\nSection::::Medicine and biology.\\nSAM can provide data on the elasticity of cells and tissues, which can give useful information on the physical forces holding structures in a particular shape and the mechanics of structures such as the cytoskeleton. These studies are particularly valuable in investigating processes such as cell motility.\\n\\nSome work has also been performed to assess penetration depth of particles injected into skin using needle-free injection \\n\\n\", 'title': 'Scanning acoustic microscope', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7168569'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'WgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '717108', 'text': 'Tara Spencer-Nairn\\n\\nTara Spencer-Nairn (born January 6, 1978) is a Canadian actress best known for her work on the television series \"Corner Gas\".\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nSpencer-Nairn was born in Montreal, Quebec, but raised in Vancouver, British Columbia.

As a young man he was a successful sports shooter, winning an individual bronze and a team gold in the free pistol event in the 1903 World Championship held in Buenos Aires. He would receive a team silver in the 1904 edition in Lyon, France. He was the founder of Argentina\\'s National Olympic Committee. As a politician he became the leader of the anti-personalistic faction of the centrist part of the Radical Civic Union (UCR) co-founded by Yrigoyen, opposed to some of president HipÃ³lito Yrigoyen\\'s policies. In contrast to Yrigoyen\\'s popular style, Alvear belonged to the self-appointed \"aristocracy\" of Buenos Aires and never tried to hide it. He married opera singer Regina Pacini. In 1917, he was appointed Ambassador to France.\\n\\nIn 1922, Argentina\\'s president HipÃ³lito Yrigoyen designated Alvear to be his successor. During his term, the economy of Argentina reached a peak performance, which would come to an abrupt halt due to the Great Depression shortly after his mandate ended.\\n\\nAfter the coup against Yrigoyen on September 6, 1930, Alvear gained control of the party and led the unsuccessful opposition to the conservative governments that followed, including the failed revolution of 1932. As a result, he was arrested and deported to Europe. Securing an agreement to the effect from President AgustÃ­n Justo in 1935, Alvear returned to Argentina, whereby he became the UCR\\'s nominee for the presidency. Encouraged by favorable results during mid-term elections in 1936, the UCR ran a vigorous campaign ahead of the 1937 presidential election.

She appears in the now non-canon \"Legends\" series, as the wife of Luke Skywalker and mother of Ben Skywalker. In the different video games, she has been voiced by Heidi Shannon, Edie Mirman and Kath Soucie. Despite not being part of the regular canon and never appearing in the film series, Mara is considered one of the most popular \"Star Wars\" characters.\\n\\nSection::::Concept and development.\\nMara Jade was introduced in the \"Star Wars Expanded Universe\", which Lucasfilm would later brand as non-canonical to the \" Star Wars\" franchise. Her first appearance was in Timothy Zahn\\'s \"Heir to the Empire\" (1991). Zahn imagined Jade as a strong, complex female character, which he found was lacking in the \"Star Wars\" universe. While competent, she is also flawed. When the \"Thrawn Trilogy\" ended in 1993 with \"The Last Command\", Zahn thought it was the last book for which he would develop the character. When he was asked to write another novel, he established two goals: \"to end the war between the New Republic and the Empire, and to get Luke Skywalker and Mara together.\" Although Lucasfilm initially resisted the idea of Luke marrying Mara, they eventually acquiesced.\\n\\nCompared to \"Star Wars\" sole iconic female character, Princess Leia, Zahn said, \"Mara has a sharper and more sarcastic manner, and of course, she had to go through the painful realization that her service had been to an evil cause. But they\\'re both women who are strong without sacrificing their femininity, a balance which I think some authors have trouble writing. Bear in mind too, that Leia was one of the first people in the New Republic who decided Mara could be trusted, which perhaps says something about their understanding of each other.\"\\n\\nIn 2006, Zahn called Mara and Grand Admiral Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created, saying that \"Mara, with her attitude and her Jedi skills, is just plain fun to write, especially when she\\'s in oppositionâor in partnershipâwith Luke.\" In a 1998 \"Star Wars Insider\" poll of fans\\' favorite \"Star Wars\" characters, Mara was the only expanded universe character to break the top 20.\\n\\nSection::::Appearances and depiction.\\nIn 2018, Zahn said that Lucasfilm had given him some creative control over the character of Mara Jade: any possible appearance of Mara in new works requires Zahn\\'s approval. Zahn also explained that the Lucasfilm Story Group also had the authority to prevent him from incorporating Mara back into the canon, and that any appearance would have to be approved by both parties. Zahn said that he would only allow her to appear if she plays an important role in the plot, and that he would block any kind of cameo. Previously, the character of Grand Admiral Thrawn, whom Zahn also created, had made the jump from \"Legends\" to canon, albeit with a slightly reworked story. Due to that, Zahn said that he hoped to find a way to bring Mara into the canon, stating \"If there was a generic, or organic, spot for her to fit into a story... I promise people, I will pitch it to the Lucasfilm story group, and then, it\\'s their decision whether to allow it or not.\"\\n\\nSection::::\"Legends\".\\nWith the 2012 acquisition of Lucasfilm by The Walt Disney Company, most of the licensed \"Star Wars\" novels and comics produced since the originating 1977 film \"Star Wars\" were rebranded as \"Star Wars Legends\" and declared non-canon to the franchise in April 2014.\\n\\nMara is introduced as smuggler Talon Karrde\\'s second-in-command in \"Heir to the Empire\". The novel establishes that she was previously an \"Emperor\\'s Hand\"âa special agentâfor Emperor Palpatine.\\n\\nSeveral stories depict Jade before the events in \"Heir to the Empire\", showing her training under Palpatine and executing his orders. The Thrawn trilogy depicts Mara\\'s first confrontation with Luke Skywalker, whom she has sworn to kill to avenge Palpatine\\'s death (Palpatine having sent her a faked image of Luke and Vader turning on him together, rather than Vader killing Palpatine on his own and the demand for Luke\\'s death simply motivated by Palpatine\\'s desire for revenge against his father rather than Luke himself having done anything). This was reinforced by the Emperor\\'s final telepathic command to assassinate Luke, which had plagued her thoughts since his death; upon learning this situation, Luke vowed to help Mara break Palpatine\\'s hold on her, regardless of the danger she posed to him. Towards the end of the trilogy, she turns against the Empire and resolves her anger toward Luke and silences the command without killing him, instead killing Luke\\'s \"clone\"â Luuke Skywalkerâ who had been made by the Dark Jedi Joruus C\\'baoth to challenge Luke. In doing so, she took Anakin Skywalker\\'s blue lightsaber (which Luuke was using), and used it instead of Luke\\'s green lightsaber to defeat C\\'baoth. At the close of \"The Last Command\", Luke gives her Anakin\\'s lightsaber not only because she had earned it, but because he truly wanted her to have it. Over the course of the series, Luke recognizes in Mara an underdeveloped affinity for the Force ; and although she initially resists Jedi training, she eventually becomes a Jedi Master.\\n\\nLuke and Mara develop a strong bond in Zahn\\'s \"The Hand of Thrawn Duology\"; he proposes marriage, and the two wed in Michael A. Stackpole\\'s graphic novel \"Union\". She delivers a son, Ben, during \"The New Jedi Order\" series.\\n\\nIn the \"Legacy of the Force\" series, Mara becomes suspicious of her nephew, Jacen Solo, when he sends Ben on several ethically dubious missions. Upon learning that Jacen has become a Sith apprentice, Mara vows to kill him, but Jacen ultimately kills \"her\" in \"Sacrifice\". She later appears as a Force ghost, first to Ben and then to Luke, in \"Revelation\". She also appears as a Force ghost to Cade Skywalker in the \"\" comics, set more than a century after the \"Star Wars\" films.\\n\\nMara also appears in the short story \"Sleight of Hand: The Tale of Mara Jade\", by Timothy Zahn, in the anthology \"Tales from Jabba\\'s Palace\". In this story, she infiltrates Jabba the Hutt\\'s palace as a dancing girl in order to assassinate Luke Skywalker under orders of the Emperor, but misses her chance when Jabba drops him into the Rancor\\'s lair and he escapes.\\n\\nSection::::Other appearances.\\nMara was portrayed by model Shannon McRandle (as Shannon Baksa) on several cards in the Star Wars Customizable Card Game.\\n\\nMeeting her was also a mission objective in the now defunct massively multiplayer online game \"Star Wars Galaxies\". She is a playable character in \",\". \"\", \"\" and \"\". She also narrates the Imperial campaign in \"\". \\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nMara Jade was chosen by IGN as the 19th top \"Star Wars\" character. IGN\\'s Jesse Schedeen also listed the character as the top 10th \"Star Wars\" hero, noting that she \"entered the Expanded Universe early, and she\\'s stuck around for so long because she\\'s just a great character\". UGO Networks called the character the seventh top \"Star Wars\" Expanded Universe character, calling her complex. In 2006, Zahn called Mara and Thrawn his favorite characters out of those he created.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Mara Jade', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71789', 'cat_id': '71789', 'cat_title': \"Brazilian_BahÃÆÃÂ¡'ÃÆÃ\\xads\", 'cat_pages': '4', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718196', 'text': 'Albert Pujols\\n\\nJosÃ© Alberto Pujols AlcÃ¡ntara (born January 16, 1980) is a Dominican-American professional baseball first baseman and designated hitter for the Los Angeles Angels of Major League Baseball (MLB). He previously played 11 seasons for the St. Louis Cardinals, with whom he was a three-time National League (NL) Most Valuable Player (MVP) (, , ) and nine-time All-Star (2001, 2003â2010). He then was a one-time All-Star additionally with the Angels in 2015. A right-handed batter and thrower, Pujols stands tall and weighs .\\n\\nPujols was born in the Dominican Republic and moved to the United States in 1996. After one season of college baseball, he was selected by the Cardinals in the 13th round of the 1999 MLB draft. As a rookie for the Cardinals in 2001, he was unanimously voted the NL Rookie of the Year. Pujols played for the Cardinals, contributing to two World Series championships in and . After the 2011 season, Pujols became a free agent and signed a 10-year contract with the Angels.\\n\\nPujols was at the height of his career a highly regarded hitter who showed a \"combination of contact hitting ability, patience and raw power.\" He is a six-time Silver Slugger who has twice led the NL in home runs, and he has also led the NL once each in batting average, doubles and RBI. He is significantly above-average in career regular season batting average (.302), walk rate (10.9 percent) and Isolated Power (.252). He holds the MLB all-time record for most times grounded into a double play (376). With 14 seasons of 100 or more RBI produced, he is tied with Alex Rodriguez for the most in MLB history. Pujols got his 3,000th career hit in 2018, becoming the 32nd player in MLB history to do so. Pujols also became the fourth member of the 3,000-hit club to also hit 600 home runs, joining Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and Rodriguez in this exclusive club. He is a strong future candidate for the Hall of Fame.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nPujols was raised in Santo Domingo, Dominican Republic, mostly by his grandmother, America Pujols, and 10 of his uncles and aunts. He was an only child. His father, Bienvenido Pujols, was a softball pitcher, but he was also an alcoholic. Albert often had to take his father home when his father got drunk following the games. Growing up, Pujols practiced baseball using limes for balls and a milk carton for a glove. Pujols, his father and his grandmother immigrated in 1996 to New York City, where Albert witnessed a shooting at a grocery store. Partly because of the shooting, they moved to Independence, Missouri, two months later to join some relatives.\\n\\nPujols played baseball at Fort Osage High School in Independence and was named an All-State athlete twice. As a senior, he was walked 55 times in protest because opposing coaches believed he was older than 18, but he still hit eight home runs in 33 at bats. One of his home runs travelled 450 feet. After graduating from high school a semester early in December 1998, he was given a baseball scholarship to Maple Woods Community College. Pujols hit a grand slam and turned an unassisted triple play in the first game of his only college season. Playing shortstop, he batted .461 with 22 home runs as a freshman before deciding to enter the Major League Baseball (MLB) draft.\\n\\nSection::::Professional baseball career.\\nSection::::Minor league career.\\nFew teams were interested in Pujols because of uncertainty about his age, which position he would play, and his build. Tampa Bay Rays scout Fernando Arango recommended that his team sign Pujols, and quit his job when Tampa Bay failed to do so. Pujols was not drafted until the 13th round of the 1999 Major League Baseball (MLB) Draft, when the St. Louis Cardinals selected him with the 402nd overall pick. Pujols initially turned down a $10,000 bonus and spent the summer playing for the Hays Larks of the Jayhawk Collegiate League (a summer league in the National Baseball Congress); his total of 48 runs batted in (RBI) with the team was tied for ninth with Tyler Wasserman in Larks\\' history. When the Cardinals increased their bonus offer to $60,000, he signed.\\n\\nPujols began his minor league career in 2000 playing third base with the Peoria Chiefs of the single-A Midwest League. He batted .324 with 128 hits, 32 doubles, six triples, 17 home runs and 84 RBI, in 109 games. He finished second in the league in batting (behind Ryan Gripp), tied for ninth in doubles (with Andrew Beattie and Justin Leone), tied for fourth in triples (with six other players), tied for sixth in home runs (with Shawn McCorkle and Lance Burkhart) and sixth in RBI. He was voted the league\\'s Most Valuable Player and named to the All-Star team. Pujols also played 21 games with the Potomac Cannons in the high-A Carolina League that year, batting .284 with 23 hits, eight doubles, one triple, two home runs and 10 RBI. He finished the 2000 season with the Memphis Redbirds in the AAA Pacific Coast League (PCL), and after appearing in three regular season games with them, he batted .367 in the playoffs and was named the postseason Most Valuable Player (MVP) as the Redbirds won their first PCL title.\\n\\nSection::::St. Louis Cardinals (2001â2011).\\nSection::::Early career (2001â2003).\\nDuring spring training in 2001, incumbent first baseman Mark McGwire said to Cardinals manager Tony La Russa that if he did not promote Pujols to the major league roster, \"it might be one of the worst moves you make in your career.\" La Russa later recounted the \"myth\" that Pujols only made the Opening Day roster in 2001 because Bobby Bonilla was injured. According to La Russa, he and the rest of Cardinals management were impressed enough by Pujols that they decided to promote him to the big league club even before Bonilla\\'s injury. Although the team did not require Pujols to fill any particular position, the Cardinals activated him to the Opening Day roster, and he started all season at either third base, right field, left field, or first base.\\n\\nOn Opening Day against the Colorado Rockies on April 2, he recorded his first career hit, a single against pitcher Mike Hampton in an 8â0 loss. Four days later, he had three hits and three RBI â including his first home run â against the Arizona Diamondbacks\\' Armando Reynoso in a 12â9 win. Through 2015, he was one of three players to hit 20 or more home runs in their rookie year before July, along with Wally Berger (1930) and Joc Pederson (2015).\\n\\nAt midseason, Pujols became the first Cardinals\\' rookie since Luis Arroyo in 1955 to make the All-Star Game. He finished the season batting .329 (sixth in the league) with 194 hits (fifth in the league), 47 doubles (fifth in the league), 37 home runs and 112 runs. His 37 home runs led the Cardinals, topping Jim Edmonds\\'s 30 and McGwire\\'s 29. He was named the National League (NL) Silver Slugger Award winner for the third base position, and he finished fourth in NL Most Valuable Player (MVP) voting, behind Barry Bonds, Sammy Sosa and Luis Gonzalez. He was unanimously named the NL Rookie of the Year after setting an NL rookie record with 130 RBI (fifth in the league) and becoming the fourth MLB rookie to hit .300 with 30 home runs, 100 runs and 100 RBI.\\n\\nThe Cardinals finished the 2001 season with a 93â69 record and advanced to the playoffs as the National League wild card team. The team advanced to the NL Division Series (NLDS). In Game 2 on October 10, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run home run against Diamondbacks pitcher Randy Johnson in a 4â1 victory. The Cardinals, however, were eliminated in five games, and Pujols had just two hits in 18 at-bats.\\n\\nAfter playing several positions in 2001, Pujols spent most of 2002 in left field. He began the season batting cleanup but was moved in May to the third spot in the lineup, where he remained for the rest of his Cardinals career. Pujols hit his 30th home run and 100th RBI of the season in a 5â4 loss to the Cincinnati Reds in August, making him the sixth Cardinal to have back-to-back 30-home-run seasons and the second Cardinal (the other was Ray Jablonski) to start his career with back-to-back 100-RBI seasons. The following month, Pujols hit a game-winning two-run single against Pete Munro in a 9â3 victory over the Houston Astros that gave the Cardinals the NL Central title. Pujols finished the year batting .314 (seventh in the NL) with 185 hits (tied for fourth in the NL), 40 doubles (eighth in the NL), 34 home runs (10th in the NL), 118 runs scored (second in the NL to Sosa\\'s 122) and 127 RBI (second in the NL). He became the first player in major league history to hit over .300 with at least 30 home runs, 100 runs scored and 100 RBI in his first two seasons. Pujols finished second in MVP voting to Bonds, becoming the first Cardinal since Stan Musial to finish in the top four in MVP voting for consecutive seasons. At the end of the 2002 season, Chris Haft of \"MLB.com\" called him \"an outstanding hitter.\"\\n\\nPujols\\'s contributions helped the Cardinals finish third in home runs and second in batting average and RBI; the Cardinals\\' pitching staff also finished fourth in ERA. The Cardinals again reached the playoffs, and Pujols had three hits and three RBI in a three-game sweep of the Diamondbacks in the 2002 NLDS. The team advanced to the 2002 NL Championship Series (NLCS), but lost in five games to the San Francisco Giants. Pujols had five hits, one home run and two RBI in the series.\\n\\nFive Cardinals were named to the All-Star Game in 2003 while Pujols led the NL in votes. It was the first of eight straight seasons that Pujols would reach the All-Star Game. From July 12 to August 16, Pujols had a 30-game hitting streak, tied for the second-longest in Cardinals\\' history with Musial and behind only Rogers Hornsby\\'s 33-game streak. On July 20, Pujols hit his 100th career home run, a game-winner in a 10â7 victory over the Dodgers. He became the fourth major leaguer to hit his 100th home run in his third season, along with Ralph Kiner, Eddie Mathews and Joe DiMaggio. Pujols hit his 114th home run on September 20 in a game against the Astros, which tied him with Kiner for most home runs by a player in his first three seasons.\\n\\nIn 157 games, Pujols hit 43 home runs (fourth in the league, behind Jim Thome, Richie Sexson and Bonds) and had 124 RBI (tied with Sexson for fourth and behind Preston Wilson, Gary Sheffield and Thome). He became the youngest player since Tommy Davis in 1962 to win the NL batting title after batting .359, and he led the league in runs (137), hits (212) and doubles (51). Pujols joined Rogers Hornsby as the only players in Cardinals\\' history to record more than 40 homers and 200 hits in the same season. Though his stellar play had Cardinals\\' fans chanting \"M-V-P!\" during home games as early as June, Pujols again finished second to Bonds in MVP voting. He won his second Silver Slugger Award and first \"Sporting News\" Player of the Year Award. Pujols\\' contributions helped the Cardinals rank second in batting average and third in home runs in the NL; however, the pitching staff posted a 4.60 ERA, which was below the league average, and the Cardinals missed the playoffs.\\n\\nSection::::New contract (2004â2005).\\nAfter receiving many awards in his first three seasons, Pujols was rewarded monetarily for his accomplishments on February 20, 2004, when he signed a seven-year, $100\\xa0million contract extension with a $16\\xa0million club option for 2011 with no-trade provisions. He was moved to first base in 2004 after the Cardinals traded Tino Martinez in the offseason. On June 16, he hit a walk-off home run against Reds pitcher Mike Matthews in the 10th inning of a 4â3 victory.\\n\\nPujols\\'s highlights later in the season included a July game in which he hit five RBI and three home runs, and another in which he broke up a no-hitter by Giants pitcher Dustin Hermanson. During a September game against the Rockies, he earned his 500th RBI, joining DiMaggio and Ted Williams as the only players to have 500 RBI in their first four seasons. He said he was confident there was going to be \"a lot more.\" Although Pujols was diagnosed with plantar fasciitis during the second half of the season, he finished the season with a .331 average (fifth in the league), 196 hits (fifth), 51 doubles (second to Lyle Overbay\\'s 53), 46 home runs (tied with Adam Dunn for second behind AdriÃ¡n BeltrÃ©\\'s 48) and 123 RBI (third, behind Vinny Castilla\\'s 131 and Scott Rolen\\'s 124) in 154 games. He also led the league in runs scored, with 133. He finished third in MVP voting (behind Bonds and BeltrÃ©), joining Musial as the only Cardinals to finish in the top five in voting for at least four years in a row. He won the Silver Slugger Award at first base, the third position he won the award at. Pujols, along with teammates Edmonds and Rolen, earned the nickname \"MV3\" for their phenomenal seasons; Pujols led the three in home runs and batting average.\\n\\nThe Cardinals won the NL Central, aided by the MVP and pitcher Chris Carpenter, who won 15 games and had a 3.46 ERA his first season with the team. In Game 4 of the NLDS against the Dodgers, Pujols hit a three-run home run against Wilson Ãlvarez and had four RBI as the Cardinals won, 6â2, and took the series three games to one. In Game 6 of the NLCS, Pujols had three hits, scored three runs (including the winning run), and hit a two-run home run off Munro in a 12-inning, 6â4 victory. The Cardinals won the series in seven games, advancing to the World Series for the first time since 1987. Pujols was named the NLCS MVP after batting .500 with four home runs and nine RBI. He was one of three Cardinals to bat over .250 in the series against the Boston Red Sox (after batting .333) as the Cardinals were swept by Boston in four games.\\n\\nBy 2005, many baseball fans thought that Pujols was the best Cardinal since Musial. Pujols picked up his 100th RBI of the season on August 31, joining Williams, DiMaggio and Al Simmons as the only players with 100 RBI in their first five seasons. Pujols hit his 200th career home run in a game against the Reds on September 30, making him the third-youngest major league player to reach that milestone (behind Mel Ott and Eddie Mathews) and the second-fastest to reach it (behind Kiner). In 161 games, Pujols batted .330 (second to Derrek Lee\\'s .335 average) with 195 hits (fourth behind Lee, Miguel Cabrera and Jimmy Rollins), 38 doubles, 41 home runs (third, behind Andruw Jones\\'s 51 and Lee\\'s 46), 117 RBI (tied with Burrell for second behind Jones\\'s 128) and 129 runs scored (first in the league). For the first time in his career, he won the NL MVP award as Bonds was limited to 14 games due to an injury.\\n\\nPujols returned to the playoffs as the Cardinals won the NL Central for the second year in a row. He had five hits in nine at-bats with four runs scored and two RBI in the NLDS as the Cardinals swept the Padres. In Game 5 of the NLCS against the Astros, with the Cardinals trailing by two runs and only one out from elimination in the ninth inning, Pujols hit a game-winning three-run home run against Brad Lidge that landed on the train tracks in the back of Minute Maid Park. The Cardinals won 5â4. \"MLB.com\" writer Matthew Leach later called it \"one of the most famous playoff home runs in recent years.\" Nevertheless, the Cardinals were eliminated in Game 6 by the Astros. Pujols batted .304 with two home runs and six RBI in the series.\\n\\nSection::::Continued success and first World Series (2006â2008).\\nOver two games in April 2006, Pujols hit home runs in four consecutive plate appearances, making him the 20th player to accomplish the feat. Pujols maintained after the game that he was more concerned with winning than the numbers: \"I don\\'t look at numbers,\" he said. \"I don\\'t know. I didn\\'t know anything about [the record] until you guys brought it up. Because that\\'s not me. I don\\'t get locked in on numbers. I don\\'t get locked in on anything like that. I get locked in on seeing the ball and helping my team out to win and hopefully doing some damage out there.\"\\n\\nPujols had three hits and four RBI, including his 1,000th career hit (a home run against Jerome Williams), as the Cardinals defeated the Cubs 9â3 on April 21, 2006. On June 4, he was placed on the disabled list (DL) for the first time in his career with a strained right oblique that kept him out for three weeks.\\nOn August 22, Pujols hit a three-run home run and a grand slam against John Maine in an 8â7 loss to the Mets. On September 28, with the Cardinals trailing 2â1 to the Padres in the eighth inning, he hit a game-winning three-run home run against Cla Meredith, helping the Cardinals win 4â2 and end a seven-game losing streak. The win preserved the Cardinals\\' 1.5 game division lead; La Russa said afterward that it was \"the most huge of the huge ones he\\'s hit.\"\\n\\nPujols finished the season with a .331 average (third to Freddy Sanchez\\'s .344 and Cabrera\\'s .339), 177 hits, 33 doubles, 49 home runs (second to Ryan Howard\\'s 58), 137 RBI (second to Howard, 149) and 119 runs scored (tied with Matt Holliday, Hanley RamÃ­rez, and Alfonso Soriano for fifth). Of his 49 home runs, 20 accounted for a game-winning RBI, breaking Willie Mays\\' single-season record set in 1962. He finished second to Howard in MVP voting and won the NL Gold Glove Award for first base. He won his first of four consecutive Fielding Bible Awards for the first base position.\\n\\nLed by Pujols and Carpenter, the Cardinals won the NL Central and reached the playoffs for the third year in a row. In Game 1 of the NLDS against the Padres, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Jake Peavy as the Cardinals won 5â1. He had a game-winning RBI against David Wells and had three hits in Game 2 as the Cardinals won 2â0. He batted .333 with a home run and an RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Padres in four games. In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Mets, Pujols scored three runs as the Cardinals won 9â6. He batted .318 with one home run and one RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Mets in seven games.\\n\\nIn Game 1 of the World Series against the Detroit Tigers, he hit a game-winning two-run home run against Justin Verlander as the Cardinals won 4â2. In Game 5, he made a sprawling, flip-from-his-back play to rob PlÃ¡cido Polanco of a hit as the Cardinals clinched the series giving Pujols his first career World Series ring.\\nNear the beginning of the 2007 season in an April 22 game against the Cubs, Pujols hit a game-winning three-run home run against Ryan Dempster in the 10th inning of a 12â9 victory, tying Ken Boyer for second all-time on the Cardinals\\' home run list with his 255th. Pujols finished the season with 185 hits, 38 doubles and 103 RBI (a career-low). He was among the league leaders in batting average (.327, sixth) and home runs (32, tied with Carlos Lee and Chris Young) for 10. He scored 99 runs, ending his streak of seasons with at least 30 home runs, a .300 average, 100 runs scored and 100 RBI, at six. He grounded into a major-league leading 27 double plays. He finished ninth in MVP voting, the first year he had finished outside the top five in his career.\\n\\nPujols began 2008 by reaching base in 42 straight games, the longest streak to open a season since Derek Jeter reached base in the first 53 games of 1999. On June 11, he was placed on the DL with a strained left calf muscle. Although he was expected to miss three weeks, he was activated from the DL on June 26. Pujols hit his 300th home run against Bob Howry on July 4 in a 2â1 loss to the Cubs. He said after the game that to him it was \"just another homer that goes out of the park. I\\'m happy to do it in front of our fansâthey were waiting for it.\"\\nOn September 11, in a 3â2 loss to the Cubs, Pujols hit his 100th RBI of the season against Rich Harden, making him the third player in major league history to start his career with eight seasons of at least 100 RBI (along with Simmons and Williams). He regretted that the milestone came in a loss, saying, \"I wish it would have come with a great win. It would have been more special.\" In 148 games in 2008, Pujols batted .357 (second to Chipper Jones\\'s .364 average) with 187 hits (third, behind Reyes\\'s 204 and David Wright\\'s 189), 44 doubles (tied with Stephen Drew and Aramis RamÃ­rez for fourth in the league behind Berkman and Nate McLouth\\'s 46 and Corey Hart\\'s 45), 37 home runs (tied with Ryan Braun and Ryan Ludwick for fourth in the league behind Howard\\'s 48, Dunn\\'s 40, and Delgado\\'s 38), 116 RBI (fourth, behind Howard\\'s 146, Wrights 124 and Adrian Gonzalez\\'s 119) and 100 runs scored. He grounded into a National League-leading 27 double plays. Pujols won his second NL MVP Award, and he won the Silver Slugger Award for the fourth time in his career. He was named \"The Sporting News\" Player of the Year for the second time in his career. For his work off the field, he was named the 2008 winner of the Roberto Clemente Award. He considered having Tommy John surgery after the season but underwent nerve transposition surgery on his right elbow instead to ease discomfort.\\n\\nSection::::Later career and second World Series (2009â2011).\\nOn April 25, 2009, Pujols picked up his 1,000th career RBI with a 441-foot grand slam against David Patton in an 8â2 victory over the Cubs. \"I hit that ball as good as I can hit a ball,\" he said after the game. On July 3, he hit his 10th career grand slam against Weathers in a 7â4 victory over the Reds, breaking Musial\\'s record for most grand slams by a Cardinal. The grand slam was also his 350th career home run, making him the third-fastest player to reach the milestone, behind Alex Rodriguez and Ken Griffey, Jr.. He received the highest number of votes in NL history for the All-Star Game that year.\\n\\nPujols had four hits, three runs scored and five RBI on August 4, including a grand slam against Sean Green which tied the NL record for most grand slams in a season (five), in a 10-inning, 12â7 victory over the Mets. In 160 games, Pujols batted .327 (third, behind RamÃ­rez\\'s .342 and Pablo Sandoval\\'s .330) with 186 hits (sixth), 45 doubles (second to Miguel Tejada\\'s 46), 47 home runs (first), 135 RBI (third behind Fielder and Howard\\'s 141) and 124 runs scored (first). He was unanimously named the NL MVP for the third time, tying Musial as the Cardinals\\' leader in that category. For the fifth time in his career, he won the Silver Slugger Award. He won the \"Sporting News\" MLB Player of the Year award for the second consecutive year, joining Williams and Joe Morgan as the only players to win it in back-to-back years. For the fourth year in a row, he won the Fielding Bible Award for first base.\\n\\nAided by the mid-season acquisition of Matt Holliday (who replaced Ryan Ludwick as the cleanup hitter) and the emergence of Adam Wainwright (who led the NL in wins), the Cardinals returned to the playoffs after a two-year hiatus. In the NLDS against the Dodgers, Pujols batted .300 with one RBI as the Cardinals were swept in three games. Following the postseason, Pujols had surgery to remove five bone spurs from his right elbow. The Cardinals called the surgery a \"success,\" and Dr. James Andrews decided that Pujols did not need Tommy John surgery at that time.\\n\\nFor April 2010, Pujols earned his first Pepsi Clutch Performer of the Month Award. He batted .348, 1.270 OPS, three home runs and 14 RBI with runners on base. Further, in situations with his team leading by one run, tied, or having the potential tying run on base, at bat, or on deck after the seventh inning (\"late-and-close\"), he batted .583 (7-for-12) with a home run, two doubles, three RBI and five runs scored.\\n\\nOn June 29, 2010, in an 8â0 victory over the Diamondbacks, Pujols hit five RBI and hit two home runs against Dontrelle Willis for his 37th career multihomer game, which tied Musial\\'s franchise record for multihomer games. \"It\\'s pretty special,\" he said of tying Musial. \"I\\'m blessed to have the opportunity to be compared sometimes with him.\"\\n\\nOn August 26, he hit his 400th career home run against Jordan Zimmermann in a 13-inning, 11â10 loss to the Nationals. He became the third-youngest player to reach the milestoneâbehind Griffey, Jr. and Rodriguezâand he became the fourth-quickest player by at bats to reach the milestone (behind McGwire, Babe Ruth, Harmon Killebrew, and Thome). On September 11, in a 12-inning 6â3 loss to Atlanta, Pujols had three RBI and reached 100 RBI for the 10th consecutive year with a two-run double against Tommy Hanson. Only Simmons has a longer streak of 100 RBI seasons at the beginning of a career, with 11. Pujols joined Jimmie Foxx, Lou Gehrig, and Rodriguez in having 10 consecutive seasons of 100 or more RBI at any time in their career. Foxx and Rodriguez are the only two players besides Pujols to have 10 consecutive years of 30 home runs and 100 RBI. The next day, in a 7â3 victory over the Braves, he passed Musial to be the all-time Cardinals\\' leader in multi-home run games when he hit two home runs against Tim Hudson for the 38th time in a game.\\n\\nIn 159 games, Pujols batted .312 (sixth) with 183 hits (fifth) and 39 doubles (tied for eighth with Marlon Byrd); he led the league in runs scored (115), home runs (42) and RBI (118). He won his second Gold Glove Award for first base, and he won the NL First Base Silver Slugger Award for the sixth time. He finished second in the NL MVP voting to Joey Votto, who said he was \"shocked\" that Pujols only got one first-place vote.\\n\\nPujols and the Cardinals set a deadline for the start of 2011 spring training for contract extension negotiations but failed to reach an agreement. After Pujols struggled in his first 30 games of the season in batting .231, he batted .316 with 30 home runs in his final 117 games. Against the Cubs, he hit consecutive extra-inning walk-off home runs on June 4 and 5 for the first time since Albert Belle in 1995. Carpenter noted after the game that Pujols\\' slump earlier in the year was over: \"He continues to do great things, there\\'s no doubt about it,\" he said. \"The things that he\\'s done the last few days have been just like the old Albert.\"\\n\\nOn June 19 against the Royals, Wilson Betemit collided with Pujols, inducing a small fracture his left wrist and keeping him inactive until July 5. On July 30, in a 9â2 victory over the Cubs, he got his 2,000th career hit against Carlos MÃ¡rmol, becoming the fifth Cardinal to reach 2,000 hits and 12th-fastest major leaguer by games to reach the milestone. In the Cardinals\\' final game of the season, against the Astros on September 28, he had the game-winning RBI against Brett Myers in the 8â0 victory, helping the Cardinals overcome a 10.5-game deficit to Atlanta to win the Wild Card. Pujols finished the season with 173 hits (tied for ninth with Aramis RamÃ­rez), 29 doubles (a career-low), and 105 runs scored (tied for third with Justin Upton behind Ryan Braun\\'s 109 and Matt Kemp\\'s 115). He saw his streak of seasons batting at least .300 with 30 home runs and 100 RBI snapped when he hit 37 home runs (third, behind Fielder\\'s 38 and Kemp\\'s 39), but batted .299 with 99 RBI (seventh); however, only three other players in the major leagues matched him in those categories (JosÃ© Bautista, Fielder, and Kemp), causing Tyler Kepner of \"The New York Times\" to write, \"Even when Pujols struggles, he excels.\" He grounded into a major-league leading 29 double plays. He was fifth in MVP voting.\\n\\nIn Game 2 of the NLDS against the Phillies on October 2, Pujols had a game-winning RBI single against Cliff Lee in the 5â4 victory. He batted .350 with one RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Phillies in five games. In Game 2 of the NLCS against the Brewers, he had four hits, three runs scored, one home run and five RBI, in a 12â3 victory. He batted .478 with two home runs and nine RBI in the series as the Cardinals defeated the Brewers in six games.\\n\\nOn October 22, in Game 3 of the World Series, Pujols became the first player to get at least four hits, two home runs and five RBI in a World Series game in a 16â7 victory over the Rangers. Pujols had five hits, three home runs, four runs scored and six RBI in the game. He joined Babe Ruth and Reggie Jackson as the only players in baseball history to hit three home runs in a World Series game (Pablo Sandoval would also accomplish the feat the following year), became the first player in series history to have hits in four consecutive innings, and tied records for most hits and most RBI in a World Series game. He had one hit and no RBI the other six games of the series but became a World Series champion for the second time as the Cardinals defeated the Rangers in seven games. After the season, he became a free agent for the first time in his career.\\n\\nSection::::Los Angeles Angels of Anaheim / Los Angeles Angels (2012âpresent).\\nThree teams were reported to be interested in Pujols during the offseason: the Cardinals, the Miami Marlins, and the Los Angeles Angels. The Cardinals offered Pujols a 10-year, $210\\xa0million deal (with $30\\xa0million deferred), but Pujols rejected it. His wife explained on a radio talk show that they were \"insulted\" and \"confused\" that the Cardinals had initially offered Pujols a five-year deal. The Marlins reportedly offered Pujols a 10-year contract too, but on December 8, he signed a 10-year deal with the Angels worth around $254\\xa0million. The contract offered by the Marlins was reportedly around the value as that offered by the Angels. However, the Marlins refused to include a no trade clause in the contract.\\n\\nSection::::2012.\\nPujols did not perform very well to begin the 2012 season, batting .217 with no home runs and four RBI in the month of April. Soon after the Angels called up top prospect Mike Trout and fired hitting coach Mickey Hatcher, Pujols\\'s numbers began to rise, as he batted .323 with 13 home runs from May 15 through the All-Star Break. On July 31, he hit two home runs against Derek Holland in a 6â2 victory over the Rangers. After the game, Holland observed that Pujols had \"definitely turned it around, no doubt about it... He had a slow start, but he\\'s picked it up. He\\'s a great hitter...\" On August 14, Pujols had four RBIs, including a game-winning three-run home run against Ubaldo JimÃ©nez in a 9â6 victory over the Cleveland Indians. \\n\\nIn 153 games, Pujols batted .285 (at the time, a career low) with 173 hits, 50 doubles (second to Alex Gordon\\'s 51), 30 home runs, 105 RBIs (7th in AL), and 85 runs scored.\\n\\nSection::::2013.\\nOn August 19, 2013, Pujols was ruled out for the remainder of the 2013 season after suffering a foot injury. Pujols had by far the worst season of his career in 2013, failing to play at least 100 games for the first time in his career. Pujols also posted career worsts in hits, runs scored, doubles, home runs, RBI, walks, batting average, on base percentage, slugging percentage, and OPS. Overall in 99 games, Pujols batted .258 with 101 hits, 19 doubles, 17 home runs, 64 RBI, and 49 runs scored.\\n\\nIn August 2013, former Cardinals player Jack Clark accused Pujols of using performance-enhancing drugs on his radio show on WGNU in St. Louis. Clark served as the Cardinals\\' hitting coach during the early part of Pujols\\'s tenure in St. Louis. On the morning of August 9, Pujols issued a statement adamantly denying that he had ever taken PEDs. He denounced Clark\\'s allegations as \"irresponsible and reckless,\" and threatened to sue Clark and WGNU over the allegations. Partly due to legal threats from Pujols, InsideSTL Enterprises, which owns WGNU\\'s weekday airtime under a time brokerage agreement, cut ties with Clark. On October 4, 2013, Pujols filed a defamation lawsuit against Clark. In response, Clark challenged Pujols to both take polygraph tests to resolve who is telling the truth. However, on February 10, 2014, Clark apologized and retracted his accusations against Pujols, saying he had \"no knowledge whatsoever\" that Pujols ever used PEDs. \"During a heated discussion on air, I misspoke,\" Clark said. In return, Pujols dropped the suit.\\n\\nSection::::2014.\\nOn April 22, 2014, Pujols hit his 499th and 500th home runs of his career off of Taylor Jordan in a game versus the Washington Nationals at Nationals Park. Pujols became the 26th player ever to reach the 500 home run mark, as well as the third youngest to reach it. He also became the first player to hit career home runs 499 and 500 in the same game. Nationals Park is the same ballpark where he hit his 400th career home run in the 2010 season. Participating in the longest game of the year in MLB, and the longest in the history of Angel Stadium, Pujols ended a 19-inning, 6:31 contest against the Red Sox with a solo home run for a 5â4 final score. It was also his first walk-off home run as an Angel and first since June 2011. On September 6, against the Minnesota Twins, Pujols collected his 2,500th career hit, a two-run go-ahead double off of Jared Burton in the 9th inning. He also passed the 1,500 run mark in the same game. In the process, he became the fifth player in major league history with 2,500 hits and 500 home runs while maintaining a .310 lifetime batting average (the others were Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Ted Williams, and Manny Ramirez). For the season, he batted .272 and grounded into an American League-leading 28 double plays. After the 2014 season, Pujols led all active players in doubles, with 561.\\n\\nAfter the season, Pujols traveled to Japan to join a team of MLB All-Stars playing against All-Stars of Nippon Professional Baseball in the 2014 Major League Baseball Japan All-Star Series.\\n\\nSection::::2015.\\nBefore the 2015 season, Pujols enjoyed his first offseason in his time with the Angels in which he was both free of injury or recuperation from injury. However, his offensive production lagged behind his career levels the first month of the season. By the end of April, Pujols was batting .208 with three home runs and nine RBI in 86 plate appearances. While it was suggested that this was because of older age, or his recent poor health, it seemed to be simply due to bad luck. The next month, Pujols\\' offensive production had started to come around. Between May 28 and June 22 he batted .356 with 15 homers, 30 RBI and a 1.326 OPS. At this time, he was leading the American League in home runs with 23, and was on pace to hit more than 50.\\n\\nAfter batting .303/.395/.737 with 13 home runs in June 2015, Pujols was named AL Player of the Month for the first time and seventh overall monthly award. His home run total led the major leagues and 73 total bases tied Manny Machado for first in the AL. Remarkably, his batting average on balls in play was .218, significantly lower than the league average of about .300.\\n\\nSelected to the 2015 All Star Game, Pujols was announced as a reserve for the American League. Due to an injury just days earlier with Tigers slugger Miguel Cabrera, Pujols instead started at first base. It was his 10th overall selection to the midsummer classic, and first as a member of the Angels.\\n\\nOn September 22, Pujols hit his 556th career home run to pass RamÃ­rez for sole possession of 14th place on the all-time career home run leaderboard. In the last game of the season, on October 4, Pujols hit his 40th home run, the seventh time he had done so in a season. Among active MLB players, he trailed only Alex Rodriguez, with eight. With Trout also hitting 40 home runs, the 2015 Angels became just the 31st team in MLB history with multiple players to hit 40+ home runs in a season. For the season, he batted .244/.307/.480, and he had the lowest batting average on balls in play (.217) of all major league players.\\n\\nSection::::2016.\\nOn April 30, 2016, Pujols became the 85th player to make 10,000 career plate appearances. On May 2, Pujols became the 20th player all-time to amass 5,000 career total bases. On August 17, Pujols joined Barry Bonds as the only other player to be intentionally walked over 300 times. Playing the Toronto Blue Jays on August 25, he reached 100 RBI for the 13th time in his career, the fifth player to do so.\\n\\nWhile playing Cincinnati on August 29, Pujols hit his 26th home run and 103rd RBI of the season. The home run tied him with Frank Robinson for ninth place on the all-time home run list at 586, and allowed him to become the seventh player all-time with 1,200 career extra base hits, and the 21st to reach 1,800 RBI. On September 16, Pujols became the 16th player all-time to reach 600 career doubles. \\n\\nHe batted .268 for the season. He tied for 2nd in the AL in double plays grounded into, with 24. For the season, he had the second-slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 22.6 feet/second.\\n\\nSection::::2017.\\nOn June 3, 2017, Pujols became the ninth player in Major League history to hit at least 600 home runs, when he hit a grand slam against the Minnesota Twins. He was the fourth-youngest player to achieve the feat (behind Alex Rodriguez, Babe Ruth and Hank Aaron), and the first to hit a grand slam for his 600th home run. On August 10, Pujols became the 37th player all-time to amass 11,000 career plate appearances. \\n\\nFor the season, Pujols played in 149 games and had 593 at bats but set career-lows in batting average (.241), on base percentage (.286), slugging percentage (.386), doubles (17), and walks (37), while leading the majors by grounding into 26 double plays. He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players, at 21.8 feet/second.\\n\\nSection::::2018.\\nOn May 4, Albert Pujols recorded his 3,000th major league hit, against Mike Leake of the Seattle Mariners. On June 10, Pujols surpassed Stan Musial\\'s career RBI total of 1,951, moving into seventh place all-time for that category. On June 18, he became the 29th player all-time to amass 10,000 career at-bats.\\n\\nOn July 12, Pujols hit his 630th career home run, moving into a tie with Ken Griffey Jr. for sixth place all-time for that category. The next day, Pujols was placed on the 10-day disabled list due to left knee inflammation. He hit a single on August 10 for his 1,000th hit as an Angel, becoming the ninth player to record 1,000 hits in both the American League and National League. He had surgery on his left knee in August, ending his season, and on his right elbow to remove a bone spur in September.\\n\\nIn 2018 he batted .245/.289/.411 with 19 home runs, and 64 RBIs (matching the lowest season total of his career). He had the slowest baserunning sprint speed of all major league players for the second consecutive year, at 22.2 feet/second. He was the sixth-oldest player in the American League.\\n\\nSection::::Playing style.\\nPujols\\'s swing has been praised for its consistency. \"It\\'s the same swing every time,\" former teammate Lance Berkman once said. \"He has the ability to repeat his swing over and over and over, which leads to him being very consistent,\" Cardinals\\' video coordinator Chad Blair said. \"Sports Illustrated\" writer Daniel G. Habib described the swing as \"quick\" and \"quiet.\" Pujols uses a 32.5-ounce bat against right-handed pitchers, but he uses a 33-ounce bat against left-handers to avoid trying to pull the ball when he swings. He has credited his hitting ability partly to guessing what pitchers will do: \\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nPujols married his wife, Deidre, on January 1, 2000. They have five children: Isabella (Deidre\\'s daughter from a previous relationship), Albert, Jr., Sophia, Ezra and Esther Grace. During the offseason, they live in St. Louis. Albert and his wife are supporters of people with Down syndrome, a condition Isabella was born with. In 2007, Pujols became a U.S. citizen, scoring a perfect 100 on his citizenship test.\\n\\nPujols is close friends with third baseman PlÃ¡cido Polanco, a former teammate with the Cardinals. Polanco has called Pujols his \"closest friend in baseball,\" and Pujols is the godfather to Polanco\\'s son, Ishmael. Pujols is also friends with Robinson CanÃ³, who selected Mark Trumbo for the 2012 Home Run Derby after Pujols asked him to.\\n\\nIn 2009, Pujols donated money to the Mike Coolbaugh Memorial Tournament, allowing the event to occur after a sponsor backed out. On August 28, 2010, Pujols and La Russa attended Glenn Beck\\'s Restoring Honor rally in Washington, D.C., after being assured by Beck that the rally was not political. During the rally, Pujols was presented with a medal for his off-the-field efforts.\\n\\nSection::::Business ventures.\\nIn 2006, Pujols and the Hanon family opened Pujols 5 Westport Grill, a restaurant located in Westport Plaza of Maryland Heights, Missouri. A 10-foot, 1,100-lb. statue of Pujols was dedicated on November 2, 2011, outside the restaurant. An anonymous donor commissioned sculptor Harry Weber to create the statue, which belongs to the Pujols Family Foundation. After Pujols signed with the Angels, the restaurant was renamed the St. Louis Sports Hall of Fame Grill.\\n\\nIn 2008, Pujols teamed up with St. Louis Soccer United, a group looking to bring a Major League Soccer (MLS) franchise to the St. Louis area. However, the group\\'s bid for a franchise was unsuccessful, and a USL team (Saint Louis FC) was formed .\\n\\nSection::::Christianity.\\nPujols and his wife are Christians. He became a Christian on November 13, 1998, influenced in part by Deidre and his grandmother. \\n\\nDuring his tenure with the Cardinals, Pujols and his family attended West County Community Church, a Southern Baptist church in Wildwood, Missouri.\\n\\nSection::::Pujols Family Foundation.\\nIn 2005, Albert and Deidre Pujols launched the Pujols Family Foundation, a 501(c)(3) non-profit dedicated to their \"commitment to faith, family and others.\" The organization promotes awareness of Down syndrome and works to support those who have it and their families, aids the poor in the Dominican Republic, and supports people with disabilities and/or life-threatening illnesses. Among other activities, the foundation hosts events for people with Down syndrome. The foundation gave the Down Syndrome Association of Greater St. Louis the resources to open an office and hire staff. In 2009, the Albert Pujols Wellness Center for Adults with Down Syndrome opened in Chesterfield, Missouri; Pujols was present at the opening on November 18. The foundation hosts an annual \"All Stars Basketball Game\" with down syndrome players at Missouri Baptist University.\\n\\nPujols has taken several trips to the Dominican Republic, by taking supplies as well as a team of doctors and dentists to the poor who need medical care. The Pujols Family Foundation also holds an annual golf tournament to raise money to send dentists to the Dominican Republic.\\n\\nSection::::Accomplishments.\\nThrough 2018, Pujols ranked in the top 10 players in major league history in four career statistical categories: home runs (sixth), runs batted in (seventh), total bases (ninth), and doubles (10th). He also holds the all-time career record for Grounding Into a Double Play with 374. At the end of the 2018 season, he ranked among active players ninth in batting average (.302), second in slugging percentage (.554), and fourth in on-base plus slugging (.936). Through 2018, he ranked first among active players in doubles, home runs, RBI and runs scored. Pujols has a .994 fielding percentage at first base through 2018 (13th among active first basemen), led active first basemen in career errors with 106, and set the major league single-season record for assists with 185 in 2009.\\n\\nPujols is in the top 10 in several Cardinals\\' statistics. He is second to Musial in doubles (455), home runs (445) and RBI (1,329). He is seventh in games (1,705), seventh in batting average (.328), third in runs scored (1,291, behind Musial and Lou Brock), and fourth in hits (2,073, behind Musial, Brock and Hornsby). He also is in the top 10 in several single-season Cardinals\\' records. His 137 runs scored in 2003 are tied for seventh with Tommy McCarthy, his 51 doubles in 2003 and 2004 are tied with Musial for sixth, he holds five of the top 10 Cardinals\\' home run totals, and his 137 RBI in 2006 are tied for seventh with Jim Bottomley, Johnny Mize and Joe Torre.\\n\\nPujols has earned praise from many of his fellow players and coaches. In 2008, he was named the most feared hitter in baseball in a poll of all 30 MLB managers. La Russa has called him \"the best player I\\'ve ever managed.\" Votto referred to him as \"one of the greatest hitters of all time.\" Larry Walker called him \"a great hitter,\" and Brendan Ryan said, \"He\\'s the best there is.\" Fernando ViÃ±a said, while Pujols was with the Cardinals, \"He\\'s the face of the Cardinals.\"\\n\\n', 'title': 'Albert Pujols', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718196'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718354', 'text': 'Yibin\\n\\nYibin (; Sichuanese Pinyin: nyibin; Sichuanese pronunciation: ) is a prefecture-level city in the southeastern part of Sichuan province, China, located at the junction of the Min and Yangtze Rivers. Its population was 4,471,840 inhabitants according to the 2010 census of whom 836,340 lived in the built-up area made of Cuiping District.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nHuman habitation of Yibin dates back at least 4,000 years. Yibin was established as a county in the Han dynasty (206 BC â AD 220). Under the Ming and Qing, the town and its hinterland was known as Xuzhou Commandery \"XÃ¹zhÅufÇ\"), which was variously romanized as Suifu, Suifoo, and Suchow. Its population around 1907 was estimated at 50,000.\\n\\nSection::::Geography and climate.\\nYibin is located in the southeast portion of Sichuan at the southern end of the Sichuan Basin, bordering Zhaotong (Yunnan) to the south, Luzhou to the east, Liangshan Yi Autonomous Prefecture and Leshan to the west, and Zigong to the north, and has a total area is . The city ranges in latitude from 27Â° 50\\'â29Â° 16\\' N, and in longitude from 103Â° 36\\'â105Â° 20\\' E, stretching east-west and north-south.\\n\\nThe city is located at the confluence of the Min and Yangtze Rivers. Above Yibin, the Yangtze is also known as the Jinsha River. Below Yibin, the Yangtze is known in Chinese as the \"Chang Jiang\" or \"Long River.\"\\n\\nAs with the rest of the Sichuan Basin, Yibin has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (KÃ¶ppen \"Cwa\") with high humidity year-round; winters are short and mild while summers long, hot, and humid. The monthly 24-hour average temperature ranges from in January to in July and August; the annual mean is . Despite its location in the Yangtze River valley, it is still cooler than Chongqing, located further downstream, in its warmest months. Frost is uncommon and the frost-free period lasts 347 days. Rainfall is common year-round but is the greatest in July and August, with very little of it in the cooler months. With monthly percent possible sunshine ranging from 10% in December and January to 42% in August, the city receives only 1,018 hours of bright sunshine annually; Yibin has one of the lowest annual sunshine totals nationally, lower than even nearby Chengdu and Chongqing. Spring (MarchâApril) tends to be sunnier and warmer in the day than autumn (OctoberâNovember).\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nThe city\\'s industry focuses on electronics, food products, and power generation. It also produces paper, silk, and leather products. The surrounding region is rich in agricultural resources, growing rice, barley, oil seeds, sesame, and tea.\\n\\nThe largest employer in Yibin is Wuliangye, a company best known for Wuliangye, a brand of sorghum-based distilled spirits known as baijiu. The Wuliangye Group grew from a small company employing just 300 people in 1977 into a large company employing over 20,000 on a seven square kilometer plant. According to an August 2005 article in a securities weekly, the Wuliangye Group is 72% state owned and provides 70% of the revenues of Yibin City, a major regional center at the head of the Yangtze in southeastern Sichuan. In 2004 6,225 retired military worked for the company, out of a total work force of over 20,000. One third of top management positions are held by retired members of the military. Unsuccessful efforts to diversify its business, poor transparency and a murky ownership pictures are among the company\\'s problems today. However, liquor is not the sole product of the WuLiangye Group. It also provides the specialized high-tech anti-counterfeit packaging and printing business and engineering services. Wuliangye now contributes about 60% of Yibin\\'s GDP.\\n\\nSection::::Transportation.\\nThe region\\'s natural waterways provide transportation links with the surrounding area, and Yibin is also connected to Chongqing and Chengdu by rail and express highway. Yibin\\'s proximity to the Yunnan and Guizhou borders also means that transportation to the provinces is available by rail and by bus.\\n\\nYibin has three and ten .\\n\\nYibin Airport offers flights to Beijing, Guangzhou, Guiyang, Hangzhou, Kunming, Lhasa, Sanya, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Xi\\'an, and Yichang.\\n\\nSection::::Tourism.\\nThere are several hot springs near Yibin, plus many other tourist attractions. Such attractions include the Bamboo Sea in Changning County and the Xingwen Stone Forest. Cuiping mountain in the centre of the city provides wonderful views of Yibin.

The language of Uzbeks, it is spoken by some 33 million native speakers in Uzbekistan and elsewhere in Central Asia.\\n\\nUzbek belongs to the Eastern Turkic, or Karluk, branch of the Turkic language family. External influences include Persian, Arabic and Russian. One of the most noticeable distinctions of Uzbek from other Turkic languages is the rounding of the vowel to , a feature that was influenced by Persian.\\n\\nSection::::Name.\\nIn the language itself, Uzbek is \\' or \\'. In Arabic script, and .\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nTurkic speakers probably settled the Amu Darya, Syr Darya and Zarafshan river basins since at least 600â700 CE, gradually ousting or assimilating the speakers of Eastern Iranian languages who previously inhabited Sogdia, Bactria and Khwarezm. The first Turkic dynasty in the region was that of the Kara-Khanid Khanate in the 9thâ12th centuries, who were a confederation of Karluks, Chigils, Yaghma and other tribes.\\n\\nUzbek can be considered the direct descendant or a later form of Chagatai, the language of great Turkic Central Asian literary development in the realm of Chagatai Khan, Timur (Tamerlane), and the Timurid dynasty (including the early Mughal rulers of India). The language was championed by Ali-Shir Nava\\'i in the 15th and 16th centuries. Nava\\'i was the greatest representative of Chagatai language literature. He significantly contributed to the development of the Chagatai language and its direct descendant Uzbek and is widely considered to be the founder of Uzbek literature. Ultimately based on the Karluk variant of the Turkic languages, Chagatai contained large numbers of Persian and Arabic loanwords. By the 19th century it was rarely used for literary composition, but disappeared only in the early 20th century.\\n\\nThe term \"Uzbek\" as applied to language has meant different things at different times. Prior to 1921 \"Uzbek\" and \"Sart\" were considered to be different dialects:\\n\\nIn Khanate of Khiva, Sarts spoke a highly Oghuz Turkified form of Karluk Turkic. After 1921 the Soviet regime abolished the term \"Sart\" as derogatory, and decreed that henceforth the entire settled Turkic population of Turkestan would be known as \"Uzbeks\", even though many had no Uzbek tribal heritage.\\n\\nHowever, the standard written language that was chosen for the new republic in 1924, despite the protests of Uzbek Bolsheviks such as Fayzulla Khodzhayev, was not pre-revolutionary \"Uzbek\" but the \"Sart\" language of the Samarkand region. Edward A. Allworth argued that this \"badly distorted the literary history of the region\" and was used to give authors such as the 15th century author Ali-Shir Nava\\'i an Uzbek identity. All three dialects continue to exist within modern spoken Uzbek.\\n\\nSection::::Writing systems.\\nUzbek has been written in a variety of scripts throughout history:\\n\\nDespite the official status of the Latin script in Uzbekistan, the use of Cyrillic is still widespread, especially in advertisements and signs. In newspapers, scripts may be mixed, with headlines in Latin and articles in Cyrillic. The Arabic script is no longer used in Uzbekistan except symbolically in limited texts or for the academic studies of Chagatai (Old Uzbek).\\n\\nIn the western Chinese region of Xinjiang, where there is an Uzbek minority, the Arabic is still used.\\n\\nIn Afghanistan, the traditional Arabic orthography is still used.\\n\\nSection::::Grammar.\\nSection::::Phonology.\\nSection::::Vowels.\\nStandard Uzbek has six vowel phonemes:\\n\\nSection::::Morphology and syntax.\\nAs a Turkic language, Uzbek is null subject, agglutinative and has no articles and no noun classes (gender or otherwise). The word order is subjectâobjectâverb (SOV). Words are usually oxytones (i.e. the last syllable is stressed), but certain endings and suffixal particles are not stressed.\\n\\nIn Uzbek, there are two main categories of words:\\n\\nUzbek uses the following verbal suffixes:\\n\\nThe present and future tenses are both expressed with the \"-a\" and \"-y\" suffixes.\\n\\nNouns take the \"-ni\" suffix as an indefinite article. Unsuffixed nouns are understood as definite.\\n\\nSection::::Word order.\\nThe word order in the Uzbek language is subjectâobjectâverb (SOV), which means that, unlike in English, the object comes before the verb and the verb is the last element of the sentence. \\nSection::::Number of speakers.\\nEstimates of the number of speakers of Uzbek vary widely. The Swedish encyclopedia \"Nationalencyklopedin\" estimates the number of native speakers to be 30 million,\\nand the \"CIA World Factbook\" estimates 25 million. Other sources estimate the number of speakers of Uzbek to be 21 million in Uzbekistan, 3.4 million in Afghanistan, 900,000 in Tajikistan, 800,000 in Kyrgyzstan, 500,000 in Kazakhstan, 300,000 in Turkmenistan, and 300,000 in Russia.\\n\\nSection::::Loan words.\\nThe influence of Islam, and by extension, Arabic, is evident in Uzbek loanwords. There is also a residual influence of Russian, from the time when Uzbeks were under the rule of the Russian Empire and the Soviet Union. Most importantly, Uzbek vocabulary, phraseology and pronunciation has been heavily influenced by Persian through its historic roots. Uzbek has been significantly influenced by Persian and it also influenced Tajik (a variety of Persian). Among Turkic languages, perhaps Uzbek is the most influenced language by Persian.\\n\\nSection::::Dialects.\\nThe Uzbek language has many dialects, varying widely from region to region. However, there is a commonly understood dialect which is used in mass media and in most printed materials. Among the most-widespread dialects are the Tashkent dialect, Uzbek dialect, the Ferghana dialect, the Khorezm dialect, the Chimkent-Turkestan dialect, and the Surkhandarya dialect.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Uzbek language', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=71836', 'cat_id': '71836', 'cat_title': 'Brazilian_adult_models', 'cat_pages': '2', 'cat_subcats': '2', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718434', 'text': 'Hamilton Island\\n\\nHamilton Island may refer to:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hamilton Island', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=718434'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '718685', 'text': \"Henry Garrioch\\n\\nSir William Henry Garrioch (4 May 1916 â 18 February 2008) was the Acting Governor-General of Mauritius from 31 October 1977 until 23 March 1978.\\n\\nSection::::Legal career.\\nGarrioch joined the Colonial Service in 1936 and was subsequently appointed a First Grade Clerk in 1946, when he was picked to be a judge's secretary.

This hypothesis proposes that instead of segregating their DNA during mitosis in a random manner, adult stem cells divide their DNA asymmetrically, and retain a distinct template set of DNA strands (parental strands) in each division. By retaining the same set of template DNA strands, adult stem cells would pass mutations arising from errors in DNA replication on to non-stem cell daughters that soon terminally differentiate (end mitotic divisions and become a functional cell). Passing on these replication errors would allow adult stem cells to reduce their rate of accumulation of mutations that could lead to serious genetic disorders such as cancer.\\n\\nAlthough evidence for this mechanism exists, whether it is a mechanism acting in adult stem cells in vivo is still controversial.\\n\\nSection::::Methods.\\nTwo main assays are used to detect immortal DNA strand segregation: label-retention and label-release pulse/chase assays.\\n\\nIn the label-retention assay, the goal is to mark \\'immortal\\' or parental DNA strands with a DNA label such as tritiated thymidine or bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU). These types of DNA labels will incorporate into the newly synthesized DNA of dividing cells during S phase. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they have not yet delineated an immortal DNA strand. During these conditions, the adult stem cells are either dividing \"symmetrically\" (thus with each division a new \\'immortal\\' strand is determined and in at least one of the stem cells the immortal DNA strand will be marked with DNA label), or the adult stem cells have \"not yet been determined\" (thus their precursors are dividing symmetrically, and once they differentiate into adult stem cells and choose an \\'immortal\\' strand, the \\'immortal strand\\' will already have been marked). Experimentally, adult stem cells are undergoing symmetric divisions during growth and after wound healing, and are not yet determined at neonatal stages. Once the immortal DNA strand is labelled and the adult stem cell has begun or resumed asymmetric divisions, the DNA label is chased out. In symmetric divisions (most mitotic cells), DNA is segregating randomly and the DNA label will be diluted out to levels below detection after five divisions. If, however, cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, then all the labeled DNA will continue to co-segregate with the adult stem cell, and after five (or more) divisions will still be detected within the adult stem cell. These cells are sometimes called label-retaining cells (LRCs).\\n\\nIn the label-release assay, the goal is to mark the newly synthesized DNA that is normally passed on to the daughter (non-stem) cell. A pulse of DNA label is given to adult stem cells under conditions where they are dividing \"asymmetrically.\" Under conditions of homeostasis, adult stem cells should be dividing asymmetrically so that the same number of adult stem cells is maintained in the tissue compartment. After pulsing for long enough to label all the newly replicated DNA, the DNA label is chased out (each DNA replication now incorporates unlabeled nucleotides) and the adult stem cells are assayed for loss of the DNA label after two cell divisions. If cells are using a random segregation mechanism, then enough DNA label should remain in the cell to be detected. If, however, the adult stem cells are using an immortal DNA strand mechanism, they are obligated to retain the unlabeled \\'immortal\\' DNA, and will release all the newly synthesized labeled DNA to their differentiating daughter cells in two divisions.\\n\\nSome scientists have combined the two approaches, by first using one DNA label to label the immortal strands, allowing to adult stem cells to begin dividing asymmetrically, and then using a different DNA label to label the newly synthesized DNA. Thus, the adult stem cells will retain one DNA label and release the other within two divisions.\\n\\nSection::::Evidence.\\nEvidence for the immortal DNA strand hypothesis has been found in various systems. One of the earliest studies by Karl Lark \"et al.\" demonstrated co-segregation of DNA in the cells of plant root tips. Plant root tips labeled with tritiated thymidine tended to segregate their labeled DNA to the same daughter cell. Though not all the labeled DNA segregated to the same daughter, the amount of thymidine-labeled DNA seen in the daughter with less label corresponded to the amount that would have arisen from sister-chromatid exchange. Later studies by Christopher Potten \"et al.\" (2002), using pulse/chase experiments with tritiated thymidine, found long-term label-retaining cells in the small intestinal crypts of neonatal mice. These researchers hypothesized that long-term incorporation of tritiated thymidine occurred because neonatal mice have undeveloped small intestines, and that pulsing tritiated thymidine soon after the birth of the mice allowed the \\'immortal\\' DNA of adult stem cells to be labeled during their formation. These long-term cells were demonstrated to be actively cycling, as demonstrated by incorporation and release of BrdU.\\n\\nSince these cells were cycling but continued to contain the BrdU label in their DNA, the researchers reasoned that they must be segregating their DNA using an immortal DNA strand mechanism. Joshua Merok \"et al.\" from the lab of James Sherley engineered mammalian cells with an inducible p53 gene that controls asymmetric divisions. BrdU pulse/chase experiments with these cells demonstrated that chromosomes segregated non-randomly only when the cells were induced to divide asymmetrically like adult stem cells. These asymmetrically dividing cells provide an \"in vitro\" model for demonstration and investigation of immortal strand mechanisms. \\n\\nScientists have strived to demonstrate that this immortal DNA strand mechanism exists \"in vivo\" in other types of adult stem cells. In 1996 Nik Zeps published the first paper demonstrating label retaining cells were present in the mouse mammary gland and this was confirmed in 2005 by Gilbert Smith who also published evidence that a subset of mouse mammary epithelial cells could retain DNA label and release DNA label in a manner consistent with the immortal DNA strand mechanism. Soon after, scientists from the laboratory of Derek van der Kooy showed that mice have neural stem cells that are BrdU-retaining and continue to be mitotically active. Asymmetric segregation of DNA was shown using real-time imaging of cells in culture. In 2006, scientists in the lab of Shahragim Tajbakhsh presented evidence that muscle satellite cells, which are proposed to be adult stem cells of the skeletal muscle compartment, exhibited asymmetric segregation of BrdU-labelled DNA when put into culture. They also had evidence that demonstrated BrdU release kinetics consistent with an immortal DNA strand mechanism were operating \"in vivo\", using juvenile mice and mice with muscle regeneration induced by freezing.\\n\\nThese experiments supporting the immortal strand hypothesis, however, are not conclusive. While the Lark experiments demonstrated co-segregation, the co-segregation may have been an artifact of radiation from the tritium. Although Potten identified the cycling, label-retaining cells as adult stem cells, these cells are difficult to identify unequivocally as adult stem cells. While the engineered cells provide an elegant model for co-segregation of chromosomes, studies with these cells were done \"in vitro\" with engineered cells. Some features may not be present \"in vivo\" or may be absent \"in vitro\". In May 2007 evidence in support of the Immortal DNA Strand theory was discovered by Michael Conboy et al., using the muscle stem/satellite cell model during tissue regeneration, where there is tremendous cell division during a relatively brief period of time. Using two BrdU analogs to label template and newly synthesized DNA strands, they saw that about half of the dividing cells in regenerating muscle sort the older \"Immortal\" DNA to one daughter cell and the younger DNA to the other. In keeping with the stem cell hypothesis, the more undifferentiated daughter typically inherited the chromatids with the older DNA, while the more differentiated daughter inherited the younger DNA.\\n\\nExperimental evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis is sparse. In one study, researchers incorporated tritiated thymidine into dividing murine epidermal basal cells. They followed the release of tritiated thymidine after various chase periods, but the pattern of release was not consistent with the immortal strand hypothesis. Although they found label-retaining cells, they were not within the putative stem cell compartment. With increasing lengths of time for the chase periods, these label-retaining cells were located farther from the putative stem cell compartment, suggesting that the label-retaining cells had moved. However, finding conclusive evidence against the immortal strand hypothesis has proven difficult.\\n\\nSection::::Further models.\\nAfter Cairns first proposed the immortal DNA strand mechanism, the theory has undergone several refinements.\\n\\nIn 2002, he proposed that in addition to using immortal DNA strand mechanisms to segregate DNA, when the immortal DNA strands of adult stem cells undergo damage, they will choose to die (apoptose) rather than use DNA repair mechanisms that are normally used in non-stem cells. \\nEmmanuel David Tannenbaum and James Sherley developed a quantitative model describing how repair of point mutations might differ in adult stem cells. They found that in adult stem cells, repair was most efficient if they used an immortal DNA strand mechanism for segregating DNA, rather than a random segregation mechanism. This method would be beneficial because it avoids wrongly fixing DNA mutations in both DNA strands and propagating the mutation.\\n\\nSection::::Mechanisms.\\nThe complete proof of a concept generally requires a plausible mechanism that could mediate the effect. Although controversial, there is a suggestion that this could be provided by the Dynein Motor. This paper is accompanied by a comment summarizing the findings and background.\\n\\nHowever, this work has highly respected biologists among its detractors as exemplified by a further comment on a paper by the same authors from 2006.

Coleman\\'s outburst could have been due to members of Chute Boxe entering the ring. Despite this, Silva and other Chute Boxe members attacked Coleman in the ring, Baroni took Silva to the ground and Wanderlei had to be restrained with a foot placed on his head. Following the event, Coleman approached Chute Boxe to apologize, but the Chute Boxe fighters turned him away.\\n\\nSection::::PRIDE 32 The Real Deal.\\nTeam Hammer House was heavily represented at Pride FC\\'s first American show, PRIDE 32 in Las Vegas on October 21, 2006, being involved in three of the eight fights including the main event.

Rutherford also obtained a temporary restraining order against him the following month.\\n\\nGiersch\\'s U.S. visa was revoked in April 2012, after Rutherford\\'s lawyer informed the State Department about issues pertaining to Giersch\\'s businesses, which led the Department to conclude that they had sufficient evidence to deport him.\\n\\nIt has been reported that the allegations involved fraud or an involvement in drugs and weapons dealing in South America, considered terrorism under the Victory Act. Giersch consequently was unable to enter the United States and took up residence in France and Monaco. In May 2012, Rutherford and Giersch\\'s children went to France to spend the summer with their father. Rutherford asked the court to grant her sole custody so that she could keep the children primarily in the United States following their visit to France, as the existing joint custody agreement required her to travel frequently to enable Giersch to spend time with the children.\\n\\nIn August 2012, in a widely reported decision, a California Superior Court judge ruled that the 50/50 custody arrangement should remain and that, because Giersch is unable to travel to the United States, the children should live in France with him and attend school there, with Rutherford traveling there to visit them. Though Rutherford opposed the decision and requested a stay of proceedings while she appealed, her request was denied and it was ruled that, in two years, his eligibility to enter the United States and the consequent well-being of the children will be reassessed.\\n\\nIn June 2013, Rutherford filed for bankruptcy, stating she had debts of approximately $2 million, primarily due to the $1.5 million she spent on legal fees relating to the divorce and custody dispute with Giersch.\\n\\nIn May 2015, Rutherford was granted temporary sole custody of her children, following a ruling that both her son and daughter be brought back to the United States from Monaco, where they had been living with their father since 2012. On July 23, 2015, a California judge ruled that California did not have jurisdiction over Rutherford\\'s child custody case because she resides in New York, and her former husband was again awarded custody.\\n\\nRutherford then filed a case in New York but on July 27, 2015, the New York court ruled it also did not have jurisdiction.\\n\\nIn December 2015, the Monaco courts reconfirmed that full custody remained with the children\\'s father, with Rutherford granted extensive visitation rights in France and Monaco as well as shared input regarding \"health, schooling, religious education and any change of residence\".\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kelly Rutherford', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=719194'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'bQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7193238', 'text': 'Paul H.

Besides twelve books of artistic and scholarly prose, his essays and short stories have been published in the \"Los Angeles Times\", \"Partisan Review\", \"North American Review\", \"San Francisco Chronicle\", \"Prism International\", and many other American and Canadian periodicals. His fiction has also appeared in Russian, Polish, and Israeli journals. A three-time recipient of the New Jersey State Council on the Arts fellowships in writing, he has also received numerous grants for writing both fiction and non-fiction from the City University of New York. Draitser has given numerous public lectures and book talks at universities and cultural centers in the United States, Canada, UK, Israel, Australia, New Zealand, and Russia.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nDraitser grew up in a Jewish family in the Soviet Union in the post-World War II years, in the anti-Semitic atmosphere of late Stalinism, at a time when Jews were forced to be silent about their religion and often tried to change their Jewish names. It was an oppressive childhood filled with suspicion and mistrust. As a young student, Draitser excelled at literature and decided that he wanted to be a journalist, despite his mother\\'s preference that he study engineering. At that time, Jews attempting to enter the humanities encountered resistance, as Soviet system saw those areas as politically vulnerable and felt that Jews entering them would try to subvert the system. Despite this, Draitser earned degrees first in engineering, and later in journalism.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nDraitser has published both fiction and nonfiction since 1965. His work has appeared in leading Russian journals (including \"Youth, Literary Gazette\", and \"Crocodile\") under his pen name \\'Emil Abramov\\'. He began his writing career as a freelancer contributing satirical articles to Soviet newspapers and magazines, though he had to be careful about what he wrote. For example, while he could criticize a particular factory for the poor workmanship of goods it produced, he could not criticize the economic system as a whole, although it became increasingly clear to him that the lack of competition that would inspire innovation combined with the Soviet mandate to guarantee work for all employees, regardless of their work ethic, made it impossible to produce quality products. Eventually, Draitser wrote an article critical of an important official which led to him being blacklisted, and prompted him to leave for the United States. \\nIn 1975, he settled in Los Angeles, where he earned a Ph.D. in Russian literature from the University of California, Los Angeles. In 1986, he accepted a position at Hunter College in New York City, where he continues to teach. His first book published in the United States, \"Forbidden Laughter\" (1980) brought him national attention. Feature articles on him and his book appeared in \"The New York Times<nowiki></nowiki>\", Washington Post, and the Los Angeles Times. He has appeared on \"NBC News with Tom Brokaw\", the \"Merv Griffin Show<nowiki></nowiki>\", and National Public Radio.\\n\\nDraitser\\'s research and writing have been supported by grants from the American Council of Learned Societies, the Memorial Foundation for Jewish Culture, the Social Science Foundation, and numerous grants from the City University of New York. A three-time recipient of fellowships from the New Jersey State Council on the Arts, he has been awarded residencies at the Vermont Arts Studios, Byrdcliffe Woodstock Art Colony, Renaissance House, and Banff Center for the Arts (Canada).

The arena is owned and operated by the Fairbanks North Star Borough. Originally constructed as an airplane hangar for the Lend-Lease program in Tanacross, southeast of Fairbanks, the building was dismantled, transported to Fairbanks and reassembled in 1968. It has undergone two major renovations since then. The building is home to the Fairbanks Ice Dogs ice hockey team. The borough\\'s parks and recreation department is headquartered in the building.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nPrior to 1968, the building now known as the Big Dipper was an aircraft hangar located in Tanacross, Alaska. Constructed during World War II, the building saw little use after the war.\\n\\nIn 1968, Hez Ray, a teacher and coach at Lathrop High School, organized a crew of high school students and volunteers and undertook a project to move the derelict hangar to Fairbanks and repurpose it as an ice skating arena. Coach Rayâs initial group of boys were âFirst Boots on the Groundâ in the beginning of the enormous project. The incredible story of this adventure is in Coach Rayâs book âThe Big Dipper, A Dream is Bornâ. (Copyright Hez Ray, 2014) () The group purchased the hangar for a dollar and, using equipment donated by Fairbanks construction companies, dismantled the building and moved it to Fairbanks. The volunteers then reconstructed the building in its present location from the dismantled parts of the hangar. After rebuilding the hangar, the volunteers built an ice rink and bleachers inside, but due to a lack of resources the building itself was reconstructed essentially as it had been in Tanacross. Heated restrooms and locker rooms with showers were added in 1972-1973. The building itself remained unheated until its 1980s renovation, with large portable space heaters normally associated with airplane hangars used on occasion in the winter, in an attempt to provide some heat to the facility during events.\\n\\nThe Alaska Gold Kings, a hockey team which began in 1975 as a league team sponsored by the Teamsters Union Local 959, played at the Dipper for more than two decades before moving to Colorado Springs, Colorado. The World Eskimo Indian Olympics was held in the building for most of its existence. When the Dipper was unavailable due to renovations, WEIO decided to hold their 2007 event at the Sullivan Arena in Anchorage, the first time it was held outside of Fairbanks. As an enticement to remain in Fairbanks, WEIO was offered the Carlson Center in place of the Dipper for future events, where it has been held since.\\n', 'title': 'Big Dipper Ice Arena', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7200638'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7200799', 'text': 'Jonas SnÃ¤ckmark\\n\\nJonas \"SnÃ¤ckan\" SnÃ¤ckmark (born 27 January 1986 in Halmstad, Halland County, Sweden) is a Swedish metal-singer who stood out as one of the eleven finalists in Idol 2006 - the Swedish version of Idol.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Jonas SnÃ¤ckmark', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7200799'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7203963', 'text': \"Giants Challenge\\n\\nThe Giants Challenge is a one-day mountain-bike marathon held in April in the rugged and picturesque Giant's Castle area of the Drakensberg Mountains in South Africa.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Giants Challenge', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7203963'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'eAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7206755', 'text': 'Tom Nieporte\\n\\nThomas Nieporte (October 21, 1928 â December 21, 2014) was an American professional golfer who played on the PGA Tour in the 1950s and 1960s.\\n\\nNieporte grew up in the Cincinnati suburb of North College Hill, Ohio.

It is currently held by Labor Party MP Coralee O\\'Rourke.\\n\\nSection::::Overview.\\nThe seat is one of four within the Townsville urban area in North Queensland. Significant utilities within the Mundingburra electorate are the Townsville Hospital, the Douglas Campus of James Cook University and Stockland Shoppingcentre. Suburbs of the Electorate include; Heatley, Cranbrook, Aitkenvale, Mundingburra, Vincent, Douglas, Annandale, Gulliver, Mysterton, Rosslea, part of Kirwan and Pimlico north of the Ross River.\\n\\nMundingburra Electorate is bordered by the Burdekin (South), Townsville (North and East) and Thuringowa (West) Electorates.\\n\\nSection::::Electoral history.\\nThe first incarnation of the Mundingburra electorate was created at the 1911 redistribution, encompassing parts of the former electorates of Herbert and Bowen. It was a historically Labor seat, but from 1944 onwards was held by North Queensland Labor Party MP Tom Aikens. It changed significantly in a 1949 redistribution, and was abolished in 1959, with most of the district becoming part of the new Townsville South electorate.\\n\\nSection::::1996 by-election.\\nThe Mundingburra electoral district attracted national attention and headlines in early 1996 with a by-election called after the Court of Disputed Returns declared the result in the seat from July 1995 election void. The result had taken over a week to determine and ended up with the incumbent member, Ken Davies of the Labor Party, winning by 16 votes. This gave the Goss government a one-seat majority in Parliament - 45 seats to the Coalition\\'s 43 and one conservative-leaning independent, Liz Cunningham. Davies was subsequently appointed as Minister for Emergency Services and Consumer Affairs.\\n\\nThe Liberals challenged the result in August and on 8 December, the court ordered a new election, partly on the basis that administrative difficulties had deprived several military personnel serving in Rwanda of their vote. It was generally understood that the fate of the Goss government likely rested on the result, and Goss himself was prominent in it, announcing amongst other things a A$1 billion Korean zinc smelter for Townsville and asking voters to end the uncertainty \"bedevilling\" the Queensland political system. An expected federal election in March 1996 where the unpopular Keating Government (also Labor) would face the voters was a key feature in the background.\\n\\nThings became somewhat chaotic when Labor, on the basis of internal polling data and a legal case between Davies and the Commonwealth Bank, decided to drop Davies as its endorsed candidate, selecting Tony Mooney, the mayor of Townsville in his place. Davies reacted angrily, ultimately running as an independent and generating a considerable level of media publicity. A total of 12 candidates supporting a raft of causes ended up nominating by the draw of ballot papers on 12 January. On 25 January, Keating called the federal election for 2 March, which Goss described as an \"outside distraction\".\\n\\nContradictory polls generally suggested the Coalition would win, although a late poll by AGB McNair two days before polling day suggested Labor could still win. However, on the day, a swing of 2.83% to the Liberals saw their candidate Frank Tanti, a shop manager and committed Christian who had run a low-level doorknocking campaign for months, win the by-election. Within days, it became clear that Independent Liz Cunningham would support the Coalition, and the Goss government resigned, allowing Rob Borbidge to form a minority government which lasted until the 1998 election. At that election, Labor, under Peter Beattie, won back both Mundingburra and governing party status.\\n', 'title': 'Electoral district of Mundingburra', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7207251'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ewE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7207738', 'text': 'Innocent Ntsume\\n\\nInnocent Ntsume (born 7 July 1980) is a South African professional footballer who plays as a midfielder.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nNtsume began his professional career in 1999 with Jomo Cosmos, before moving to FC AK in August 2008.

Since then, there have been dozens of suicide attacks within and outside the republic of Chechnya, resulting in thousands of casualties among Russian security personnel and civilians. The profiles of the suicide bombers have varied, as have the circumstances surrounding the bombings.\\n\\nAlthough the most publicized Chechen suicide attacks have taken place in Moscow, most attacks have occurred in Chechnya, while several additional attacks have taken place in the extended North Caucasus region and particular the neighboring Russian republic of Ingushetia. The majority of suicide bombings, targeting military installations and government compounds in and around Chechnya and also top government officials, have been directed against those whom the separatists consider to be combatants.\\n\\nSection::::Summary.\\nAs of 2009, most of the bombers appear to be ethnic Chechens, with a few known exceptions. Although some of the attacks may have also been carried out by Ingush, an ethnic group closely related to the Chechens (the Ingush bear a separate set of grudges against Russia, including Russian support of the Ossetian side of the East Prigorodny Conflict), none have occurred in the republics of Dagestan and Kabardino-Balkaria or with any known involvement of local rebel groups there.\\n\\nThere is no evidence of any foreign involvement in either the planning or execution of Chechen attacks aside from the inspiration from the tactics employed in the ArabâIsraeli conflict. In contrast to Palestinian suicide bombers, whose families are offered large cash rewards, no financial rewards are given. Female suicide bombers, referred to as \"\"shahidka\"\" by Chechens (meaning a female Islamic martyr) or \"Black Widows\" by Russians (as they have often had their husbands [and/or children] killed by the Russian army or the Kadyrovtsy), comprise a clear majority of Chechen suicide attackers; this trend stands in direct contrast to ongoing suicide bomb campaigns in Israel and Iraq, where women constitute only a small minority of suicide bombers.\\n\\nWhat is also somewhat unusual about Chechen bombing is that although the tactics used are largely similar to those used by Islamic militants, religion is usually not the cited motivation, despite Russian claims. For example, female bomber Khava Barayeva stated that she attacked in the name of Chechen independence, and urged more Chechens to do the same for their national honor.\\n\\nFamily members of identified bombers often suffer severe reprisals (beatings, arson attacks, kidnappings, torture and murder) at the hands of masked gunmen presumed to be government agents and members of pro-Kremlin militias, although the same may be said about the relatives of all Chechen rebels.\\n\\nThrough the first five years of the Chechen-Russian conflict (including the First Chechen War and most of the first year of the Second Chechen War), there were no planned suicide bombings related to Chechnya. The highest concentrations of suicide attacks to date occurred in the following time periods:\\n\\nRadical rebel commander Shamil Basayev and his extremist gang, Riyadus-Salikhin Reconnaissance and Sabotage Battalion of Chechen Martyrs, claimed responsibility for many of them.\\n\\nIn late 2004, following the Beslan disaster, attacks (excluding those against the Kadyrov regime) ceased for four years due to major changes in tactics employed by the separatist movement. The reason for this was cited as a certain amount of shame over Beslan on the part of the Chechen separatists. A spokesman said in 2004 that \"A bigger blow could not have been dealt on us. ... People around the world will think that Chechens are beasts and monsters if they could attack children.\"\\n\\nThe bombings resumed by 2008 and in April 2009. Caucasus Emirate leader Doku Umarov announced the reactivation of the Riyadus-Salikhin extremist gang, which had been disbanded in 2006 at the behest of Umarov\\'s predecessor Sheikh Abdul Halim. Numerous attacks were then conducted during what Umarov called the \"year of offensive\".

From June 2001 to November 2002 he was the republic's Prime Minister and for a time Jergenia looked to be the favourite to succeed Abkhazia's first president Vladislav Ardzinba.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nJergenia was born on 8 August 1941 in Leningrad, Russian SFSR, Soviet Union. He graduated from the Moscow State University with a diploma in Law in 1963. During Soviet times, he held several offices within the administration of the Abkhazian Autonomous Soviet Socialist Republic: investigator at the Interior Ministry, chief investigator of the Prosecutorâs Office of Sukhumi, Public Court Chairman of Sukhumi and member of the Supreme Court of the\\nAbkhazian ASSR.\\n\\nAfter the break-up of the Soviet Union, from 1992 to 2001, Jergenia served as the Prosecutor General of the Republic of Abkhazia, as which, amongst other things, he had to defend Abkhazia's treatment of its prisoners of war. On 14 April 1999 Jergenia was re-appointed by the People's Assembly to a second term as Prosecutor General only after several rounds of voting.\\n\\nFrom 1990 to 2002 Jergenia was the chief negotiator and designated representative at the Georgian-Abkhazian peace for President Vladislav Ardzinba. In this capacity, he personally handled most of the negotiations with Russia, Georgia, the United States and the United Nations.\\n\\nSection::::Prime minister.\\nJergenia was appointed to the post of Prime Minister June 7, 2001. Due to President Ardzinba's deteriorating health, Jergenia could lead Abkhazia politically, unlike previous Prime Ministers, who had mainly concerned themselves with economic policy. Perhaps even more so than other Abkhazian politicians, he was pro-Russian, and vociferously opposed to reunification with Georgia. Jergenia openly discussed working towards associate membership of Russia and encouraged Abkhazians to take up Russian passports, which a large percentage of the population eventually did. He also pledged a military alliance with Eduard Kokoity, President of South Ossetia to discourage Georgia from attacking either entity.\\n\\nOn 29 November 2002, Jergenia was fired by President Ardzinba, officially due to his failure to ensure fulfillment of budget targets and to prepare adequately for winter. However, for the first nine months of that year budget had been implemented fully and Jergenia's dismissal was widely seen as politically motivated. At the moment of his sacking, he had just returned from Moscow where he had signed a contract on supplying electricity to Krasnodar krai from Abkhazia, and he was widely seen at the time as the main candidate for succeeding Ardzinba as president. The President's wife, Svetlana Ardzinba, was Jergenia's first cousin, and Jergenia was thought to have been building up support in Moscow. Some think that Ardzinba found that Jergenia was too openly ambitious about the presidency, that he put Russian interests above Abkhazian interest, or that he dropped support for Jergenia due to his unpopularity with the Abkhazian population.\\n\\nJergenia was replaced by former Prime Minister Gennady Gagulia. This led to a shift in Abkhazian foreign policy, as Jergenia, while still steadfast on the question of independence, was much more open to negotiations than his successor.\\n\\nJergenia had been a close friend and collaborator of Ardzinba since the 1970s, but the two fell out when Ardzinba dismissed Jergenia as Prime Minister. They reconciled after Ardzinba retired as President in 2005.\\n\\nSection::::2004 Presidential elections.\\nAlready during the 2002 Parliamentary elections, while still Prime Minister, Jergenia had supported the parliamentary candidates of public movement Amtsakhara. In 2003, he spoke at Amtsakhara's congress, where he argued in favour of reducing Presidential powers and moving towards a mixed presidential/parliamentary model of government. Jergenia then became Amtsakhara's favoured candidate for the October 2004 presidential elections before it entered into an alliance with United Abkhazia and chose to back Sergei Bagapsh instead. A minority faction of Amtsakhara continued its support for Jergenia, and he did enter into the elections, with Ruslan Kishmaria as his Vice-Presidential candidate, head of the Gali district assembly. The pair came in only fourth place in the first round, receiving 2277 votes, and did not contest the second.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Anri Jergenia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=722036'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'iAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7221128', 'text': 'Fabio Bidini\\n\\nFabio Bidini (born in Arezzo on 11 June 1968) is an Italian pianist.

She traveled west in the early 1880s to teach school in Ojai, California; her letters about the trip were later published in the California Historical Quarterly (1937â1938). She was a Protestant Christian missionary in Northern China and belonged to the so-called \"missionary generation\" of Americans born between the years 1860 - 1885.\\n\\nSection::::Early years and children.\\nTo honor the example of a beloved cousin who had died in mission work in China, Anna Seward decided to travel there as a Presbyterian missionary and settled in Huang Xian, Shandong province in North China, where she met Cicero Washington Pruitt. They married on February 16, 1888, and had five children: Ida (1888â1985), John (1890â1912), Ashley (1892â1898), Virginia (died in infancy, 1894), Robert (1897â1961), and Dudley McConnell \"Mac\" (1902â1967). The death of Ashley and Virginia inspired Southern Baptists to send money to start a hospital in Huang Xian. The famous missionary Lottie Moon apparently babysat the children on some occasions. Ida was one of the few Westerners that remained influential in Chinese Aid and Development throughout much of the century even after the communist take over. While stationed in Huangxian, the children attended school at the Chefoo School operated by the China Inland Mission. Anna Seward began a missionary school for boys, and by 1904 C.W. Pruitt had organized the Baptist Theological Seminary for Central China.\\n\\nSection::::Writings and later years.\\nAnna wrote two books about missionary life in China: The Day of Small Things (Foreign Mission Board, Southern Baptist Convention, 1929) and Up from Zero: In North China (Broadman Press, 1939). She also wrote two children\\'s books set in China: The Chinese Boat Baby (Rice Press, 1938) and Whirligigs in China: Stories for Juniors (Broadman, 1948). After C.W. retired in 1936, they returned to the United States and settled in Atlanta where he became the dean of the Baptist Foreign Missions of North America.

Hesselblad is also recognized as a Righteous Among the Nations due to her efforts in World War II saving the lives of Jewish people during the genocide of the Holocaust.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nSection::::Early life and conversion.\\nMaria Elizabeth Hesselblad born on 4 June 1870 as the fifth of thirteen children born to August Robert Hesselblad and Cajsa Petersdotter Dag â Lutheran parents from FÃ¥glavik in VÃ¤stra GÃ¶taland County; she had a brother: Thur. She was baptized the following month and received into the Lutheran Church of Sweden in her parish of Hudene.\\n\\nBy 1886, she had to work to help them make ends meet. At first she looked for work in Sweden, but eventually emigrated to the United States of America in 1888, where she studied nursing at Roosevelt Hospital in New York City. While there, she did home nursing, which brought her into contact with the Catholic faith of many of the poor for whom she cared. She developed an interest in that faith while deep prayer and personal study led her down the path of conversion, and on 15 August 1902 â the Feast of the Assumption â she received conditional baptism from a Jesuit priest, Johann Georg Hagen, in the chapel of the Georgetown Visitation Monastery in Washington, D.C. Hagen also became her spiritual director. As she reflected on that moment, she wrote: \"In an instant the love of God was poured over me. I understood that I could respond to that love only through sacrifice and a love prepared to suffer for His glory and for the Church. Without hesitation I offered Him my life, and my will to follow Him on the Way of the Cross\". Two days later, she received her First Communion and would depart for Europe.\\n\\nHesselblad approached Hagen and asked that she be received into the Church at once to which Hagen said: \"My dear daughter, how could I do that? I have just met you\". She said: \"My father, forgive me, but I have fought in darkness for twenty years; for many years I have studied the Catholic faith and have prayed for a strong faith ... I now possess this faith, and I am ready to submit to an examination on all the points of doctrine\". Hagen questioned this, and after great consideration told her: \"I see no reason not to receive you unto the Church. Today is August 12, and the 15th will be the Feast of the Assumption of the Blessed Virgin Mary. That day, I will receive you into the Catholic Church; the following Sunday, the 17th, you will be able to receive Holy Communion. Spend these few days in retreat and come to see me twice a day for lessons\". It was in that same year that her brother, Thur, converted to Catholicism.\\n\\nSection::::As a religious.\\nHesselblad then made a pilgrimage to Rome, where she received the sacrament of Confirmation. She also visited the House of Saint Bridget of Sweden there, where the medieval saint had spent the last half of her life, which made a deep impression upon her. At that point she felt called to dedicate her life to the work of Christian unity. She returned to New York City briefly, only to go back to Rome, where, on 25 March 1904, she was welcomed as a guest by the nuns of the Carmelite monastery housed there; Mother Hedwig â the prioress â welcomed her after hesitating to accept her due to her weak health. However, she allowed her on the condition of a period of probation. Yet it was at this point she fell gravely ill and even had to receive the Extreme Unction. She slowly recovered and held out against her family\\'s pleas to return to Sweden.\\n\\nShe petitioned the Holy See to be able to make religious vows under the Rule of the Order which Brigid had founded, and had been a prominent presence in the Church in Sweden before the Protestant Reformation had taken hold there. She received special permission for this from Pope Pius X in 1906, at which time she assumed the Bridgettine religious habit, including its distinctive element of a silver crown. She professed into the hands of Hagen on 22 June 1906, the Feast of the Sacred Heart.\\n\\nHesselblad attempted to revive interest in the order and its founder in both Sweden and Rome. Her proposal to establish a monastery of the order on the site where Bridget had lived received no volunteers from the few monasteries of the order still in existence. Giving up on the intention of following the established way of life in the order, she proposed one which included the care of the sick. To this end she was joined by three young women from England, whom she received on 9 November 1911, with which the new congregation was established. Their particular mission was to pray and work, especially for the conversion of the Scandinavian people to the Catholic Church.\\n\\nHesselblad returned to her homeland of Sweden in 1923, where she was able to establish a community in Djursholm, while she worked nursing the sick poor. The new congregation was established in England in 1931 after receiving the approval of the Holy See. That same year, Hesselblad obtained the House of Saint Bridget in Rome for her new congregation. A foundation was made in India in 1937 which drew many new members. Her order received canonical approval on 7 July 1940.\\n\\nHesselblad became known as \"the second Bridget\". During World War II â and after â she performed many charitable works on the behalf of the poor and those that suffered due to racial laws and also promoted a movement for peace that involved Christians and non-Christians, and she became part of their journey to faith and to the Church. The war also saw her save the lives of Jewish people who would have otherwise have perished in the Holocaust had it not been for her direct intervention.\\n\\nHer apostolic zeal contributed to the conversion of the Baptist Minister Piero Chuminelli â author of a biographical account of Saint Bridget of Sweden â and she also had close ties to the former Chief Rabbi of Rome Israel Zolli (Eugenio) who converted to the faith in 1946.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nHer health declined around the time when officials prepared the canonical visit of her order. On 23 April 1957 she gave her blessing to the sisters and held her raised hands in a solemn gesture in which she murmured: \"Go to Heaven with hands full of love and virtues\". She received the sacraments thereafter.\\n\\nHesselblad died in Rome on 24 April 1957 in the first hours of the morning â it was Easter Wednesday.\\n\\nSection::::Sainthood.\\nSection::::Process and beatification.\\nThe sainthood process commenced in Rome in 1987 and concluded its work in 1990. During this period the Congregation for the Causes of Saints approved the cause and her being granted the title of Servant of God on 4 February 1988 â the first official stage in the process. The diocesan process was ratified on 21 June 1991 which allowed for the submission of the Positio to Rome for further investigation. Theologians granted the cause their approval on 10 November 1998 while the C.C.S. approved it also on 16 March 1999.\\n\\nPope John Paul II proclaimed her to be Venerable on 26 March 1999 after he recognized that she had lived a model Christian life of heroic virtue. The miracle requested for her beatification was investigated in 1996 and received ratification in Rome on 17 October 1998. The pope approved it at the beginning of 2000 allowing for her beatification on the following 9 April 2000.\\n\\nSection::::Canonization.\\nPope Francis approved the second miracle attributed to her on 14 December 2015 which would allow for her future canonization; the date was decided at an ordinary consistory of cardinals on 15 March 2016 and was celebrated in Saint Peter\\'s Square on 5 June 2016.\\n\\nThe miracle was investigated in the diocese of its origin in Cuba in February 2014 â the miracle in question occurred in the late 2000s â and was validated in Rome on 20 June 2014.

Liz Hamilton, a young woman with literary ambitions, and Merry Noel Blake, an all-American blonde beauty from Atlanta, are close friends who met while they were freshmen at Smith College in the 1950s.\\n\\nSoon after graduation, Liz writes a critically acclaimed book and drifts into unfulfilling relationships and one-night stands, including an empty encounter in an airplane lavatory, a fling with a teenaged hustler and an affair with Chris Adams, a young reporter for \"Rolling Stone\". Meanwhile, Merry fulfills her aspiration to a life of domesticity caring for a husband and child by marrying Doug Blake and moving to a beach house in Malibu.\\n\\nAlthough Merry is happy, she can\\'t help but envy Liz for her glamorous career as an author. Merry decides to write a book of her own and, with Liz\\'s assistance, \"A House by the Sea\", a trashy roman Ã  clef about the Malibu colony, finds a publisher and becomes a huge best-seller. Before long Merry is a darling of the media and her fame and fortune surpass those of Liz (who is experiencing a severe case of writer\\'s block), leading to jealousy between the old friends and problems in Merry\\'s marriage.\\n\\nThe film takes place over the course of 22 years, first depicting Merry\\'s and Doug\\'s elopement in 1959, and then picking up during three segments, taking place in 1969, 1975 and 1981, showing changes in the characters\\' relationships (and society) over the course of two decades.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nRobert Mulligan originally was slated to direct, but when members of the American Federation of Television and Radio Artists and the Screen Actors Guild went on strike four days after filming began, the production shut down. Mulligan was forced to withdraw when previous commitments conflicted with the new schedule. The film proved to be the last directed by George Cukor. It also marked the screen debuts of an 8-year-old Nicole Eggert and also Meg Ryan, who played Merry\\'s daughter in the 1969 and 1981 segments, respectively.\\n\\nNew York City locations seen in the film include the Algonquin Hotel and the Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. Additional locations include Madison, New Jersey (standing in for Northampton, Massachusetts), Los Angeles, and Malibu. Interiors were filmed at the Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer Studios in Culver City. Sets were later rented for use in the Biltmore Hotel scenes in the 1984 blockbuster Ghostbusters.\\n\\nNina Foch, Dick Cavett, Ray Bradbury, Merv Griffin, Marsha Hunt, Christopher Isherwood, Gavin Lambert, Roger Vadim, and Paul Morrissey make appearances in the film.\\n\\nThe soundtrack includes \"Take Me for a Buggy Ride\" performed by Bessie Smith and \"On The Sunny Side of the Street\" sung by Willie Nelson.\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nCritics were mixed about the film.\\nVincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" wrote \"The movie can\\'t make up its mind whether it\\'s about a tumultuously difficult but rewarding friendship or whether it\\'s a sendup of the contemporary literary scene. It fails as both...The culprit is Gerald Ayres...[who] has spread his talents very thin...Though he has written two big roles, he doesn\\'t seem capable of writing either a romantic drama, like \"The Turning Point\", or an informed satire...Mr. Ayres can occasionally write good wisecracks...But he has no particular insight into the publishing scene. Nor does he ever convince us of the enduring strength of the friendship that lasts through thick and, more often, thin. Though Misses Bisset and Bergen are appealing actresses, \"Rich and Famous\" doesn\\'t hold together.\"\\n\\nRoger Ebert of the \"Chicago Sun-Times\" observed \"This film is a real curiosity. It\\'s a good-bad movie, like \"The Other Side of Midnight\" or \"The Greek Tycoon\". It contains scenes that make you want to squirm because of their awkwardness and awfulness, and yet you don\\'t want to look away and you\\'re not bored. The movie has the courage to go to extremes, and some of those extremes may not be art but are certainly unforgettable...It\\'s a slick, trashy, entertaining melodrama, with too many dumb scenes to qualify as successful.\"\\n\\n\"Variety\" wrote \"While not without its problems, \"Rich and Famous\" is an absorbing drama of some notable qualities, the greatest of which is a gutsy, fascinating and largely magnificent performance by Jacqueline Bisset...For a bright, sophisticated piece such as this, particularly one under the guidance of the irrepressibly elegant George Cukor, the somewhat harsh, murky visual style is surprising.\"\\n\\n\"TV Guide\" rated the film one out of four stars and commented, \"This could have been â and is â a very funny film; unfortunately, most of the laughs are unintentional...Although his version of Van Druten\\'s play \"Old Acquaintance\" is sexier than the original 1943 screen treatment...it also fails to satisfy on many levels...This glossy soap opera suffers from Cukor\\'s failure to control his actors. Moreover, the costumes are atrocious. The film simply lacks the sophisticated style that made Cukor famous.\"\\n\\nPauline Kael of \"The New Yorker\" stated \"\"Rich and Famous\" isn\\'t camp, exactly: It\\'s more like a homosexual fantasy. Jacqueline Bisset\\'s affairs, with their masochistic overtones, are creepy, because they don\\'t seem like what a woman would get into. And Candice Bergen is used almost as if she were a big, goosey, female impersonator.\"\\n\\n\"Time Out London\" wrote \"Considering neither Bisset nor Bergen had ever shown the slightest acting ability before in movies, their performances in the Bette Davis/Miriam Hopkins roles in this loose reworking of \"Old Acquaintance\" are very capable...Of course much of the credit must go to Cukor, the veteran \\'woman\\'s director\\'; but the film disappoints in its unconfident handling of the secondary characters.\"\\n\\nSection::::Awards and nominations.\\nGerald Ayres won the Writers Guild Award for Best Comedy Adapted from Another Medium.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Rich and Famous (1981 film)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7238599'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'kwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7241443', 'text': 'The Floor Above\\n\\nThe Floor Above is a 1914 American silent mystery film directed by James Kirkwood.

He is one of the most popular and well-known Russian poets of the 20th century.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nSection::::Early life.\\nSergei Yesenin was born in Konstantinovo in Ryazan Governorate of the Russian Empire to a peasant family. His father was Alexander Nikitich Yesenin (1873â1931), his mother Tatyana Fyodorovna (nee Titova, 1875â1955).\\n\\nBoth his parents spent most of their time looking for work, father in Moscow, mother in Ryazan, so at age two Sergei was moved to the nearby village Matovo, to join Fyodor Alexeyevich and Natalya Yevtikhiyevna Titovs, his relatively well-off maternal grandparents, who essentially raised him.\\n\\nThe Titovs had three grown-up sons, and it was they who were Yesenin\\'s early years\\' companions. \"My uncles taught me horse-riding and swimming, one of them... even employed me as hound-dog, when going out to the ponds hunting ducks,\" he later remembered. He started to read aged five, and at nine began to write poetry, inspired originally by chastushkas and folklore, provided mostly by the grandmother whom he also remembered as a highly religious woman who used to take him to every single monastery sheâd choose to visit. He had two younger sisters, Yekaterina (1905â1977), and Alexandra (1911â1981).\\n\\nIn 1904 Yesenin joined the Konstantinovo zemstvo school. In 1909 he graduated it with an honorary certificate, and went on to study in the local secondary parochial school in Spas-Klepiki. From 1910 onwards, he started to write poetry systematically; eight poems dated that year were later included in his 1925 Collected Works. In all, Yesenin wrote around thirty poems during his school years. He compiled them into what was supposed to be his first book which he titled \"Bolnye Dumy\" (Sick Thoughts) and tried to publish it in 1912 in Ryazan, but failed.\\n\\nIn 1912, with a teacherâs diploma, Yesenin moved to Moscow, where he supported himself working as a proofreader\\'s assistant at the Sytin\\'s printing company. The following year he enrolled in Chanyavsky University to study history and philology as an external student, but had to leave it after eighteen months due to lack of funds. In the University he became friends with several aspiring poets, among them Dmitry Semyonovsky, Vasily Nasedkin, Nikolai Kolokolov and Ivan Filipchenko. Yeseninâs first marriage (which lasted three years) was in 1913 to Anna Izryadnova, a co-worker from the publishing house, with whom he had a son, Yuri. 1913 saw Yesenin becoming increasingly interested in Christianity, biblical motives became frequent in his poems. \"Grisha, what I am reading at the moment is the Gospel and find a lot of things which for me are new,\" he wrote to his close childhood friend G. Panfilov. That was also the year when he became involved with the Moscow revolutionary circles: for several months his flat was under secret police surveillance and in September 1913 it was raided and searched.\\n\\nSection::::Life and career.\\nIn January 1914 Yesenin\\'s first published poem \"Beryoza\" (The Birch Tree) appeared in the children\\'s magazine \"Mirok\" (Small World). More appearances followed in minor magazines such as \"Protalinka\" and \"Mlechny Put\". In December 1914 Yesenin quit work \"and gave himself to poetry, writing continually,\" according to his wife. Around this time he became a member of the Surikov Literary and Music circle.\\n\\nIn 1915, exasperated with the lack of interest in his work in Moscow, Yesenin moved to Petrograd. He arrived at the city on 8 March and the next day met Alexander Blok at his home, to read him poetry. He received a warm welcome and soon became acquainted with fellow-poets Sergey Gorodetsky, Nikolai Klyuev and Andrei Bely and well known in literary circles. Blok was especially helpful in promoting Yesenin\\'s early literary career, describing him as \"a gem of a peasant poet\" and his verse as \"fresh, pure and resounding\", even if \"wordy\". The same year he joined the Krasa (Beauty) group of peasant poets which included Klyuyev, Gorodetsky, Sergey Klychkov and Alexander Shiryayevets, among others. In his 1925 autobiography Yesenin said that Bely gave him the meaning of form while Blok and Klyuev taught him lyricism. It was Klyuyev who introduced Yesenin to the publisher Averyanov, who in early 1916 released his debut poetry collection \"Radunitsa\" which featured many of his early spiritual-themed verse. \"I would have eagerly relinquished some of my religious poems, large and small, but they make sense as an illustration of poets\\' progress towards the revolution,\" he would later write. Yesenin and Klyuyev maintained close and intimate friendship which lasted several years.\\n\\nIn 1915 Yesenin became a co-founder of the Krasa literary group and published numerous poems in the Petrograd magazines \"Russkaya Mysl\", \"Ezhemesyachny Zhurnal\", \"Novy Zhurnal Dlya Vsekh\", \"Golos Zhizni\" and \"Niva\". Among the authors he met later in the year were Maxim Gorky, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Nikolai Gumilyov and Anna Akhmatova; he also visited painter Ilya Repin in his Penaty. Yesenin\\'s rise to fame was meteoric; by the end of the year he became the star of St Petersburg\\'s literary circles and salons. \"The city took to him with the delight a gourmet reserves for strawberries in winter. A barrage of praise hit him, excessive and often insincere,\" Maxim Gorky wrote to Romain Rolland.\\nOn 25 March 1916, Yesenin was drafted for military duty and in April joined a medical train based in Tsarskoye Selo, under the command of colonel D.N. Loman. In 22 July 1916, at a special concert attended by the Empress Alexandra Fyodorovna (the train\\'s patron) and her daughters, Yesenin recited his poems \"Rus\" and \"In Scarlet Fireglow\". \"The Empress told me my poems were beautiful, but sad. I replied, the same could be said about Russia as a whole,\" he recalled later. His relationships with Loman soon deteriorated. In October, Yesenin declined the colonel\\'s offer to write (with Klyuyev) and have published a book of pro-monarchist verses, and spent twenty days under arrest as a consequence.\\n\\nIn March 1917, Yesenin was sent to the Warrant Officers School but soon deserted the Kerensky\\'s army. In August 1917 (having divorced Izryadnova a year earlier) Yesenin married for a second time, to Zinaida Raikh (later an actress and the wife of Vsevolod Meyerhold). They had two children, a daughter Tatyana and a son Konstantin. The parents subsequently quarreled and lived separately for some time prior to their divorce in 1921. Tatyana became a writer and journalist and Konstantin Yesenin would become a well-known soccer statistician.\\n\\nYesenin supported the February Revolution. \"If not for [it], I might have withered away on useless religious symbolism,\" he wrote later. He greeted the rise of the Bolsheviks too. \"In the Revolution I was all on the side of the October, even if perceiving everything in my own peculiar way, from a peasant\\'s standpoint,\" he remembered in his 1925 autobiography. Later he criticized the Bolshevik rule, in such poems as \"The Stern October Has Deceived Me\". \"I feel very sad now, for we are going through such a period in [our] history when human individuality is being destroyed, and the approaching socialism is totally different from the one I was dreaming of,\" he wrote in an August 1920 letter to his friend Yevgeniya Livshits. \"I never joined the RKP, being further to the left than them,\" he maintained in his 1922 autobiography.\\nArtistically, the revolutionary years were exciting time for Yesenin. Among the important poems he wrote in 1917-1918 were \"Prishestviye\" (The Advent), \"Peobrazheniye\" (Transformation, which gave the title to the 1918 collection), and \"Inoniya\". In February 1918, after the Sovnarkom issued the \"Socialist Homeland is in Danger!\" decree-appeal, he joined the esers\\' military unit. He actively participated in the magazine \"Nash Put\" (Our Way), as well as the almanacs Skify (Ð¡ÐºÐ¸ÑÑ) and Krasny Zvon (in February his large poem \"Marfa Posadnitsa\" appeared in one of the latter). In September 1918 Yesenin co-founded (with Andrey Bely, Pyotr Oreshin, Lev Povitsky and Sergey Klychkov) the publishing house Ð¢ÑÑÐ´Ð¾Ð²Ð°Ñ ÐÑÑÐµÐ»Ñ Ð¥ÑÐ´Ð¾Ð¶Ð½Ð¸ÐºÐ¾Ð² Ð¡Ð»Ð¾Ð²Ð° (the Labor Artel of the Artists of the Word) which reissued (in six books) all that he\\'d written by this time.\\n\\nIn September 1918, Yesenin became friends with Anatoly Marienhof, with whom he founded the Russian literary movement of imaginism. Describing their group\\'s general appeal, he wrote in 1922: \"Prostitutes and bandits are our fans. With them, we are pals. Bolsheviks do not like us due to some kind of misunderstanding.\" In January 1919, Yesenin signed the Imaginists\\' Manifest. In February he, Marienhof and Vadim Shershenevich, founded the Imaginists publishing house. Before that, Yesenin became a member of the Moscow Union of Professional Writers and several months later was elected a member of the All-Russian Union of Poets. Two of his books, \"Kobyliyu Korabli\" (Mare\\'s Ships) and \"Klyuchi Marii\" (The Keys of Mary) came out later that year.\\nIn JulyâAugust 1920, Yesenin toured the Russian South, starting in Rostov-on-Don and ending in Tiflis, Georgia. In November 1920, he met Galina Benislavskaya, his future secretary and close friend. That year, he experienced his first serious trouble with the authorities. Following an anonymous report, he and two of his Imaginist friends, brothers Alexander and Ruben Kusikovs, were arrested by the Cheka in October but released a week later on the solicitation of his friend Yakov Blumkin. In the course of that year, the publication of three of Yesenin\\'s books were refused by publishing house Goslitizdat. His \"Triptych\" collection came out through the Skify Publishers in Berlin. Next year saw the collections \"Confessions of a Hooligan\" (January) and \"Treryaditsa\" (February) published. The drama in verse \"Pygachov\" came out in December 1921, to much acclaim.\\n\\nIn May 1921 he visited a friend, the poet Alexander Shiryaevets, in Tashkent, giving poetry readings and making a short trip to Samarkand. In the fall of 1921, while visiting the studio of painter Georgi Yakulov, Yesenin met the Paris-based American dancer Isadora Duncan, a woman 18 years his senior. She knew only a dozen words in Russian, and he spoke no foreign languages. Nevertheless, they married on 2 May 1922. Yesenin accompanied his celebrity wife on a tour of Europe and the United States. His marriage to Duncan was brief and in May 1923, he returned to Moscow. In his 1922 autobiography, Yesenin wrote: \"Russia\\'s recent nomadic past does not appeal to me, and I am all for civilization. But I dislike America intensely. America is a stinking place where not just art is being murdered, but with it, all the loftiest aspirations of humankind. If it\\'s America that we are looking up to, as [a model for our] future, then I\\'d rather stay under our greyish skies... We do not have those skyscrapers that\\'s managed to produce up to date nothing but Rockefeller and McCormick, but here Tolstoy, Dostoyevsky, Pushkin and Lermontov were born.\"\\n\\nIn 1923 Yesenin became romantically involved with the actress Augusta Miklashevskaya to whom he dedicated several poems, among them those of the \"Hooligan\\'s Love\" cycle. In the same year, he had a son by the poet Nadezhda Volpina. Alexander Esenin-Volpin grew up to become a poet and a prominent activist in the Soviet dissident movement of the 1960s. Since 1972, till his death in 2016, he lived in the United States as a famous mathematician and teacher.\\n\\nAs Yesenin\\'s popularity grew, stories began to circulate about his heavy drinking and consequent public outbursts. In autumn 1923, he was arrested in Moscow twice and underwent a series of enquiries from the OGPU secret police. Fellow poet Vladimir Mayakovsky, wrote that, after his return from America, Yesenin became more visible in newspaper police log sections than in poetry.\\n\\nMore serious were the accusations of anti-Semitism against Yesenin and three of his close friends, fellow poets, Sergey Klytchkov, Alexei Ganin and Pyotr Oreshin, made by Lev Sosnovsky, a prominent journalist and close Trotsky associate. The foursome retorted with an open letter in \"Pravda\" and, in December, were cleared by the Writers\\' Union burlaw court. It was later suggested, though, that Yesenin\\'s departure to the Caucasus in the summer of 1924 might have been a direct result of the harassment by the NKVD. Earlier that year, fourteen writers and poets, including his friend Ganin, were arrested as the alleged members of the (apparently fictitious) Order of the Russian Fascists, then tortured and executed in March without trial.\\n\\nIn JanuaryâApril 1924, Yesenin was arrested and interrogated four times. In February, he entered the Sheremetev hospital, then was moved into the Kremlin clinic in March. Nevertheless, he continued to make public recitals and released several books in the course of the year, including \"Moskva Kabatskaya\". In August 1924 Yesenin and fellow poet Ivan Gruzinov published a letter in \"Pravda\", announcing the end of the Imaginists.\\n\\nIn early 1925 Yesenin met and married Sophia Andreyevna Tolstaya (1900-1957), a granddaughter of Leo Tolstoy. In May what proved to be his final large poem \"Anna Snegina\" came out. During the year, he compiled and edited The Works by Yesenin in three volumes which was published by Gosizdat posthumously.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nOn 28 December 1925, Yesenin was found dead in the room in the Hotel Angleterre in St Petersburg. His last poem \"Goodbye my friend, goodbye\" (ÐÐ¾ ÑÐ²Ð¸Ð´Ð°Ð½ÑÑ, Ð´ÑÑÐ³ Ð¼Ð¾Ð¹, Ð´Ð¾ ÑÐ²Ð¸Ð´Ð°Ð½ÑÑ) according to Wolf Ehrlich was written by him the day before he died. Yesenin complained that there was no ink in the room, and he was forced to write with his blood.\\n\\nAccording to his biographers, the poet was in a state of depression and committed suicide by hanging.\\n\\nAfter the funeral in the Union in Leningrad, poet Yesenin\\'s body was transported by train to Moscow, where a farewell for relatives and friends of the deceased was also arranged. He was buried December 31, 1925, in Moscow\\'s Vagankovskoye Cemetery. His grave is marked by a white marble sculpture.\\n\\nA theory exists that Yesenin\\'s death was actually a murder by OGPU agents who staged it to look like suicide. The novel \"Yesenin\" published by Vitali Bezrukov is devoted to this version of Yesenin\\'s death. In 2005 TV serial \"Sergey Yesenin\" based on this novel (with Sergey Bezrukov playing Yesenin) was shown on Channel One Russia. Facts tending to support the assassination hypothesis were cited by Stanislav Kunyaev and Sergey Kunyaev in the final chapter of their biography of Yesenin.\\n\\nEnraged by his death, Mayakovsky composed a poem called \"To Sergei Yesenin\", where the resigned ending of Yesenin\\'s death poem is countered by these verses: \"in this life it is not hard to die, / to mold life is more difficult.\" In a later lecture on Yesenin, he said that the revolution demanded \"that we glorify life.\" However, Mayakovsky himself would commit suicide in 1930.\\n\\nSection::::Cultural impact.\\nYesenin\\'s suicide triggered an epidemic of copycat suicides by his mostly female fans. For example, Galina Benislavskaya, his ex-girlfriend, killed herself by his graveside in December 1926. Although he was one of Russia\\'s most popular poets and had been given an elaborate state funeral, some of his writings were banned by the Kremlin during the reigns of Joseph Stalin and Nikita Khrushchev. Nikolai Bukharin\\'s criticism of Yesenin contributed significantly to the banning. Only in 1966 were most of his works republished. Today Yesenin\\'s poems are taught to Russian schoolchildren; many have been set to music and recorded as popular songs. His early death, coupled with unsympathetic views by some of the literary elite, adoration by ordinary people, and sensational behavior, all contributed to the enduring and near mythical popular image of the Russian poet.\\n\\nBernd Alois Zimmermann included his poetry in his \"Requiem fÃ¼r einen jungen Dichter\" (\"Requiem for a Young Poet\"), completed in 1969.\\n\\nThe Ryazan State University is named in his honor.\\n\\nSection::::In popular culture.\\nYesenin appears as a character in the 1981 ballet \"Isadora\", by Kenneth Macmillan.\\n\\nA monument to Yesenin opened in St. Petersburg in 1995.\\n\\nIn 2005 Russian studio Pro-Cinema Production produced a TV mini-series \"Yesenin\".

It is built on the earlier BorelâWeil theorem of Armand Borel and AndrÃ© Weil, dealing just with the space of sections (the zeroth cohomology group), the extension to higher cohomology groups being provided by Raoul Bott. One can equivalently, through Serre\\'s GAGA, view this as a result in complex algebraic geometry in the Zariski topology.\\n\\nSection::::Formulation.\\nLet be a semisimple Lie group or algebraic group over formula_1, and fix a maximal torus along with a Borel subgroup which contains . Let be an integral weight of ; defines in a natural way a one-dimensional representation of , by pulling back the representation on , where is the unipotent radical of . Since we can think of the projection map as a principal -bundle, for each we get an associated fiber bundle on (note the sign), which is obviously a line bundle. Identifying with its sheaf of holomorphic sections, we consider the sheaf cohomology groups formula_2. Since acts on the total space of the bundle formula_3 by bundle automorphisms, this action naturally gives a -module structure on these groups; and the BorelâWeilâBott theorem gives an explicit description of these groups as -modules.\\n\\nWe first need to describe the Weyl group action centered at formula_4. For any integral weight and in the Weyl group , we set formula_5, where denotes the half-sum of positive roots of . It is straightforward to check that this defines a group action, although this action is \"not\" linear, unlike the usual Weyl group action. Also, a weight is said to be \"dominant\" if formula_6 for all simple roots . Let denote the length function on .\\n\\nGiven an integral weight , one of two cases occur:\\nThe theorem states that in the first case, we have\\n\\nand in the second case, we have\\n\\nIt is worth noting that case (1) above occurs if and only if formula_18 for some positive root . Also, we obtain the classical BorelâWeil theorem as a special case of this theorem by taking to be dominant and to be the identity element formula_19.\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nFor example, consider , for which is the Riemann sphere, an integral weight is specified simply by an integer , and . The line bundle is formula_20, whose sections are the homogeneous polynomials of degree (i.e. the \"binary forms\"). As a representation of , the sections can be written as , and is canonically isomorphic to . \\n\\nThis gives us at a stroke the representation theory of formula_21: formula_22 is the standard representation, and formula_23 is its th symmetric power. We even have a unified description of the action of the Lie algebra, derived from its realization as vector fields on the Riemann sphere: if , , are the standard generators of formula_21, then \\n\\nSection::::Positive characteristic.\\nOne also has a weaker form of this theorem in positive characteristic. Namely, let be a semisimple algebraic group over an algebraically closed field of characteristic formula_26. Then it remains true that formula_13 for all if is a weight such that formula_8 is non-dominant for all formula_7 as long as is \"close to zero\". This is known as the Kempf vanishing theorem. However, the other statements of the theorem do not remain valid in this setting.\\n\\nMore explicitly, let be a dominant integral weight; then it is still true that formula_13 for all formula_31, but it is no longer true that this -module is simple in general, although it does contain the unique highest weight module of highest weight as a -submodule. If is an arbitrary integral weight, it is in fact a large unsolved problem in representation theory to describe the cohomology modules formula_2 in general. Unlike over formula_33, Mumford gave an example showing that it need not be the case for a fixed that these modules are all zero except in a single degree .\\n\\nSection::::BorelâWeil theorem.\\nThe BorelâWeil theorem provides a concrete model for irreducible representations of compact Lie groups and irreducible holomorphic representations of complex semisimple Lie groups. These representations are realized in the spaces of global sections of holomorphic line bundles on the flag manifold of the group. The BorelâWeilâBott theorem is its generalization to higher cohomology spaces. The theorem dates back to the early 1950s and can be found in and .\\n\\nSection::::Statement of the theorem.\\nThe theorem can be stated either for a complex semisimple Lie group or for its compact form . Let be a connected complex semisimple Lie group, a Borel subgroup of , and the flag variety. In this scenario, is a complex manifold and a nonsingular algebraic . The flag variety can also be described as a compact homogeneous space , where is a (compact) Cartan subgroup of . An integral weight determines a holomorphic line bundle on and the group acts on its space of global sections,\\n\\nThe BorelâWeil theorem states that if is a \"dominant\" integral weight then this representation is a \"holomorphic\" irreducible highest weight representation of with highest weight . Its restriction to is an irreducible unitary representation of with highest weight , and each irreducible unitary representations of is obtained in this way for a unique value of . (A holomorphic representation of a complex Lie group is one for which the corresponding Lie algebra representation is \"complex\" linear.)\\n\\nSection::::Concrete description.\\nThe weight gives rise to a character (one-dimensional representation) of the Borel subgroup , which is denoted .

The movement was centered in Salonica. The group originated during and soon after the era of Sabbatai Zevi, a 17th-century Jewish kabbalist who claimed to be the Messiah and eventually converted to Islam under threat of death in order to escape punishment by the Sultan Mehmed IV. After Zevi\\'s conversion, a number of Jews followed him into Islam and became the DÃ¶nmeh. Since the 20th century, assimilated DÃ¶nmeh have intermarried with other groups and most have assimilated into Turkish society.\\n\\nSection::::Etymology.\\nThe Turkish word \"dÃ¶nme\" is from the verbal root \"dÃ¶n-\" that means \\'to turn\\', i.e., \"to convert\", but in a pejorative sense or \\'turncoat\\'. They are also called \"SelÃ¢nikli\" \"person from Thessaloniki\" or \"avdetÃ®\" \"religious convert\" ( \"âawdah\" \\'return\\'). Members of the group refer to themselves simply as \"the Believers\" in Hebrew ( \"ha-Ma\\'aminim\"), or \"sazanikos,\" Turkish for \"carp\" in honor of the changing outward nature of the fish. An alternate explanation of this self-nomenclature is the prophecy that Sabbatai Zevi would deliver the Jews under the sign of the fish.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nDespite their conversion to Islam, the Sabbateans secretly remained close to Judaism and continued to practice Jewish rituals covertly. They recognized Sabbatai Zevi (1626â1676) as the Jewish Messiah, observed certain commandments with similarities to those in Judaism, and prayed in Hebrew and later in Ladino. They also observed rituals celebrating important events in Zevi\\'s life and interpreted Zevi\\'s conversion in a Kabbalistic way.\\n\\nThere are several branches of the DÃ¶nmeh group. The first is the Ä°zmirli, formed in Ä°zmir (\"Smyrna\"). This was the original sect, from which two others eventually split. The first schism created the sect of the Jakubi, founded by Jacob Querido (ca. 1650â1690), the brother of Zevi\\'s last wife. Querido claimed to be Zevi\\'s reincarnation and a messiah in his own right. The second split from the Ä°zmirli was the result of claims that Berechiah Russo, known in Turkish as Osman Baba, was truly the next reincarnation of Zevi\\'s soul. These allegations gained following and gave rise to the Karakashi (Turkish), or Konioso (Ladino), branch, the most numerous and strictest branch of the DÃ¶nmeh. Missionaries from the Karakashi were active in Poland in the first part of the 18th century and taught Jacob Frank (1726â1791), the alleged heir of Russo\\'s soul. Frank went on to create the Frankist sect, another non-DÃ¶nmeh Sabbatean group in Eastern Europe. Yet another group, the Lechli, of Polish descent, lived in exile in Salonika (modern Thessaloniki, Greece) and Constantinople.\\n\\nAccording to anti-Semitic âIslamist and neo-Naziâ conspiracy theorists, several leading members of the Young Turk movement, a group of constitutional monarchist revolutionaries who brought down the Ottoman Empire, were DÃ¶nmeh. At the time of the population exchange between Greece and Turkey in 1923, some among the Salonika DÃ¶nmeh tried to be recognized as non-Muslims to avoid being forced to leave the city. After the foundation of the Turkish Republic in 1922â1923, the DÃ¶nmeh strongly supported the Republican, progressive reforms of AtatÃ¼rk that tried to restrict the power of the religious establishment and to modernize society. In particular, the DÃ¶nmeh were instrumental in establishing trade, industry, and culture in the emerging Republic of Turkey, which is partially due to the prominence of Rumeli immigrants in general, and of Salonika in particular, in the early Republic years.\\n\\nAn interesting case is the one of Ilgaz Zorlu, a DÃ¶nmeh publisher who founded \"Zvi Publishers\" in 2000 and sought recognition as a Jew, but a beth din refused to recognize his Jewishness without a full conversion. He claimed to have converted in Israel and then filed a lawsuit for changing his religion from Islam to Judaism in his registry records and identification. The court voted in his favor.\\n\\nIÅÄ±k University, which is the part of the Feyziye Schools Foundation (, FMV), and TerakkÃ® schools were founded by the DÃ¶nmeh community in Thessaloniki in the last quarter of the 19th century and continued their activities in Istanbul after Greeks captured the city on 9 November 1912.\\n\\nThere is a DÃ¶nmeh community in YenikÃ¶y, SarÄ±yer.\\n\\nThe independent scholar Rifat Bali defines the term \"dÃ¶nme\" as follows:\\n\\nSection::::Ideology.\\nThe DÃ¶nmeh ideology of the 17th century revolved primarily around the Eighteen Precepts, an abridged version of the Ten Commandments in which the admonition against adultery is explained as more of a precautionary measure than a ban, likely included to explain the antinomian sexual activities of the Sabbateans. The additional commandments are concerned with defining the kinds of interactions that may occur between the DÃ¶nmeh and the Jewish and Muslim communities. The most basic of these laws of interaction was to avoid marriage with either Jews or Muslims and to prefer relations within the sect to those outside of it. In spite of this, they maintained ties with Sabbateans who had not converted and even with Jewish rabbis, who secretly settled disputes within the DÃ¶nmeh concerning Jewish law.\\n\\nAs far as ritual was concerned, the DÃ¶nmeh followed both Jewish and Muslim traditions, shifting between one and the other as necessary for integration into Ottoman society. Outwardly Muslims and secretly Jewish Sabbateans, the DÃ¶nmeh observed traditional Muslim holidays like Ramadan but also kept the Jewish Sabbath, Brit milah and major holidays. Much of DÃ¶nmeh ritual is a combination of various elements of Kabbalah, Sabbateanism, Jewish traditional law, and Sufism.\\n\\nDÃ¶nmeh liturgy evolved as the sect grew and spread. At first, much of the DÃ¶nmeh literature was written in Hebrew. Later, as the group developed, Ladino replaced Hebrew as the prominent language and became not only the vernacular language, but also the liturgical language. Though the DÃ¶nmeh had branched into several sects, all of them held the view that Zevi was the divine messiah and that he had revealed the true \"spiritual Torah\" which was superior to the practical earthly Torah. The DÃ¶nmeh created and celebrated holidays pertaining to various points in Zevi\\'s life and their own history of conversion. Based at least partially in the Kabbalistic understanding of divinity, the DÃ¶nmeh believed that there was a three-way connection of the emanations of the divine, which engendered much conflict with Muslim and Jewish communities alike. The most notable source of opposition from other contemporary religions was the common practice of exchanging wives between members of the DÃ¶nmeh.\\n\\nThe hierarchy of the DÃ¶nmeh was based in branch divisions. The Ismirli lay at the top of the hierarchy, composed of merchant classes and intelligentsia. Artisans tended to be mostly Karakashi while lower classes were mostly Jakubi. Each branch had its own prayer community, organized into a \"Kahal,\" or congregation (Hebrew). An extensive internal economic network provided support for lower class DÃ¶nmeh in spite of ideological differences between branches.\\n\\nSection::::Anti-Semitic canards and alleged political entanglements.\\nTurkish anti-Semitism and the conspiracy theories upon which it relies are centred on the mysterious figure of the DÃ¶nmeh. According to historian Marc David Baer, the phenomenon has deep roots in late-Ottoman history, and its legacy of conspiratorial accusations persisted throughout the history of the Turkish Republic and is kept alive there today. Modern anti-Semitism racially essentializes the Jew as a ubiquitous, homogenous unit acting undercover in the guise of diverse global groups, inexorably in pursuit of global political and economic control via secretive channels. As a crypto-Sabbatean sect, the DÃ¶nmeh were always an easy target of canards about secret, âcrypto-Jewishâ political control and social influence, whether charged with setting in motion political upheaval against the status quo, or accused of shaping an oppressive regimeâs grip on the status quo.\\n\\nThe DÃ¶nmehâs history of Sabbatean theological and ritual secrecy grounded in Jewish tradition, coupled with public observance of Islam, make accusations of secret Jewish control convenient, according to Baer. âSecret Jew,â then, takes on a double meaning of being both secretly Jewish and Jews who act secretively to exert control; their secret religious identity in the first place is compatible, for conspiracy theorists, with their secretive influence, especially when they cannot be distinguished from ordinary Turkish Muslims who reside everywhere, and, as Baer argues, when the modern antisemite sees the Jew as necessarily âeverywhere.â The DÃ¶nmehâs maneuverings were said to have been at the core of Young Turk Revolution and their overthrow of the Sultan AbdÃ¼lhamid II, the dissolution of the Ottoman religious establishment, and the founding of a secular republic. Pro-Sultan, religious Muslim political opponents painted these events as a global Jewish and Freemason plot carried out by Turkeyâs secret Jews, the DÃ¶nmeh, with Mustafa Kemal AtatÃ¼rk, the chief revolutionary and former member of the Committee for Union and Progress (CUP), a leading DÃ¶nmeh himself.\\n\\nAdditionally, the crypto-Jewish conspiracy claim has been used throughout modern Turkish history by rightists and Islamists to undermine the legitimacy of incumbent political leadership, and, today, by leftists and secularists seeking to undermine the political legitimacy of Erdogan and the origins of Islamism more broadly. These, like other claims of Jewish aspirations to world-domination, embodied in part by the successes of Zionism, join the ranks as examples of both the enduring nature of such canards in contemporary Turkey, and of their deep-seated relationship with pervasive, worldwide theories of political conspiracy propagated by radically different political elements often simultaneously.\\n\\nSection::::Mehmet KarakaÅzade RÃ¼ÅtÃ¼.\\nIn 1924, Mehmet KarakaÅzade RÃ¼ÅtÃ¼, a Karakash DÃ¶nmeh, made allegations about DÃ¶nmehs, branches and wife-swapping rituals to \"Vakit\" newspaper. He also accused Donmehs of lacking patriotism and not having been assimilated. Discussions spread into other newspapers including the ones owned by DÃ¶nmeh groups. Ahmet Emin Yalman, in the newspaper (\"Vatan\") he owned, accepted the existence of such groups, but claimed that those groups were no longer following their traditions. Then KarakaÅzade RÃ¼ÅtÃ¼ petitioned the Grand National Assembly of Turkey to request the abolition of some DÃ¶nmehs\\' ongoing immigration from Macedonia by population exchange.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'DÃ¶nmeh', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7259439'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'nAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7259616', 'text': 'UFO\\'s and the Men Who Fly Them!\\n\\nUFO\\'s and the Men Who Fly Them! is a 1996 Man or Astro-man? 7\" EP released jointly by Jezz Thorpe (Drug Racer) and Henry Owings of Chunklet (magazine) on Drug Racer Records.

The patent dated 1439 is the earliest surviving such grant of arms made to a corporate body in England. The arms were modified in 1561, when the crest was added and the lion supporters granted. These grants were superseded in 1613 with minor modifications. The Queen as Freeman of the Fraternity possesses a small jewelled and enamelled brooch depicting its arms and circumscribed by the motto, known as \"The Drapers Company Badge\". She wears the brooch when performing royal engagements connected with the Drapers Company. The modern blazon is: \"Azure, three clouds radiated proper each adorned with a triple crown or\". The triple crown contains a cap (velvet/fabric lining visible through the gold structure) \"gules\".\\n\\nSection::::Original grant.\\nThe Drapers Company received its original grant of arms in 1439, from Sir William Bruges, Garter King of Arms. The \"Fraternity\" was founded under the protection of \"Blessed Mary the Virgin of the Mystery\" which is reflected in the iconography of the arms. The Garter King explained his design of the arms as follows:\\nThe original arms had supporters of two angels.\\n\\nSection::::Greenway Porch depiction (1517).\\nAn elaborate pre-Reformation relief stonework sculpture, showing the Drapers Company arms in a relevant context, survives in the \"Greenway Porch\", built in 1517 against the south wall of St Peter\\'s Church in Tiverton, Devon, by the wealthy merchant John Greenway (d.1529), a member of the Drapers Company and of the Merchant Adventurers Company. It shows Greenway (left, with monogram \"JG\" in a quatrefoil above) and his wife kneeling on either side of the Virgin Mary who is ascending into Heaven. Below the Virgin is an heraldic escutcheon showing the arms of the Drapers Company (\"Azure, three clouds radiated proper each adorned with a triple crown or\"), with the very rarely surviving pre-Reformation angel supporters, the Virgin being the patroness of the Drapers Company.\\n\\nSection::::1561 amendments.\\nIn 1561, two decades after the Reformation, the arms were inspected and confirmed by William Harvey, Clarenceux King of Arms. A new crest was granted of \"A golden ram\", and the angel supporters were replaced by \"Two lions or pelletÃ©e\".\\n\\nSection::::1613 amendments.\\nIn 1613 the Imperial crowns were modified in shape and a motto was granted, namely: \"Unto God only be Honour and Glory\". The\\nnew grant was made on 6 June 1613 by Garter King of Arms Sir William Segar, with blazon as follows:\\n\\nThe supporters are \"Two lions or pelletÃ©e\" (\"Two gold lions covered with black roundels\"). The crest is blazoned: \"On a wreath of their colours a mount vert thereon a ram jacent fleeced gold armed and unguled sable\" (\"On a braided wreath of blue and gold cord sstands a green hill on top of which lies gold ram with head raised and with black horns and hooves\"). The mantle (cloth covering the helmet) is blazoned: \"Gules, doubled argent\" (\"red lined with white\")\\n\\nSection::::Symbolism.\\nA number of explanations of the symbolism of the Drapers\\' arms have been postulated.\\nThe Company\\'s patron is the Virgin Mary, and each of the grants of arms are clear that this is to whom the triple crowns refer. Mary was deemed to be an empress and the symbol for an emperor/empress is a triple crown. However, as the Pope has long used (until 1963) the \"Papal Tiara\" or triple crown, as a symbol of his temporal and spiritual power, the symbol used in the Drapers\\' arms may have become politically tainted at the time of the Reformation when England declared independence from papal authority. This may explain the clarifications which were required in the 16th and 17th century grants.\\n\\nThe symbolism is likely to represent The Assumption of the Virgin. It has been suggested that the arms demonstrate that from Mary, through the Holy Spirit, comes the divine Son of God: thus the sunbeams represent the brilliance and light of the Virgin Mary, and the cloud which is a frequent symbol for the Holy Spirit. Another suggestion is that the crowned clouds are mistaken renderings of pyx-canopies, that is veils (as would be sold by drapers) hanging from pyxes.\\n\\nThe triple repetition of this main charge follows standard heraldic usage for charges of all kinds, but here also serves to emphasise the Trinity.\\n\\nSection::::Motto.\\nThe motto is: \"Unto God only be Honour and Glory\".\\n\\n', 'title': 'Coat of arms of the Drapers Company', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=727584'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'pwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7275936', 'text': \"Western station (CTA Blue Line O'Hare branch)\\n\\nWestern is a station on the Chicago Transit Authority's 'L' system, serving the Blue Line, on North Western Avenue near West Armitage Avenue.

Ekinci demanded to go to Rome to speak with the Pope, but Greek and Italian F-16 Fighting Falcon jets intercepted and escorted the aircraft until it landed in Brindisi, Italy. Nobody was harmed, and Ekinci was jailed in Italy while awaiting trial. At first, the hijacking incident was linked with the envisaged visit of Pope Benedict XVI to Turkey, but later it was ascertained that Ekinci was seeking to request political asylum from Italy. On October 4, a Turkish Airlines plane was sent to take the other passengers to Istanbul.\\n\\nSection::::Hijacking.\\nOn October 3, 2006, the Boeing 737-4Y0 took off from Tirana bound for Istanbul. It was hijacked by Hakan Ekinci in Greek airspace at 14:58 UTC and was intercepted and forced by Italian F-16 Fighting Falcon interceptor jets to land at the southern Italian Adriatic port city of Brindisi. There were 113 people on board: 107 passengers and six crew members. At first it was reported that there were two hijackers, but later it was confirmed that the sole hijacker lied about the existence of an accomplice.\\n\\nAn official from Greek Ministry of National Defence said the plane had entered Greek air space at 14:58 (UTC). The pilots transmitted the hijack squawk code twice at 14:55 (UTC), while the aircraft was cruising about 25\\xa0kilometres (15\\xa0mi) north of Thessaloniki. Italian Interior Minister Giuliano Amato reported that the hijacker slipped into the cockpit with a package which could have been a bomb when flight attendants opened the cockpit door, and the pilots acted according to the international rules in the matter and did what the hijacker wanted. The flight\\'s captain reported in Istanbul that \"while the chief stewardess entered the cockpit to ask if we needed anything, the terrorist entered by force. I tried to push him out but he was a big man and I failed to stop him\". The captain went on to say that the hijacker said he had three friends and they had explosives. He wanted to go Rome to speak with the Pope, and Italian Minister of the Interior Giuliano Amato reported that, the hijacker added there are other hijackers on another unspecified plane, \"would blow that plane up if the missive didn\\'t get to the pope\". The captain reported to the air-traffic controller in Thessaloniki that \"he had two undesirables who wished to go to Italy to see the Pope and to give him a message\". Four Greek F-16 fighter jets took off and accompanied the plane until it left Greek airspace. Once in Italian airspace, two Italian F-16s intercepted, escorted, and forced it to land in Brindisi Airport in Brindisi. The airline spokesman said that Greek officials had alerted their Italian counterparts about the hijacking incident.\\n\\nSection::::Passenger accounts.\\nPassengers said that the hijacker used no violence. Sabri Abazi, an Albanian member of parliament, who was a passenger on the flight, spoke to ANSA news agency by mobile phone on board. Abazi said that there was one hijacker in the cockpit and another in the cabin, and added that he saw no weapons. Passenger ErgÃ¼n ErkÃ¶seoÄlu said \"I didn\\'t see any suspicious behaviour of the hijacker. Airplane took off and after 20 minutes later, captain announced that due to technical malfunction we would land in Italy instead of Istanbul\". Aviation authorities said that after all the passengers had left the plane, police questioned the hijacker. Abazi said that he saw only one hijacker but had been told by a flight attendant that there were two hijackers on board. Istanbul Governor Muammer GÃ¼ler reported that the hijacker Ekinci lied to the airliner\\'s pilots that he had at least one accomplice.\\n\\nSection::::Upon landing.\\nItalian police, military, and fire brigade vehicles surrounded the plane and the Italian news agency ANSA reported that police detained both hijackers. Brindisi Police Chief, Salvatore De Paolis, told Reuters \"they will request political asylum\". In an interview with reporters, a fire rescue official said \"The two hijackers want to speak to journalists so they can send a message to the Pope and explain why they did this.\" Amoto reported that the hijacker wanted to deliver a message for Pope Benedict XVI, but stated he did not have a written letter.\\n\\nHijacker Hakan Ekinci\\'s protest took six hours, and after his surrender the hijacker apologized to the captain and shook his hand; he also apologized to the passengers. CNN TÃ¼rk reported that there were 107 passengers, 80 of them Albanian and five Turkish.\\n\\nAfter the incident a Tirana airport video was released to Reuters showing Ekinci being checked by security. He was body searched and passed through a metal detector, then removed his belt, sweater, and emptied his pockets, but was cleared to proceed to his flight.\\n\\nEkinci was arrested in Italy after interrogation. Turkish Minister of Justice Cemil ÃiÃ§ek reported that there would not be a direct return request to the Italian Ministry of Justice until the Chief Public Prosecutor\\'s Office and Ministry of Internal Affairs had completed their work on the subject. They then requested the return of Ekinci. Giuseppe Giannuzzi, prosecutor of the hijacking incident, said to The Associated Press in an interview that the hijacker will remain in jail until the end of the trial which will presumably take two years after inception. Giannuzzi has charged Ekinci with hijacking and considered other charges like terrorism and kidnapping, if Ekinci is sentenced for hijacking he will be imprisoned for 7 to 21 years.\\n\\nSection::::Possible motives.\\nSeveral theories have emerged as to the motives for the hijacking. At first Turkish media reported police sources as saying the hijacking was in protest at the envisaged visit of Pope Benedict XVI, who has offended many Muslims with a recent speech linking the spread of the Islamic faith to violence. But later it was reported that the hijacker sought political asylum in Italy due to his conscientious objection to serving in the military.\\n\\nAt first, Turkish media reported that there were two hijackers, Hakan Ekinci and Mehmet ErtaÅ, but later it was ascertained that Ekinci was alone and ErtaÅ was innocent. According to the report of Turkey\\'s Ministry of Justice, first information about hijacking incident were retrieved via Interpol and authorities reported ErtaÅ\\'s name as hijacker based on Interpol\\'s report but after more investigations it was ascertained that ErtaÅ was innocent.\\n\\nTurkish officials reported the hijacker\\'s name as Hakan Ekinci, born in 1978 in Buca, who is known to have written a letter to the Pope in August 2006. He wrote, \"I am a Christian and don\\'t want to serve a Muslim army\". He also wrote that he had been attending church since 1998. Istanbul Governor Muammer GÃ¼ler reported that, Ekinci, who has been identified as a Christian convert by the Turkish media and by chief prosecutor Giuseppe Giannuzzi\\'s reporting near Lecce, is a conscientious objector Catholic and has dodged his military conscription. He left Istanbul on May 6, 2006 and had gone to Albania. Turkey\\'s Consulate General in Tirana then filed for his deportation. If he had landed in Turkey, Hakan Ekinci was certain to be interned as a draft-dodger, since the Consulate had reported the order for his deportation to the police at AtatÃ¼rk International Airport. Authorities had been investigating him since September 1 on the draft-dodging charge.\\n\\nPope Benedict XVI visited Ankara, Istanbul, and Ephesus as a guest of the Turkish President Ahmet Necdet Sezer between November 28 and December 1, 2006. Vatican City officials reported that the Pope was informed of the hijacking incident but the preparations for his trip would not be affected.\\n\\nSection::::Passengersâ compensation flight.\\nAlthough the hijacker was found to have acted alone, Italian police took statements from passengers and searched the aircraft and baggage for a possible accomplice, and due to this process, passengers stayed in Italy during the night. On October 4, a Turkish Airlines Boeing 737, was sent from Turkey to bring the passengers back to Istanbul. The plane departed from Brindisi Airport at 4:15 (UTC) and landed in Istanbul at 5:40 (UTC) with 105 passengers, with the exception of the hijacker who had been arrested in Brindisi, and a passenger who wanted to remain in Italy.\\n', 'title': 'Turkish Airlines Flight 1476', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7276105'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '727753', 'text': 'Franz Vranitzky\\n\\nFranz Vranitzky (born 4 October 1937) is an Austrian politician.

He attended the Realgymnasium Geblergasse and studied economics, graduating in 1960. He financed his studies teaching Latin and English and as a construction worker.\\n\\nAs a young man, Vranitzky played basketball and was a member of Austria\\'s national team, which in 1960 unsuccessfully tried to qualify for the 1960 Summer Olympics in Rome.\\n\\nIn 1962 he joined the Social Democratic Party of Austria (SPÃ).\\n\\nIn 1962, Vranitzky married Christine Christen, with whom he fathered two children.\\n\\nVranitzky began his career in 1961 at Siemens-Schuckert, but within the year switched to the Oesterreichische Nationalbank, Austriaâs central bank. In 1969, he received a doctorate in International business studies. The following year, Hannes Androsch, minister of finance under Chancellor Bruno Kreisky, appointed him economic and financial advisor. Vranitzky served as deputy director of the Creditanstalt-Bankverein (1976â1981), briefly as its director general and as director general of the Ãsterreichische LÃ¤nderbank (1981â1984).\\n\\nIn 1984, Vranitzky joined the SPÃ-Freedom Party (FPÃ) government coalition under Chancellor Fred Sinowatz as minister of finance. He was criticized for receiving multiple compensations from his various functions in government-run businesses.\\n\\nSection::::Chancellor of Austria.\\nIn the presidential elections of 1986, Chancellor Sinowatz vociferously opposed Kurt Waldheim, the candidate of the Austrian People\\'s Party (ÃVP) opposition. The former UN Secretary General\\'s campaign for office caused international controversy due to allegations about his role as a German army officer in World War II. When Waldheim was elected on 8 June, Sinowatz resigned from the government, proposing Vranitzky as his successor.\\n\\nVranitzky entered his new office on 16 June 1986. At first he continued the government coalition with the Freedom Party. On 13 September 1986, however, radical FPÃ politician JÃ¶rg Haider was elected chairman of his party, ousting the moderate Vice Chancellor Norbert Steger. Vranitzky ended cooperation with his coalition partner and had parliament dissolved.\\n\\nIn the subsequent elections on 23 November 1986, the SPÃ remained the strongest party. In January 1987, Vranitzky formed a government, based on a \"grand coalition\" with the second-largest party, the Christian democrat ÃVP, with Alois Mock serving as vice-chancellor and foreign minister. In 1988, Vranitzky also succeeded Fred Sinowatz as chairman of his party.\\n\\nUntil 1992, Austria\\'s foreign policy had to deal with the repercussions of the Waldheim controversy, as the Austrian president was shunned in some diplomatic circles. The United States regarded Waldheim as a persona non grata, thereby barring him from entering the country in 1987, while Israel had recalled its ambassador after Waldheim\\'s election. Vranitzky managed to normalise Austria\\'s relations with both countries and frequently stepped in to perform diplomatic duties commonly assigned to the president.\\n\\nOn 8 July 1991, in a speech in parliament, Vranitzky acknowledged a share in the responsibility for the pain brought, not by Austria as a state, but by citizens of this country, upon other people and peoples\", thereby departing from the hitherto official portrayal of Austria as \"Hitler\\'s first victim.\"\\n\\nAfter the end of the Cold War, Vranitzky focused on furthering relations with the nations of Eastern Europe and membership in the European Union, of which Vranitzky and his foreign minister, Alois Mock, were strong advocates. After a referendum on 12 June 1994 resulted in 66% in favour of EU membership, Austria joined the European Union in January 1995. Austria\\'s military neutrality, which had been espoused during the Cold War, was reaffirmed in the process.\\n\\nIn party politics, Vranitzky kept his distance from JÃ¶rg Haider\\'s Freedom Party - a stance the latter decried as a \"policy of exclusion.\" In the election of 1990, Vranitzky\\'s coalition government was confirmed when the Social Democrat vote remained stable while the ÃVP lost 17 seats, mainly to the FPÃ. The 1994 election saw heavy losses by both coalition parties, which nonetheless remained the two largest parties, while FPÃ and others made further gains. Vranitzky renewed the coalition with the ÃVP, which after May 1995 was led by foreign minister Wolfgang SchÃ¼ssel. Later in the year, the grand coalition broke apart over budget policy, leading to the elections of December 1995, which however only saw slight changes in favor of SPÃ and ÃVP. Vranitzky and SchÃ¼ssel resumed their coalition in March 1996.\\n\\nIn January 1997, Vranitzky resigned as Chancellor and as party chairman. He was succeeded in both positions by his minister of finance, Viktor Klima.\\n\\nSection::::Later activities.\\nAfter leaving office, Vranitzky served as Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe representative for Albania from March to October 1997, before returning into the banking sector, as political consultant to the WestLB bank. In December, he was elected to the board of governors of automotive supplier Magna. He later occupied the same position for the tourism company TUI and Magic Life hotels.\\n\\nIn June 2005, he donated one of his kidneys to his wife Christine, who suffered from chronic kidney failure.\\n\\nHe actively supported his party\\'s frontrunner Alfred Gusenbauer in the 2006 elections. During the campaign it was revealed, that in 1999, Vranitzky had received a million Austrian schillings as a consultant to the BAWAG bank, which was then under public scrutiny. It was alleged that the payment was made without any service in return and that it constituted an \"indirect party funding\". Vranitzky denounced the allegations.\\n\\nVranitzky chairs the quarterly \"Vranitzky colloquia\", organised by the study group WiWiPol, which discusses economic topics and their impact on Austria and Europe.

He entered the Spanish army at age 17 and was sent to Italy as an ensign of grenadiers of the Royal Guard. In 1750 he transferred to the Walloon Guards, bodyguards of the Bourbon kings of Spain. In 1756 he was promoted to lieutenant and was made a knight in the Teutonic Order. He became a colonel (still in the Walloon Guards) in 1760.\\n\\nIn 1766 he came to New Spain as a captain in the guard of Viceroy Carlos Francisco de Croix, marquÃ©s de Croix. He subsequently served as commandant of the fortress in Acapulco and as inspector of all troops in the viceroyalty. He served in this capacity until 1770. In 1771 the term of Viceroy Croix ended, and both Francisco and Teodoro returned to Spain. \"Visitador\" JosÃ© de GÃ¡lvez returned with them.\\n\\nSection::::Provincias Internas del Norte.\\nThe Commandancy General of the Provincias Internas del Norte (\"Commandancy General of the Internal Provinces of the North\") was established in New Spain in 1776, incorporating Nueva Vizcay, Santa Fe de Nuevo MÃ©xico, Nuevo LeÃ³n, Coahuila, Sonora y Sinaloa, Las Californias, and Spanish Texas. This arrangement was a response to numerous attacks by Apaches, Seris, Comanches, and other Indigenous tribes and to the fear of encroachment by other European powers. Headquarters was to be at Arizpe, Sonora.\\n\\nOn May 16, 1776, King Charles III of Spain named Brigadier Teodoro de Croix the first commandant general of the new jurisdiction. He replaced Hugo OconÃ³r, an appointee of New Spain Viceroy Antonio MarÃ­a de Bucareli y UrsÃºa, in charge of Spanish forces on the northern frontier. He was independent of the viceroy of New Spain in most of this territory, but in Alta California the two were to share jurisdiction.\\n\\nCroix assumed his office on January 1, 1777. He left Mexico City to inspect his new jurisdiction in August. He was responsible for military defense, civilian colonization and conversion of the Indians over the large, sparsely inhabited territory. Croix reported directly to the minister of the Indies, JosÃ© de GÃ¡lvez.\\n\\nHe built up the strongest military force across the northern frontier from Texas to Sonora than had ever been seen in the area, revamping the whole border defense in the process. On October 24, 1781, the king approved the separation of the Californias as a jurisdiction at the level of the Provincias Internas de Occidente.\\n\\nSection::::Viceroy of Peru.\\nCroix was appointed lieutenant general and named viceroy of Peru on February 13, 1783. He relinquished command in the Provincias Internas del Norte to Felipe de Neve.\\n\\nAs viceroy of Peru, he decentralized the government through the creation of seven \"intendencias\".

The word is rarely used of oneself, but rather is applied descriptively to the behavior of other people. The person who is carrying out \"amae\" may beg or plead, or alternatively act selfishly while secure in the knowledge that the caregiver will indulge them. The behavior of children towards their parents is perhaps the most common example of \"amae\", but Doi argued that child-rearing practices in the Western world seek to stop this kind of dependence, whereas in Japan it persists into adulthood in all kinds of social relationships.\\n\\nSection::::In literary context.\\nDoi developed this idea to explain and describe many kinds of Japanese behavior. However, Doi states that while \"amae\" is not just a Japanese phenomenon, the Japanese are the only people known to have an extensive vocabulary for describing it. The reason for this is that \"amae\" is a major factor in Japanese interaction and customs. Doi argues that nonverbal empathic guesswork (\"sasshi\" ), a fondness for unanimous agreement in decision-making, the ambiguity and hesitation of self-expression (\"enryo\" ), and the \"tatemaeâhonne\" dynamics are communicative manifestations of the \"amae\" psychology of Japanese people.\\nDoi translates \"amaeru\" as \"to depend and presume upon another\\'s benevolence\". It indicates, for Doi, \"helplessness and the desire to be loved\". \"Amaeru\" can also be defined as \"to wish to be loved\", and denotes dependency needs. \"Amae\" is, in essence, a request for indulgence of one\\'s perceived needs.\\n\\nDoi says,\\nAccording to Doi and others, in Japan the kind of relationship based on this prototype provides a model of human relationships in general, especially (though not exclusively) when one person is senior to another. As another writer puts it:\\n\"Amae\" may also be used to describe the behavior of a husband who comes home drunk and depends on his wife to get him ready for bed. In Japan, \"amae\" does have a connotation of immaturity, but it is also recognized as a key ingredient in loving relationships, perhaps more so than the notions of romance so common in the West.\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nDoi\\'s work has been heavily criticized by academics specializing in nihonjinron studies as being anecdotal and full of inaccuracies. (See Dale, P. 1986 The Myth of Japanese Uniqueness, Mouer and Sugimoto 1986, 1982, Kubota 1999)\\n\\nDoi\\'s work has been hailed as a distinctive contribution to psychoanalysis by the American psychiatrist Frank Johnson, who has devoted a full book-length study to Doi and to his critics.\\n\\nSection::::Publication history.\\nIt was originally published in Japanese in 1971, and an English translation by John Bester was later published in 1973.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'The Anatomy of Dependence', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7282253'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7282479', 'text': 'AOL OpenRide\\n\\nAOL OpenRide was an Internet application suite made by AOL that combined e-mail, instant-messaging, a web browser and a media player in one window.

He tied for first in the 1973-74 Junior Canadian Chess Championship, but lost the playoff match to John MacPhail. One of his key early tournament victories came in the 1974 Montreal Championship, where he scored 5Â½/6. He had reached national master strength by this time, just before his twentieth birthday. He attended McGill University, studying engineering, and was an excellent student; however, he left McGill before completing his degree, in favour of becoming a chess professional. Spraggett spent his early years developing his game in minor Canadian and American Swiss system open events, where the prizes were often low. His younger brother Grant is also a strong player, having earned the FIDE Master (FM) title.\\n\\nHe was awarded the IM title in 1975, following a second-place finish at the Zonal Canadian Chess Championship in Calgary; Peter Biyiasas won. Spraggett raised his game to meet the challenge of the powerful Soviet defector Igor V. Ivanov, who had settled in Montreal in the early 1980s. Those years saw Spraggett attain success in several strong tournaments, with victories in the 1983 World Open, 1984 Commonwealth Championship, 1984 New York Open, and 1985 Commonwealth Championship. He did not play an international-standard grandmaster round-robin tournament until Wijk aan Zee early in 1985, just after his thirtieth birthday, at which time he was the highest-rated IM in the world.\\n\\nSpraggett won his first of seven Canadian titles in 1984, which qualified him into the Taxco Interzonal the next year. His fourth-place result at Taxco 1985, where he topped many more famous players, automatically earned the International Grandmaster title, and seeded him to the Candidates event, the first Canadian to achieve this. He came in last at Montpellier Candidates 1985, but qualified again for the next Candidates. In his first-round match at Saint John, 1988, Spraggett defeated world #3 Andrei Sokolov in a blitz playoff. He then lost in extra games in the 1989 Candidates' quarterfinal round to Soviet Grand Master Artur Yusupov at Quebec City.\\n\\nSpraggett has followed up with mostly superb performances in eight Chess Olympiads, eight victories in the Canadian Open Championship, and a host of tournament victories in Europe. Spraggett is widely considered to be the strongest chess player in Canadian history. His FIDE rating peaked at 2633, in January 2007, at age 52, and in the late 1980s he was ranked consistently amongst the top 100 players in the world. Spraggett has lived in Portugal since the late 1980s, and plays most of his tournaments in Europe, although he visits North America every year or two on average, to compete there. His best recent finishes include a victory at the Figueira da Foz International Chess Festival (December 2008, with 7Â½/9) and a clear second place at the CalviÃ  Open (in October 2007, with 7/9).\\n\\n\\nSection::::Playing style.\\nSpraggett is a solid positional player, who has the capability of developing sharp tactics against any opponent, but generally these tactics flow naturally and harmoniously from the position, instead of being overly forced. During his career, he has essayed a very wide range of openings, from sharp Sicilian Defences with either color, to complex King's Indian and Dutch Defences, to quieter lines such as the Caro-Kann and Queen's Indian Defences, and more subtle RÃ©ti and English Openings as White. This extensive range makes him very difficult to prepare for. Spraggett is also a strong endgame player. A true universalist of the chessboard, his style perhaps most closely resembles that of former World Champion Vasily Smyslov.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Kevin Spraggett', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7286821'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7286851', 'text': 'Nearctic (horse)\\n\\nNearctic (February 11, 1954 â 27 July 1973) was a Canadian-bred Hall of Fame Thoroughbred racehorse. \\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nBred by E.

He pitched in Major League Baseball for ten seasons between 1886 and 1896. In several seasons, Chamberlain finished in his league\\'s top ten in a number of pitching categories, including wins, earned run average, strikeouts, and shutouts. During one of his best seasons, the 1888 St. Louis Browns won the American Association pennant with a 92â43 record. Although a righthanded pitcher, Chamberlain pitched the last two innings of an 1888 game with his left hand.\\n\\nChamberlain finished his major league career with 264 complete games out of his 301 games started. After his playing days, he was hired as a baseball umpire and later announced that he was becoming a boxer, but neither venture seems to have worked out. Not much is known about Chamberlain\\'s later life. He died in Baltimore in 1929.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nChamberlain was born on November 5, 1867 in Warsaw, New York. He was one of six children born to veterinary surgeon Irving Chamberlain and his wife Carrie. Moving to Buffalo as a child, Chamberlain began to play organized baseball as a teenager. His early professional career included stints in Hamilton, Ontario and with a Southern League team in Macon, Georgia. As a 17-year-old pitcher with Hamilton, he earned 18 wins and led the league in strikeouts.\\n\\nChamberlain made his major league debut with the Louisville Colonels of the American Association on September 13, 1886. In early October, Chamberlain was pitching in a game against the Baltimore Orioles when Louisville players began to complain that opposing pitcher Matt Kilroy was leaving the pitcher\\'s box when he threw the ball. When the umpire did not respond to Louisville\\'s complaints, Chamberlain\\'s manager told him to run forward out of the box when he let go of his pitches. The move \"scared the Baltimore batters out of their wits\" and Kilroy did not deliver any more questionable pitches.\\n\\nIn 1887, Chamberlain won 18 games for Louisville. The right-hander, who stood and weighed 168\\xa0lbs., earned the nickname \"Ice Box\". Some sources attribute the nickname to his ability to remain cool when facing tough opposition, but at least one source links the nickname to chronic laziness. On May 9, 1888, while pitching against the Kansas City Cowboys, Chamberlain pitched righthanded for the first seven innings and lefthanded for the last two innings. Louisville won the game by a score of 18â6. He was the third major league pitcher to throw with both his left and right hands during the same game. The feat was not repeated in the major leagues until Greg Harris switched arms for the ninth inning of a 1995 game.\\n\\nChamberlain was traded to the St. Louis Browns in August 1888, having already registered 14 wins for the Colonels that year. He earned 11 more wins in the last six weeks of the season. He struck out 176 batters and registered a 2.19 earned run average that season, good for fifth among the league\\'s pitchers. The Browns finished 1888 with a fourth consecutive league pennant. However, not long after Chamberlain joined the club, pitcher Nat Hudson left the team to get married. In the World Series, the Browns had only Chamberlain and pitcher Silver King to face a trio of New York Giants pitchers that included future Hall of Famer Tim Keefe.\\n\\nAfter Chamberlain pitched a shutout in the second game of the 1888 World Series, he lost the fourth, sixth and eighth games. Chamberlain gave up 11 runs in the eighth game. Though the Giants clinched the series after that game, they played a full ten games, with Chamberlain winning the last game. The series was Chamberlain\\'s last major league postseason playing appearance.\\n\\nSection::::Middle career.\\nThe Cincinnati Reds talked to St. Louis about acquiring Chamberlain in 1889, but Cincinnati balked when St. Louis asked $8,000 for him. That year, Chamberlain pitched in a career-high 53 games and finished with 32 wins; his win total was the third highest in the league. Following the 1889 season, a new major league was forming known as the Players\\' League. A players association known as the Brotherhood of Professional Ball Players had served as a union and bargaining agent since the mid-1880s; now the group\\'s new league was attempting to compete with established baseball. Browns owner Chris von der Ahe was afraid that Chamberlain would jump to the Chicago team in the new league; the manager of the Browns from the previous season, Charles Comiskey, had been hired there. Von der Ahe agreed to match the $800 pay increase that Chamberlain would have gotten in Chicago.\\n\\nChamberlain had returned to Buffalo by May 1890, where he was reported to be hanging out in pool rooms. Rumors held that Chamberlain wanted to join the Brotherhood and that he was \"playing for his release.\" He was sold to the Columbus Solons (also of the American Association) the next month. Chamberlain had appeared in five games for St. Louis and pitched in 25 more for Columbus by the end of the season. He finished the year with a league-leading six shutouts. In February 1891, Chamberlain pleaded guilty to a charge of aiding and abetting a prize fight. He received a $50 fine and the Columbus team declared that they would not retain him for the 1891 season.\\n\\nThe Philadelphia Athletics indicated immediate interest in Chamberlain, hoping that he would pitch most of the team\\'s games. Chamberlain earned a 22â23 win-loss record in 1891. He was the losing pitcher in the last of 485 shutouts recorded in the few seasons of American Association play. In August, he gave up the longest home run that had been hit at Boston\\'s Congress Street Grounds. Chamberlain pitched for the NL\\'s Cincinnati Reds in 1892, compiling a 19â23 record. In May of that season, Chamberlain pitched in an unusual game that was suspended due to sunlight; the scoreless game was in extra innings when umpire Jack Sheridan ruled that the sun was too bright for players to see the ball. The 1892 Reds finished with an overall record of 82â68. League officials split the season into two halves and the Reds finished fourth and eighth in the respective halves.\\n\\nBefore the 1893 season, Chamberlain indicated his displeasure with the climate in Cincinnati and said that he hoped to pitch for New York or Philadelphia in the coming year. He also said that he would be happy to pitch in Buffalo if the city received a major league expansion team. Chamberlain stayed in Cincinnati for that season and the next one, earning 16â12 and 10â9 records. On May 30, 1894, Chamberlain was the pitcher when Bobby Lowe became the first major league player to hit four home runs in one game. Two of Lowe\\'s home runs came in the same inning. Lowe hit only 70 career home runs in an 18-year career.\\n\\nSection::::Later career and life.\\nChamberlain had agreed to play for the Cleveland Spiders in 1895, but instead he joined a Class D baseball team out of Warren, Ohio in the Iron and Oil League. Future Baseball Hall of Fame member Honus Wagner played on the team. Years later, Wagner recalled Chamberlain as an experienced pitcher who shared his baseball knowledge with his young teammates. He reported to the Spiders in 1896. The team featured Cy Young and young pitchers such as Cy Swaim and Zeke Wilson. Chamberlain was released after appearing in two games.\\n\\nChamberlain finished his major league career with a 157â120 win-loss record and a 3.57 earned run average. Though he only finished among the top ten in complete games in two of his seasons, Chamberlain completed 264 of his 301 games started. His complete game total was ranked 64th on the all-time major league list after the 2013 season. Chamberlain also hit nine home runs, including a grand slam, during his major league career.\\n\\nIn early 1898, \"The Montreal Gazette\" reported that NL president Nicholas Young signed Chamberlain as an umpire for the coming season. Chamberlain did not ultimately work for the NL because he was unhappy with the salary that he was offered. He played local semi-amateur baseball in Buffalo and then announced that he was leaving baseball to become a boxer. He challenged Jack Baty, a black fighter, to a boxing match and posted a $500 bet on the fight. There is no record of Chamberlain boxing against Baty or anyone else, and little is known about his life after the major leagues.\\n\\nChamberlain briefly played minor league baseball for the 1899 Buffalo Bisons in the Western League. He did not win any games for Buffalo. In 1904, \"Sporting Life\" reported that the pitcher had a brother, F. Earl Chamberlain, who was named a Pacific Coast League umpire. Elton died of colon cancer at the age of 61. He was interred in the Holy Cross Cemetery in Baltimore, Maryland.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Ice Box Chamberlain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7289138'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'tAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7290518', 'text': \"Old Tampa Children's Home\\n\\nThe Old Tampa Children's Home (also known as the Good Samaritan Inn) is a historic home in Tampa, Florida.

When his parents died, leaving him orphaned at the age of 12, Sherman moved to Boston, where he began working as a clerk in Boston mercantile houses four years later.\\n\\nHe soon moved to New York City, and in 1831, resettled in Newport, Kentucky, where he engaged in the manufacture of cotton bagging. On April 27, 1835, Sherman married Catharine Isabel Cox (1815â1865) of Frankfort, Kentucky with whom he eventually had 8 children. Sherman\\'s business prospered and he became well known and influential in the community.\\n\\nSection::::Texas Revolution and the Republic of Texas.\\nIn November 1835, a public meeting was held in neighboring Cincinnati to encourage support for Texas in her struggle against the Mexican government. A number of Cincinnatians and Northern Kentuckians pledged funding for ammunition and weapons (including the two artillery pieces later famous as the \"Twin Sisters\" of the Battle of San Jacinto). They left via riverboat to start their journey for Texas on January 6, 1836, with Sherman serving as captain of the company, which called itself the \"Kentucky Rifles.\" Local citizens helped fund uniforms and donated a flag.\\n\\nSherman arrived in Texas in late January, and joined the main Texian Army or Texas Army gathering near Gonzales on February 3. On March 12, many of the new volunteers for the army joined with Sam Houston and were organized into one regiment, with Edward Burleson elected colonel and Sherman his lieutuenant. With volunteers still streaming into Texas, enough men were recruited to fill out a second regiment. On April 8, the army was reorganized and the Second Regiment formed with Sherman as its colonel, though his old company remained in the First Regiment. Sherman led his troops at the Battle of San Jacinto, and they are weâre generally credited as first uttering the famous warcry, \"Remember the Alamo! Remember Goliad!\"\\n\\nIn August, Sherman became colonel of the cavalry of the new Republic of Texas and returned home to Kentucky to recruit more men for the Texan army. For his services in the revolution, he was granted large tracts of land as a token of gratitude by the legislature. When he returned to Texas in December, he brought his wife and her young 11-year-old brother back with him, settling near San Jacinto Bay and constructing a small home. Other family members soon settled nearby, although yellow fever killed Sherman\\'s brother Dana and his sister-in-law. Sherman served in the cavalry commander\\'s role until mid-December 1837.\\n\\nSherman was a member of the Texas House of Representatives, from Harris County, during the Seventh Congress, November 4, 1842, to January 17, 1843. He introduced a bill providing for the election of a Major General of Militia for the protection of the frontier, which was passed over the veto of President Sam Houston. Thomas J. Rusk briefly assumed the position, with Sherman as his successor in mid-1843.\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nIn 1846, General Sherman purchased 4,000 acres (16\\xa0kmÂ²) of land near Harrisburg and began promoting the Buffalo Bayou, Brazos, and Colorado Railway (later part of the Southern Pacific system). He constructed a mansion in 1847, as well as a nearby sawmill. However, both were lost in separate fires within a decade. Without insurance and having lost most of his fortune, he moved to Galveston and opened a hotel.\\n\\nDuring the American Civil War, Sherman was requested by the local Committee of Safety of the union to take full charge of affairs at Galveston, with full authority to put the island in a state of defense. In 1862 he moved with his family to his old home on the San Jacinto Bay and with them went former Republic of Texas President David G. Burnet.

Stackpole, Scott Bennie, Mark O\\'Green, and Liz Danforth. The canceled 1997 game \"\" notwithstanding, this game marks the last time DeForest Kelley played the role of Leonard McCoy.

The magazine concluded that although experienced adventurers would finish the game quickly, \"it would be a shame for Star Trek fanatics to miss out on \"Judgment Rites\"\". Charles Ardai said in April 1994 that \"Judgment Rites\" \"is a better game in any number of ways\" than its predecessor, with optional and less combat, more and larger episodes, a unified plot thread, and bigger roles for supporting characters.\\n\\n\"Judgment Rites\" was a runner-up for \"Computer Gaming World\"s 1993 \"Adventure Game of the Year\" award, which ultimately went to \"\" and \"Day of the Tentacle\" (tie).

Any proceeds in addition to expenses go to fostering new programs, support services or community welfare programs. They also do not sell air time â programs are broadcast at no cost. The provision of finance is not a consideration in determining which programs will go to air on the channel. Programs are selected on merit and their potential placement within the schedule.\\n\\nSection::::Vision.\\nSection::::Faith.\\nThe foundation stones of ACCTV are VISION and FAITH. The vision for ACCTV is to see the Good News message of Christ broadcast through the Australian media platforms. The journey of faith began in 1987 when a vision was birthed to see a Christian-based television channel established in Australia. What began as an impossible dream became a reality on Easter Sunday 1999, when ACCTV commenced a 24-hour broadcast on Optus Television. From humble beginnings ACCTV has grown steadily and is now available on most subscription television services in Australia.\\n\\nâFaith is taking the first step even when you donât see the whole staircase.â Martin Luther King Jr.\\n\\nFaith is also like a muscle that requires stress and pressure to make it strong. This analogy relates to the development of ACCTV. By God\\'s Grace and providence we will continue to build on the foundation that has been laid and establish a Christian media platform that is a World leader in the area of faith- based broadcasting.\\n\\nSection::::Hope.\\nIn a world where there is a desperate need for hope and encouragement, ACCTV is intentional in its efforts to provide a platform where people are encouraged, enriched and inspired with a sense of Hope. Hope is more than just a matter of turning on the TV, it\\'s connecting with the message of hope and discovering a life of meaning and purpose, based on the âHope of the Worldâ â the person of Jesus. âNow faith is confidence in what we hope for and assurance about what we do not see.â There is a distinct link between faith and hope and in faith we hold onto the hope and believe that one day every home in Australia will have access to ACCTV. âHope never fails.â\\n\\nSection::::Love.\\nâLove always protects, love always hopes, love always trusts, love always perseveres.â Love is our motivation. It\\'s at the core of everything we do. Our love for God compels us to work with integrity and excellence. The outworking of this love is to see ACCTV become the very best it can possibly be. We are passionate about sourcing the best programs to inspire, encourage and offer hope to our viewers. âWe Love Good TVâ has become our standard. It\\'s what we stand for and what we aspire to and we believe the best way to do that is through the power of story. We are intentional in broadcasting life-changing stories, that inspire, encourage, build-up and declare the Love of God to all. The greatest story of all, is a Love story, it\\'s all about Jesus.\\n\\nSection::::Content.\\nThe Australian Christian Channel sources programming from all over the world and Australia, with a goal to continue to increase the amount of quality local Aussie content on air.

Named in honor of Union General Israel B. Richardson, who died in the Battle of Antietam during the American Civil War, it was active from 1867 to 1878. Today, the site, with a few surviving buildings, is called Fort Richardson State Park, Historic Site and Lost Creek Reservoir State Trailway. It was designated a National Historic Landmark in 1963 for its role in securing the state\\'s northern frontier in the post-Civil War era.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nAs much as any frontier army installation, Fort Richardson facilitated white immigration and settlement in north-central Texas. It was part of a system of forts along the Texas frontier to protect and encourage settlement in north-central and West Texas. Others included Forts Griffin, Concho, Belknap, Chadbourne, Stockton, Davis, McKavett, Clark, McIntosh, Inge, and Phantom Hill in Texas, and Fort Sill in Oklahoma. Some \"subposts or intermediate stations\" include Bothwick\\'s Station on Salt Creek between Fort Richardson and Fort Belknap, Camp Wichita near Buffalo Springs between Fort Richardson and Red River Station, and Mountain Pass between Fort Concho and Fort Griffin.\\n\\nThe original site selection was ordered for a location near Buffalo Springs in Clay County about north of Fort Richardson. The location proved untenable and unfit for a semi-permanent installation. The area lacked timber and adequate water resources, and the U.S. considered it \"hostile\" territory, with Native Americans often raiding the area. In 1862, an entire town, Henrietta, northwest of Buffalo Springs, was abandoned due to lack of security. As a result, the U.S. 6th Cavalry Regiment moved south to the present location of Fort Richardson.\\n\\nIn 1867, construction began by the 6th Cavalry on the site along \"Lost Creek, a small tributary of the West Fork of the Trinity River\", at a cost of $800,000, and occupied on 26 November. It became the anchor of the frontier fort system, and the last army outpost in north Texas along the military road to Fort Sill. \"Originally a five-company post, it was expanded...to accommodate ten or more companies\" so that in 1872, with a population of 666 officers and men, it was listed as the largest U.S. Army installation in the United States. The old-time cowboy author Frank H. Maynard spent time at Fort Richardson in 1872 while he had come to Jacksboro on a cattle drive.\\n\\nUnits that occupied the fort included the 6th Cavalry Regiment, the 4th Cavalry Regiment, and the U.S. 11th Infantry Regiment, along with parts of the 10th Cavalry Regiment and 24th Infantry Regiment (United States), both Buffalo Soldier regiments.\\n\\nLife was hard for a soldier at Fort Richardson. Routine duties included long, arduous patrols along the frontier from Clay and Jack Counties west to Palo Duro Canyon near present-day Amarillo. Battles with Comanche and Kiowa Indians became commonplace as the U.S. cavalry and infantry units sought to prove their ability to repel attacks and facilitate white settlement.\\n\\nIn 1871 while touring the system, General William T. Sherman stayed at Fort Richardson and narrowly missed the Warren Wagon Train Raid. General Sherman arrived at Fort Sill and arrested Kiowa chiefs Satanta and Big Tree and had them sent to Jacksboro to stand trial for their role in the massacre. In July 1871, they were tried, convicted, and sentenced to death, which was later commuted to life in prison. They were the first Indians tried and convicted in a Texas civil court system.\\n\\nFollowing these events, General Sherman authorized the commander of the 4th Cavalry, Colonel Ranald S. Mackenzie, to begin offensive operations against the Comanche and Kiowa in the Texas Panhandle. One scouting party fought in the Battle of Palo Duro Canyon in September 1874, a U.S. victory that ended the Red River War with Quanah Parker\\'s Comanches and Red Warbonnet\\'s Kiowas. The cavalry captured so much of the tribes\\' provisions that they were forced to move back to reservations in Oklahoma before winter. This battle was largely responsible for the end to Comanche and Kiowa raids along the northern frontier between Oklahoma and Texas.\\n\\nSection::::Abandonment and Reuse.\\nAfter its victory, the army saw no need to maintain Fort Richardson and abandoned the post on May 23, 1878. \"It was used as an Indian school for a short time afterwards\". The 55 buildings, many made of stone and cottonwood lumber, fell into disrepair. Thanks to a group of Jacksboro residents, the fort was declared a state historic site in 1963 and came under the management of the Texas Parks and Wildlife Department. In 1968, extensive renovations began, and in 1973, it reopened as \"Fort Richardson State Historic Park.\"\\n\\nToday it is called Fort Richardson State Park, Historic Site and Lost Creek Reservoir State Trailway. Visitors can tour seven restored original buildings, including the post hospital, officers\\' quarters, powder magazine, morgue, commissary, guardhouse, and bakery. Two replica buildings of the enlisted men\\'s barracks and the officer\\'s barracks house the Interpretive Center.

With her trademark pageboy bob haircut and dark sunglasses, Wintour has become an important figure in much of the fashion world, widely praised for her eye for fashion trends and her support for younger designers. Her reportedly aloof and demanding personality has earned her the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour\".\\n\\nHer father, Charles Wintour, editor of the London \"Evening Standard\" (1959â76), consulted her on how to make the newspaper relevant to the youth of the era. She became interested in fashion as a teenager. Her career in fashion journalism began at two British magazines. Later, she moved to the US, with stints at \"New York\" and \"House & Garden\". She returned to London and was the editor of British \"Vogue\" between 1985 and 1987. A year later, she assumed control of the franchise\\'s magazine in New York, reviving what many saw as a stagnating publication. Her use of the magazine to shape the fashion industry has been the subject of debate within it. Animal rights activists have attacked her for promoting fur, while other critics have charged her with using the magazine to promote elitist views of femininity and beauty.\\n\\nA former personal assistant, Lauren Weisberger, wrote the 2003 bestselling \"roman Ã  clef\" \"The Devil Wears Prada\", later made into a successful film starring Meryl Streep as Miranda Priestly, a fashion editor, believed to be based on Wintour. In 2009, she was the focus of another film, R. J. Cutler\\'s documentary \"The September Issue\".\\n\\nSection::::Family.\\nWintour was born in Hampstead, London in 1949, to Charles Wintour (1917â1999), editor of the \"Evening Standard\", and Eleanor \"Nonie\" Trego Baker (1917â1995), an American, the daughter of a Harvard law professor. Her parents married in 1940 and divorced in 1979. Wintour was named after her maternal grandmother, Anna Baker (nÃ©e Gilkyson), a merchant\\'s daughter from Pennsylvania. Audrey Slaughter, a magazine editor who founded publications such as \"Honey\" and \"Petticoat\", is her stepmother.\\n\\nThe late-18th-century novelist Lady Elizabeth Foster, Duchess of Devonshire, was Wintour\\'s great-great-great-grandmother, and Sir Augustus Vere Foster, the last Baronet of that name, was a granduncle.\\n\\nShe had four siblings. Her older brother, Gerald, died in a traffic accident as a child. One of her younger brothers, Patrick, is also a journalist, currently diplomatic editor of \"The Guardian\". James and Nora Wintour have worked in London local government and for international non-governmental organisations, respectively.\\n\\nShe lives in Greenwich Village.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nIn her youth, Wintour was educated at the independent North London Collegiate School, where she frequently rebelled against the dress code by taking up the hemlines of her skirts. At the age of 14, she began wearing her hair in a bob. She developed an interest in fashion as a regular viewer of Cathy McGowan on \"Ready Steady Go!,\" and from the issues of \"Seventeen\" which her grandmother sent from the United States. \"Growing up in London in the \\'60s, you\\'d have to have had Irving Penn\\'s sack over your head not to know something extraordinary was happening in fashion,\" she recalled. Her father regularly consulted her when he was considering ideas for increasing readership in the youth market.\\n\\nAt the age of 15, she began dating well-connected older men. She was involved briefly with Piers Paul Read, then 24. In her later teens, she and gossip columnist Nigel Dempster became a fixture on the London club circuit.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSection::::From fashion to journalism.\\n\"I think my father really decided for me that I should work in fashion,\" she recalled in \"The September Issue\". He arranged for his daughter\\'s first job, at the influential Biba boutique, when she was 15. The next year, she left North London Collegiate and began a training program at Harrods. At her parents\\' behest, she also took fashion classes at a nearby school. Soon she gave them up, saying, \"You either know fashion or you don\\'t.\" Another older boyfriend, Richard Neville, gave her her first experience of magazine production at his popular and controversial \"Oz\".\\n\\nIn 1970, when \"Harper\\'s Bazaar UK\" merged with \"Queen\" to become \"Harper\\'s & Queen\", Wintour was hired as one of its first editorial assistants, beginning her career in fashion journalism. She told her co-workers that she wanted to edit \"Vogue\". While there, she discovered model Annabel Hodin, a former North London classmate. Her connections helped her secure locations for innovative shoots by Helmut Newton, Jim Lee and other trend-setting photographers. One recreated the works of Renoir and Manet using models in go-go boots. After chronic disagreements with her rival, Min Hogg, she quit and moved to New York with her boyfriend, freelance journalist Jon Bradshaw.\\n\\nSection::::New York City.\\nIn her new home, she became a junior fashion editor at \"Harper\\'s Bazaar\" in New York City in 1975. Wintour\\'s innovative shoots led editor Tony Mazzola to fire her after nine months. She was reportedly introduced to Bob Marley by one of Bradshaw\\'s friends, and disappeared with him for a week; in a 2017 appearance on \"The Late Late Show with James Corden\", she said she had never actually met the reggae legend, but certainly would have \"hooked up\" with him if she had. A few months later, Bradshaw helped her get her first position as a fashion editor, at \"Viva\", a women\\'s adult magazine started by Kathy Keeton, then wife of \"Penthouse\" publisher Bob Guccione. She has rarely discussed working there, due to that connection. This was the first job at which she was able to hire a personal assistant, which began her reputation as a demanding and difficult boss.\\n\\nIn late 1978, Guccione shut down the unprofitable magazine. Wintour decided to take some time off from work. She broke up with Bradshaw and began a relationship with French record producer Michel Esteban, for two years dividing her time with him between Paris and New York. She returned to work in 1980, succeeding Elsa Klensch as fashion editor for a new women\\'s magazine named \"Savvy\". It sought to appeal to career-conscious professional women, who spent their own money, the readers Wintour would later target at \"Vogue\".\\n\\nThe following year, she became fashion editor of \"New York.\" There, the fashion spreads and photo shoots she had been putting together for years finally began attracting attention. Editor Edward Kosner sometimes bent very strict rules for her and let her work on other sections of the magazine. She learned through her work on a cover involving Rachel Ward how effectively celebrity covers sold copies. \"Anna saw the celebrity thing coming before everyone else did,\" Grace Coddington said three decades later. A former colleague arranged for an interview with \"Vogue\" editor Grace Mirabella that ended when Wintour told Mirabella she wanted her job.\\n\\nSection::::CondÃ© Nast.\\nShe went to work at \"Vogue\" later when Alex Liberman, editorial director for CondÃ© Nast, publisher of \"Vogue\", talked to Wintour about a position there in 1983. She eventually accepted after a bidding war that doubled her salary, becoming the magazine\\'s first creative director, a position with vaguely defined responsibilities. Her changes to the magazine were often made without Mirabella\\'s knowledge, causing friction among the staff. She began dating child psychiatrist David Shaffer, an older acquaintance from London. They married in 1984.\\n\\nIn 1985, Wintour attained her first editorship, taking over the UK edition of \"Vogue\" after Beatrix Miller retired. Once in charge, she replaced many of the staff and exerted far more control over the magazine than any previous editor had, earning the nickname \"Nuclear Wintour\" in the process. Those editors who were retained began to refer to the period as \"The Wintour of Our Discontent.\" Her changes moved the magazine from its traditional eccentricity to a direction more in line with the American magazine. Wintour\\'s ideal reader was the same woman \"Savvy\" had tried to reach. \"There\\'s a new kind of woman out there,\" she told the \"Evening Standard.\" \"She\\'s interested in business and money. She doesn\\'t have time to shop anymore. She wants to know what and why and where and how.\"\\n\\nIn 1987, Wintour returned to New York to take over \"House & Garden.\" Its circulation had long lagged behind rival \"Architectural Digest,\" and CondÃ© Nast hoped she could improve it. Again, she made radical changes to staff and look, canceling $2\\xa0million worth of photo spreads and articles in her first week. She put so much fashion in photo spreads that it became known as \"House & Garment\", and enough celebrities that it was referred to as \"Vanity Chair\", within the industry.\\n\\nThose changes worsened the magazine\\'s problems. When the title was shortened to just \"HG\", many longtime subscribers thought they were getting a new magazine and put it aside for the real thing to arrive. Most of those subscriptions were eventually canceled, and while some fashion advertisers came over, most of the magazine\\'s traditional advertisers pulled out.\\n\\nTen months later, she became editor of US \"Vogue\". Under Mirabella, it had become more focused on lifestyles as a whole and less on fashion. Industry insiders worried that it was losing ground to the recently introduced American edition of \"Elle\". After making sweeping changes in staff, she changed the style of the cover pictures. Mirabella had preferred tight head shots of well-known models in studios; Wintour\\'s covers showed more of the body and were taken outside, like those Diana Vreeland had done years earlier. She used less well-known models, and mixed inexpensive clothes with high fashion: the first issue she was in charge of, November 1988, featured a Peter Lindbergh photograph of 19-year-old Michaela Bercu in a $50 pair of faded jeans and a bejeweled jacket by Christian Lacroix worth $10,000. It was the first time a \"Vogue\" cover model had worn jeans (Bercu was originally supposed to have worn the skirt that coordinated with the jacket, but she had gained some weight and it didn\\'t fit).\\n\\nIn 2012, Wintour reflected on the cover:\\n\\nYears later, Wintour admitted the photo had never been planned as the cover shot. In 2011, when \"Vogue\" put its entire archive online, Wintour was quoted as saying, \"I just said, \\'Well, let\\'s just try this.\\' And off we went. It was just very natural. To me it just said, \\'This is something new. This is something different.\\' The printers called to make sure that was supposed to be the cover, as they thought a mistake might have been made.\" In 2015 she said if she had to pick a favorite of her covers, it would be that one. \"[I]t was a leap of faith and it was certainly a big change for \"Vogue\".\"\\n\\n\"Wintour\\'s approach hit a nerveâthis was the way real women put clothes together (with the likely exception of wearing multi-thousand-dollar T-shirts),\" one reviewer says. On the June 1989 cover, another model was shown in wet hair, with just a bathrobe and no apparent makeup. Photographers, makeup artists, and hairstylists got credited along with the models. In August 2014, Gigi Hadid paid tribute to Wintour\\'s first cover.\\n\\nSection::::1990s.\\nUnder her editorship, the magazine renewed its focus on fashion and returned to the prominence it had held under Vreeland. \"Vogue\" held its position as market leader against three contenders: \"Elle\"; \"Harper\\'s Bazaar\", which had lured away Liz Tilberis, Wintour\\'s most prominent deputy, and \"Mirabella\", a magazine Rupert Murdoch created for Wintour\\'s fired predecessor. Her most serious competitor was within the company: Tina Brown, editor of \"Vanity Fair\" and later \"The New Yorker\".\\n\\nAt the end of the decade, another of Wintour\\'s inner circle left to run \"Harper\\'s Bazaar\". Kate Betts, seen as Wintour\\'s likely successor, had broadened the magazine\\'s reach by commissioning stories with a more hard-news edge, about women in politics, street culture, and the financial difficulties of some major designers. She had also added the \"Index\" section, a few pages of tips meant to be torn out of the magazine. At staff meetings, she earned Wintour\\'s respect as the only person who publicly challenged her.\\n\\nThe two began to disagree about the magazine\\'s direction. Betts felt \"Vogue\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s fashion coverage was getting too limited. Wintour in turn thought that the stories with popular culture angles Betts was assigning were beneath readers, and began pairing Betts with Plum Sykes, whom Betts reportedly detested as a \"pretentious airhead.\" Eventually, she left, complaining to \"The New York Times\" that Wintour had not even sent her a baby gift. Wintour wrote an editor\\'s letter that complimented Betts and wished her well.\\n\\nSection::::2000s.\\nBetts was one of several longtime editors to leave \"Vogue\" around the new millennium. A year later, Sykes, another putative successor, left to concentrate on her best-selling novels set in the city\\'s upper classes and a screenplay. A number of other editors also left to assume the top jobs at other publications. While some of their replacements didn\\'t last, a new group of core editors formed.\\n\\nThe September 2004 issue was 832 pages, the largest issue of a monthly magazine ever published at that time, since exceeded by the September 2007 issue Cutler\\'s documentary covered. Wintour oversaw the introduction of three spinoffs: \"Teen Vogue\", \"Vogue Living\" and \"Men\\'s Vogue.\" \"Teen Vogue\" has published more ad pages and earned more advertiser revenue than either \"Elle Girl\" and \"Cosmo Girl\", and the 164 ad pages in the dÃ©but issue of \"Men\\'s Vogue\" were the most for a first issue in CondÃ© Nast history. \"AdAge\" named her \"Editor of the Year\" for this brand expansion.\\n\\nQueen Elizabeth II appointed her Officer of the Order of the British Empire (OBE) in the 2008 Birthday Honours.\\n\\nThat year was generally difficult, as the economy worsened. After ruffling feathers at the Milan shows in February, the April issue\\'s cover image of LeBron James and Gisele BÃ¼ndchen brought criticism for its evocation of racial stereotypes. The next month a lavish Karl Lagerfeld gown she wore to the Met\\'s Costume Institute Gala was called \"the worst fashion \"faux pas\" of 2008.\" In the fall, \"Vogue Living\" was suspended indefinitely, and \"Men\\'s Vogue\" cut back to two issues a year as an outsert or supplement to the women\\'s magazine. At the end of the year, December\\'s cover highlighted a disparaging comment Jennifer Aniston made about Angelina Jolie, to the former\\'s displeasure; media observers began speculating that Wintour had lost her touch.\\n\\nIn 2008, rumours arose that she would retire, and be replaced by French \"Vogue\" editor Carine Roitfeld. An editor at Russian \"GQ\" reportedly introduced Russian \"Vogue\" editor Aliona Doletskaya as the next editor of American \"Vogue\". CondÃ© Nast responded by taking out a full-page ad in \"The New York Times\" defending her record. In that same publication, Cathy Horyn later wrote that while Wintour hadn\\'t lost her touch, the magazine had become \"stale and predictable,\" as a reader had recently complained. \"To read \"Vogue\" in recent years is to wonder about the peculiar fascination for the \\'villa in Tuscany\\' story,\" Horyn added. The magazine also dealt awkwardly with the recession, she commented.\\n\\nIn 2009, Wintour began making more media appearances. On a \"60 Minutes\" profile, she said she would not retire. \"To me this is a really interesting time to be in this position and I think it would be in a way irresponsible not to put my best foot forward and lead us into a different time.\" In September, \"The September Issue\", a documentary film by \"The War Room\" producer R.J. Cutler about the production of the September 2007 issue, was released. It focused on the sometimes-difficult relationship between Wintour and creative director Grace Coddington. She appeared on the \"Late Show with David Letterman\" to promote it, defending the relevance of fashion in a tough economy. The American Society of Magazine Editors elected her to its Hall of Fame in 2010.\\n\\nSection::::2010s.\\nIn 2013, CondÃ© Nast announced she would be taking on the position of artistic director for the company\\'s magazines while remaining at \"Vogue\". She assumed some of the responsibilities of Si Newhouse, the company\\'s longtime chairman, who, in his mid-80s at the time, was retreating from his role at CondÃ© Nast to oversee managing Advance Publications, its parent company. A company spokesman told \"The New York Times\" the position was created to keep Wintour. She described it as \"an extension of what I am doing, but on a broader scale.\"\\n\\nIn January 2014, the Metropolitan Museum of Art named its Costume Institute complex after Wintour; First Lady Michelle Obama opened it in May of that year. Wintour starred in \"The Fashion Fund\", which aired on Ovation TV that year as well; she was named the 39th most powerful woman in the world by \"Forbes\".\\n\\nOn the occasion of the 10th anniversary of \"The Devil Wears Prada\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s release, in 2016, \"The Ringer\" noted how Wintour\\'s personal image had evolved since that film\\'s depiction of Miranda Priestley. \"A decade ago this summer, Wintour became a living, breathing avatar for a certain kind of bossâthe terrible kind, with \\'great\\' a halfhearted asterisk,\" wrote Alison Herman. \"\"The Devil Wears Prada\" transformed Wintour\\'s image from that of a mere public figure into that of a cultural icon.\"\\n\\nBut since then, \"Wintour isn\\'t just redeemed. She\\'s openly admired, Arctic chill and all.\" The grievances reflected in the novel and film \"[seem] like an increasingly petty complaint when held up against a readership that remains well into the seven figures and the undisputed edge in ad sales that comes with it. Wintour is seemingly the only person on earth who knows how to run a steady print operation in 2016 ... At 10 years old, Miranda Priestley is iconic but ever-so-slightly out of date. Anna Wintour is still the boss...\"\\n\\nIn a May 2017 ceremony at Buckingham Palace, Wintour was created a Dame Commander of the Order of the British Empire by Queen Elizabeth II for her contributions to fashion and journalism. According to a January 2017 report in \"The Nation\", an American news magazine, it was rumored that Wintour would have become the United States Ambassador to the United Kingdom had Hillary Clinton been elected President of the United States the previous November.\\n\\nSection::::Fashion industry power broker.\\nThrough the years, she has come to be regarded as one of the most powerful people in fashion, setting trends, and anointing new designers. Industry publicists often hear \"Do you want me to go to Anna with this?\" when they have differences with her subordinates. \"The Guardian\" has called her the \"unofficial mayoress\" of New York City. She has encouraged fashion houses such as Christian Dior to hire younger, fresher designers such as John Galliano. Her influence extends outside fashion. She persuaded Donald Trump to let Marc Jacobs use a ballroom at the Plaza Hotel for a show when Jacobs and his partner were short of cash. More recently, she persuaded Brooks Brothers to hire the relatively unknown Thom Browne. A protÃ©gÃ©e at \"Vogue\", Plum Sykes, became a successful novelist, drawing her settings from New York\\'s fashionable Ã©lite.\\n\\nHer salary was reported to be $2 million a year in 2005. In addition, she receives several perks, such as a chauffeured Mercedes S-Class (both in New York and abroad), a $200,000 shopping allowance, and the Coco Chanel Suite at the Hotel Ritz Paris while attending European fashion shows. CondÃ© Nast president S.I. Newhouse had the company make her an interest-free $1.6 million loan to purchase her townhouse in Greenwich Village.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nShe had two children by David Shaffer following their 1984 marriage: Charles (Charlie) born 1985, and Katherine (known as Bee) born 1987. The latter wrote occasional columns for \"The Daily Telegraph\" in 2006, but says she won\\'t follow her mother into fashion. The couple divorced in 1999. Newspapers and gossip columnists claimed her affair with investor Shelby Bryan ended the marriage. She declined to comment. Her friends say Bryan has mellowed her. \"She smiles now and has been seen to laugh,\" the \"Observer\" quoted one as saying.\\n\\nWintour is also a philanthropist. She serves as a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, where she has organised benefits that have raised $50 million for the museum\\'s Costume Institute. She began the CFDA/Vogue Fund in order to encourage, support and mentor unknown fashion designers. She has also raised over $10\\xa0million for AIDS charities since 1990, by organising various high-profile benefits.\\n\\nShe claims to rise before 6a.m., plays tennis and has her hair and makeup done, then gets to \"Vogue\"s offices two hours later. She always arrives at fashion shows well before their scheduled start. \"I use the waiting time to make phone calls and notes; I get some of my best ideas at the shows,\" she says. According to the BBC documentary series \"Boss Woman\", she rarely stays at parties for more than 20\\xa0minutes at a time and goes to bed by 10:15 every night. She exerts a great deal of control over the magazine\\'s visual content. Since her first days as editor, she has required that photographers not begin until she has approved Polaroids of the setup and clothing. Afterwards, they must submit all their work to the magazine, not just their personal choices.\\n\\nHer control over the text is less certain. Her staff claim she reads everything written for publication, but former editor Richard Story has claimed she rarely, if ever, reads any of \"Vogue\"s arts coverage or book reviews. Earlier in her career, she often left writing of the text that accompanied her layouts to others; former coworkers claim she has minimal skills in that area. Today, she writes little for the magazine save the monthly editor\\'s letter. She reportedly has three full-time assistants but sometimes surprises callers by answering the phone herself. She often turns her mobile phone off in order to eat her lunch, usually a steak (or bunless hamburger), undisturbed. High-protein meals have been a habit of hers for a long time. \"It was smoked salmon and scrambled eggs \"every single day\"\" for lunch, says a co-worker at \"Harpers & Queen\". \"She would eat nothing else.\"\\n\\nSection::::Personal fashion preferences.\\nBecause of her position, Wintour\\'s wardrobe is often closely scrutinised and imitated. Earlier in her career, she mixed fashionable T-shirts and vests with designer jeans. When she started at \"Vogue\" as creative director she switched to Chanel suits with miniskirts. She continued to wear them during both pregnancies, opening the skirts slightly in back and keeping her jacket on to cover up. Wintour was listed as \"one of the fifty best-dressed over 50s\" by the \"Guardian\" in March 2013.\\n\\nAccording to biographer Jerry Oppenheimer, her ubiquitous sunglasses are actually corrective lenses, since she suffers from deteriorating vision as her father did. A former colleague he interviewed recalls trying on her Wayfarers in her absence and getting dizzy. \"I think at this point they\\'ve become, you know, really armour,\" Wintour herself told \"60 Minutes\" correspondent Morley Safer, explaining that they allow her to keep her reactions to a show private. As she rebounded from the end of her marriage and the turnover in the magazine\\'s editorial staff, a fellow editor and friend noted that \"she\\'s not hiding behind her glasses anymore. Now she\\'s having fun again.\"\\n\\nSection::::Politics.\\nWintour has been a supporter of the Democratic Party since Hillary Clinton\\'s 2000 Senate run and John Kerry\\'s 2004 presidential run and serving Barack Obama\\'s 2008 and 2012 presidential runs as a \"bundler\" of contributions. In 2008 and 2012, she co-hosted fundraisers with Sarah Jessica Parker, the latter being a 50-person, $40,000-per-person dinner at Parker\\'s West Village town house with Meryl Streep, Michael Kors, and Trey Laird, an advertising executive, among the attendees. She has also teamed with Calvin Klein and Harvey Weinstein on fundraisers during Obama\\'s first term and Donna Karan has been amongst the attendees. In 2013 when \"Vogue\"s former director of communications stepped down, Wintour was rumoured to be looking to hire someone with a political background. Soon after, Wintour hired Hildy Kuryk, a former fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee and Obama\\'s first campaign. She supported Hillary Clinton\\'s 2016 Presidential Campaign, forming part of Clinton\\'s long list of wealthy donors or \"Hillblazers\" as well as serving as Clinton\\'s consultant on her wardrobe choices for key moments of the campaign.\\n\\nSection::::\"The Devil Wears Prada\".\\nLauren Weisberger, a former Wintour assistant who left \"Vogue\" for \"Departures\" along with Richard Story, wrote \"The Devil Wears Prada\" after a writing workshop he suggested she take. It was eagerly anticipated for its supposed insider portrait of Wintour prior to its publication. Wintour told \"The New York Times\", \"I always enjoy a great piece of fiction. I haven\\'t decided whether I am going to read it or not.\" While it has been suggested that the setting and Miranda Priestly were based on \"Vogue\" and Wintour, Weisberger claims she drew not only from her own experiences but those of her friends as well. Wintour herself makes a cameo appearance near the end of the book, where it is said she and Miranda dislike each other.\\n\\nIn the novel, Miranda has many similarities to Wintourâamong them, she is British, has two children, and is described as a major contributor to the Met. Priestly is a tyrant who makes impossible demands of her subordinates, gives them almost none of the information or time necessary to comply and then berates them for their failures to do so.\\n\\nBetts, who had been fired by Harper\\'s after two years during which staffers said she tried too hard to emulate Wintour, reviewed it harshly in \"The New York Times Book Review\":\\nPriestly has some positive qualities. Andrea Sachs, the novel\\'s main character, notes that she makes all the magazine\\'s key editorial decisions by herself and that she has genuine class and style. \"I never for one second didn\\'t know it was an amazing opportunity to assist Anna,\" Weisberger said in 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Film adaptation.\\nThe film version of the novel has not been the only movie to have a character borrowing some aspects of Wintour. Edna Mode\\'s similar hairstyle in \"The Incredibles\" has been noted, Johnny Depp said he partially based the demeanour of Willy Wonka in \"Charlie and the Chocolate Factory\" on Wintour. Fey Sommers in the \"Ugly Betty\" television series was also likened to Wintour, from the trademark bob and sunglasses, to Wintour\\'s last name homophonous with \\'Winter\\', while Sommers\\' is homophonous with \\'Summer\\'.\\n\\nDuring the film\\'s production in 2005, Wintour was reportedly threatening prominent fashion personalities, particularly designers, that \"Vogue\" would not cover them if they made cameo appearances in the movie as themselves. She denied it through a spokesperson who said she was interested in anything that \"supports fashion.\" Many designers are mentioned in the film. Only one, Valentino Garavani, appeared as himself.\\n\\nThe film was released, in mid-2006, to great commercial success. Wintour attended the premiÃ¨re wearing Prada. In the film, actress Meryl Streep plays a Priestly different enough from the book\\'s to receive critical praise as an entirely original (and more sympathetic) character. (Streep\\'s office in the film was similar enough to Wintour\\'s that Wintour reportedly had hers redecorated.)\\n\\nWintour reportedly said the film would probably go straight to DVD. It made over $300\\xa0million in worldwide box office receipts. Later in 2006, in an interview with Barbara Walters that aired the day of the DVD\\'s release, Wintour said she found the film \"really entertaining\" and praised it for making fashion \"entertaining and glamorous and interesting ... I was 100 percent behind it.\"\\n\\nThat opinion of the movie has not yet led her to forgive Weisberger. When it was reported that the novelist\\'s editor told her to start her third novel over, Wintour\\'s spokesman suggested she \"should get a job as someone else\\'s assistant.\"\\n\\nOppenheimer suggests \"The Devil Wears Prada\" may have done Wintour a favour by increasing her name recognition. \"Besides giving Weisberger her fifteen minutes,\" he says, \"[it] ... place[d] Anna squarely in the mainstream celebrity pantheon. [She] was now known and talked about over Big Macs and french fries under the Golden Arches by young fashionistas in Wal-Mart denim in Davenport and Dubuque.\"\\n\\nWhen \"The September Issue\" was released three years later, critics compared it with the earlier, fictional film. \"For the past year or so, she\\'s been on the media warpath to win back her image,\" said Paul Schrodt in \"Slant Magazine\". Many considered the question of how similar she was to Streep\\'s Priestly, and praised the film for showing the real person. Manohla Dargis at \"The New York Times\" said that Priestly had helped humanise Wintour, and \"the documentary continues this.\" \"The movie offers insights that lift it beyond a realist version of \"The Devil Wears Prada,\"\" agreed Mary Pols in \"Time\".\\n\\nSection::::Criticism.\\nIn 2005, two years after \"The Devil Wears Prada\", Oppenheimer\\'s \"Front Row: The Cool Life and Hot Times of Vogue\\'s Editor in Chief\" was published. It painted a similar portrait of the real woman. According to Oppenheimer, Wintour not only declined his requests for an interview but discouraged others from talking to him.\\n\\nSection::::Personality.\\nWintour is often described as emotionally distant by those who have come to know her well, even her close friends. \"At some stage in her career, Anna Wintour stopped being Anna Wintour and became \\'Anna Wintour,\\' at which point, like wings of a stately home, she closed off large sections of her personality to the public,\" wrote \"The Guardian\". \"I think she enjoys not being completely approachable. Just her office is very intimidating. You have to walk about a mile into the office before you get to her desk and I\\'m sure it\\'s intentional,\" Coddington says. \"I don\\'t find her to be accessible to people she doesn\\'t need to be accessible to,\" agrees \"Vogue\" publisher Tom Florio.\\n\\nShe has said she admired her father Charles, known as \"Chilly Charlie\" for being \"inscrutable.\" Former coworkers told Oppenheimer of a similar aloofness on her part. But she is also known for volatile outbursts of displeasure, and the widely used \"Nuclear Wintour\" sobriquet is a result of both. She dislikes it enough to have asked \"The New York Times\" not to use it. \"There are times I get quite angry,\" she admitted in \"The September Issue\".\\n\\n\"I think she has been very rude to a lot of people in the past, on her way up â very terse,\" a friend told the \"Observer\". \"She doesn\\'t do small talk. She is never going to be friends with her assistant.\" A former assistant said, \"You definitely did not ride the elevator with her.\" Unwritten rules imposed by Wintour at the \"Vogue\" offices forbid junior staff from initiating conversation with her; an editor who greeted her on the elevator was reprimanded by one of Wintour\\'s assistants. (She calls that an exaggeration.) A visiting reporter saw a junior staff member appear visibly panicked when she realised she would have to be in the elevator with Wintour. Once a junior editor saw her trip in the hallway, walked past without offering assistance, and was later told she \"did \"absolutely\" the right thing.\"\\n\\nEven friends admit to some trepidation in her presence. \"Anna happens to be a friend of mine,\" says Barbara Amiel, \"a fact which is of absolutely no help in coping with the cold panic that grips me whenever we meet.\" \"I know when to stop pushing her,\" says Coddington. \"She doesn\\'t know when to stop pushing me.\"\\n\\nShe has often been described as a perfectionist who routinely makes impossible, arbitrary demands of subordinates: \"kitchen scissors at work,\" in the words of one commentator. She once made a junior staffer look through a photographer\\'s trash to find a picture he had refused to give her. In a deleted scene from \"The September Issue\", she complains about the \"horrible white plastic buckets\" of ice behind the bars at the CFDA\\'s 7th on Sale AIDS benefit and moves them out of sight. \"The notion that Anna would want something done \\'now\\' and not \\'shortly\\' is accurate,\" Amiel says of \"The Devil Wears Prada\". \"Anna wants what she wants right away.\" A longtime assistant says, \"She throws you in the water and you\\'ll either sink or swim.\"\\n\\nPeter Braunstein, the former \"Women\\'s Wear Daily\" (WWD) media reporter, later convicted of sexually assaulting a coworker, allegedly planned to kill Wintour because of perceived slights. After receiving only one ticket to the 2002 \"Vogue\" Fashion Awards, which he perceived as a snub, he became so angry that \"WWD\" fired him. At his 2007 trial, prosecutors introduced as evidence a journal he kept on his computer in which he stated his intention to kill her. In it he wrote, \"She just never talked to peons like us\" to justify his intended actions.\\n\\nOn one occasion, she has had to pay for her treatment of employees. In 2004, a court ruled that she and Shaffer were to pay $104,403, and Wintour herself an additional $32,639, to settle a lawsuit brought against them by the New York State Workers\\' Compensation Board. They had failed to pay the $140,000 judgement it incurred on behalf of a former employee injured on the job, who did not have the necessary insurance coverage.\\n\\nIn the 2000s, her relationship with Bryan was credited with softening her personality at work. \"Even when she\\'s in a bad mood, she has a different posture,\" someone described as a \"Wintour watcher\" told the \"New York Observer\". \"The consensus is that she\\'s so much more mellow and easier to work for ...\"\\n\\nSection::::Pro-fur stance.\\nShe has often been the target of animal rights organisations like PETA, who are angered by her use of fur in \"Vogue\", her pro-fur editorials and her refusal to run paid advertisements from animal rights organisations. Undeterred, she continues to use fur in photo spreads, saying there\\'s always a way to wear it. \"Nobody was wearing fur until she put it on the cover in the early 1990s,\" says Vogue co-worker Tom Florio. \"She ignited the entire industry.\"\\n\\nShe has \"lost count\" of the times she has been physically attacked by activists. In Paris in October 2005, she was hit with a tofu pie while waiting to get into the ChloÃ© show. On another occasion, an activist dumped a dead raccoon on her plate at a restaurant; she told the waiter to remove it. She and \"Vogue\" publisher Ron Galotti once retaliated for a protest outside the CondÃ© Nast offices during the company\\'s annual Christmas party by sending down a plate of roast beef.\\n\\nOthers outside of the animal-rights community have raised the fur issue. Fashion journalist Peter Braunstein wrote in his manifesto that she would go to a hell guarded by large rats, where it would be so warm she wouldn\\'t need to wear fur. Pamela Anderson, in an early 2008 interview, said Wintour was the living person she most despised \"because she bullies young designers and models to use and wear fur.\"\\n\\nSection::::Elitism.\\nAnother common criticism of Wintour\\'s editorship focuses on \"Vogue\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s increasing use of celebrities on the cover, and her insistence on making them meet her standards. She reportedly told Oprah Winfrey to lose weight before her cover photograph. Likewise, Hillary Clinton was told not to wear a blue suit. At the 2005 Anglomania celebration, a \"Vogue\"-sponsored salute to British fashion at the Met, Wintour is said to have personally chosen the clothes for prominent attendees such as Jennifer Lopez, Kate Moss, Donald Trump, and Diane von FÃ¼rstenberg. \"I don\\'t think Vreeland had that kind of concentration,\" says \"WWD\" publisher Patrick McCarthy. \"She wouldn\\'t have dressed Babe Paley. Nor would Babe Paley have let her.\" By persuading designers to loan clothes to prominent socialites and celebrities, who are then photographed wearing the clothes not only in \"Vogue\" but more general-interest magazines like \"People\" and \"Us\", which in turn influence what buyers want, some in the industry believe Wintour is exerting too much control over it, especially since she is not involved in making or producing clothes herself. \"The end result is that Anna can control it all the way to the selling floor,\" says Candy Pratts Price, executive fashion director at style.com. She has been credited with killing grunge fashion in the early 1990s, when it wasn\\'t selling well, by telling designers if they continued to avoid glamour their looks would not be photographed for \"Vogue\". All complied.\\n\\nAnother \"Vogue\" writer has complained Wintour excluded ordinary working women, many of whom are regular subscribers, from the pages. \"She\\'s obsessed only about reflecting the aspirations of a certain class of reader,\" she says. \"We once had a piece about breast cancer which started with an airline stewardess, but she wouldn\\'t have a stewardess in the magazine so we had to go and look for a high-flying businesswoman who\\'d had cancer.\"\\n\\nWintour has been accused of setting herself apart even from peers. \"I do not think fiction could surpass the reality,\" a British fashion magazine editor says of \"The Devil Wears Prada.\" \"[A]rt in this instance is only a poor imitation of life.\" Wintour, the editor says, routinely requests to be seated out of sight of competing editors at shows. \"We spend our working lives telling people which it-bag to carry but Anna is so above the rest of us she does not even have a handbag.\"\\n\\nAt Milan Fashion Week in 2008, she requested that some key shows be rescheduled for earlier in the week so she and other U.S.-based editors could have time to return home before the Paris shows. This led to complaints. Other editors said they had to rush through the earlier shows, and lesser-known designers who had to show later were denied an important audience. Dolce & Gabbana said Italian fashion was getting short shrift and Milan was becoming a \"circus without sense.\"\\n\\nGiorgio Armani, who at the time was co-chairing a Met exhibition on superheroes\\' costumes with Wintour, drew some attention for his personal remarks. \"Maybe what she thinks is a beautiful dress, I wouldn\\'t think was a beautiful dress,\" he said. While he claimed he couldn\\'t understand why people disliked her, saying he himself was indifferent, he expressed hope she hadn\\'t made a comment once attributed to her \"the Armani era is over.\" He accused her of preferring French and American fashion over Italian. Geoffrey Beene, who stopped inviting Wintour to shows after she stopped writing about him, called her \"a boss lady in four-wheel drive who ignores or abandons those who do not fuel her tank. As an editor, she has turned class into mass, taste into waste.\"\\n\\nHer remarks about obesity have caused controversy on more than one occasion. In 2005, Wintour was heavily criticised by the New York chapter of the National Association to Advance Fat Acceptance after \"Vogue\" editor-at-large AndrÃ© Leon Talley said on \"The Oprah Winfrey Show\", at one point, Wintour demanded he lose weight. \"Most of the \"Vogue\" girls are so thin, tremendously thin\" he said, \"because Miss Anna doesn\\'t like fat people.\" In 2009, residents of Minneapolis took umbrage after she told \"60 Minutes\" she could \"only kindly describe most of the people I saw as little houses.\" They noted their city had been named the third fittest in the nation that year by \"Men\\'s Fitness\" while New York had been named the fifth fattest.\\n\\nWintour surprised observers when developing an association with the Kardashian family and Kanye West, which culminated in having the Kardashian-Wests on a \"Vogue cover\"; Wintour reportedly commented that having only \"deeply tasteful\" people in the magazine was boring, and her decision to resort to such personalities has led some to accuse the magazine of being \"desperate for buzz.\" Wintour has nevertheless continued the association with the less-than-\"deeply tasteful\" pair.\\n\\nSection::::Responses.\\nDefences of Wintour have often come from others. Amanda Fortini at \"Slate\" said she was comfortable with Wintour\\'s elitism since that was intrinsic to fashion:\\n\\nEmma Brockes sees this in Wintour herself: \"[Her] unwavering ability to look as if she lives within the pages of her magazine has a sort of honesty to it, proof that, whatever one thinks about it, the lifestyle peddled by Vogue is at least physically possible.\"\\n\"Print publications have to be as luxurious an experience as possible,\" Wintour explained in 2015. \"You have to feel it coming off the page. You have to see photographs and pieces that you couldn\\'t possibly see anywhere else.\"\\n\\nSome friends see her purported coldness as just traditional British reserve, or shyness. Brockes says it may be mutual, \"partly a reflection of how awkward people are with her, particularly women, who get preemptively chippy when faced with the prospect of meeting Fashion Incarnate.\" Wintour describes herself as shy, and Harry Connick Jr., who escorted her and Bee to shows in 2007, agrees. When Morley Safer asked her about complaints about her personality, she said,\\n\\nShe has made similar statements in defence of her reported refusal to hire fat people. \"It\\'s important to me that the people that are working here, particularly in the fashion department,\" she says, \"will present themselves in a way that makes sense to the outside world that they work at \"Vogue.\"\"\\n\\nHer defenders have called criticism sexist. \"Powerful women in the media always get inspected more thoroughly than their male counterparts,\" said \"The New York Times\" in a piece about Wintour shortly after \"The Devil Wears Prada\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>s release. When she took over at \"Vogue\", gossip columnist Liz Smith reported rumours she had gotten the job through an affair with Si Newhouse. A reportedly furious Wintour made her anger the subject of one of her first staff meetings. She still complained about it when accepting a media award in 2002.\\n\\nShe has been called a feminist whose changes to \"Vogue\" have reflected, acknowledged, and reinforced advances in the status of women. Reviewing Oppenheimer\\'s book in the \"Washington Monthly\", managing editor Christina Larson notes that \"Vogue\", unlike many other women\\'s magazines,\\nWintour, unlike Vreeland, \"...shifted \"Vogue\"s focus from the cult of beauty to the cult of the creation of beauty.\" To her, the focus on celebrities is a welcome development as it means women are making the cover of \"Vogue\" at least in part for what they have accomplished, not just how they look.\\n\\nComplaints about her role as fashion \"eminence grise\" are dismissed by those familiar with how she actually exercises it. \"She\\'s honest. She tells you what she thinks. Yes is yes and no is no,\" according to Karl Lagerfeld. \"She\\'s not too pushy\", agrees FranÃ§ois-Henri Pinault, chief executive officer of PPR, Gucci\\'s parent company. \"She lets you know it\\'s not a problem if you can\\'t do something she wants.\" Defenders also point out she continued supporting Gucci despite her strong belief PPR should not have let Tom Ford go. Designers such as Alice Roi and Isabel Toledo have flourished without indulging Wintour or \"Vogue\". Her willingness to throw her weight around has helped keep \"Vogue\" independent despite its heavy reliance on advertising dollars. Wintour was the only fashion editor who refused to follow an Armani ultimatum to feature more of its clothes in the magazine\\'s editorial pages, although she has also admitted if she has to choose between two dresses, one by an advertiser and the other not, she will choose the former every time. \"Commercial is not a dirty word to me.\"\\n\\nWintour herself, when asked about it, dismisses the notion that she has all the power attributed to her. \"I don\\'t think of myself as a powerful person,\" she told \"Forbes\" in 2011, when it named her 69th on its list of the world\\'s hundred most powerful women. \"You know, what does it mean? It means you get a better seat in a restaurant or tickets to a screening or whatever it may be. But it is a wonderful opportunity to be able to help others, and for that I\\'m extremely grateful.\"\\n\\nIn response to criticisms like Beene\\'s, she has defended the democratisation of what were once exclusive luxury brands. \"It means more people are going to get better fashion,\" she told Dana Thomas. \"And the more people who can have fashion, the better.\"\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Anna Wintour', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730578'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'wgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7305907', 'text': \"Ribault Inn Club\\n\\nThe Ribault Club is an historic building on Fort George Island near Jacksonville, Florida.

The book was published originally as in 1981, and became an \"instant bestseller\" in Japan. The book is about the values of the unconventional education that Kuroyanagi received at Tomoe Gakuen, a Tokyo elementary school founded by educator Sosaku Kobayashi during World War II.\\n\\nThe Japanese name of the book is an expression used to describe people who have failed.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nAfter hearing about how children were refusing to attend school, Tetsuko decided to write about her experience attending Tomoe Gakuen. \"Totto-chan\" was originally published in Japan as a series of articles in Kodansha\\'s \"Young Woman\" magazine appearing from February 1979 through December 1980. The articles were then collected into a book, which made Japanese publishing history by selling more than 5 million before the end of 1982, which made the book break all previous publishing records and become the bestselling book in Japanese history.\\n\\nAn English edition, translated by Dorothy Britton, was published in America in 1984. The book has been translated into a number of languages, including, Arabic, Burmese, Chinese, French, Italian, German, Korean, Malay, Tagalog, Vietnamese, Indonesian, Thai, Russian, Uyghur, Sinhala, and Lao, and many Indian languages including Hindi, Marathi, Gujarati, Telugu, Assamese, Kannada, Tamil, Malayalam, Bengali and Oriya.\\n\\nA bilingual collection of stories from the book, entitled \"Best of Totto-chan: Totto Chan: The Little Girl at the Window\", was published in 1996.\\n\\nSection::::Plot synopsis.\\nThe book begins with Totto-chan\\'s mother coming to know of her daughter\\'s expulsion from public school. Her mother realizes that Totto-chan needs a school where more freedom of expression is permitted. Thus, she takes Totto-chan to meet the headmaster of the new school, Mr. Kobayashi, where the two establish a friendly teacher-student relationship.\\n\\nThe book describes the friends Totto-chan makes, the lessons she learns, and the vibrant atmosphere she enjoys at Tomoe Gakuen. Mr. Kobayashi introduces new activities to interest the pupils. Mr. Kobayashi understands children and strives to develop their minds and bodies. He is concerned for the physically handicapped and his emphasizes how all children are remarkable. \"Totto-chan\" makes best friends with a Christian boy who has polio. Another classmate was raised in America for all his life and cannot speak Japanese, and the headmaster tells the children to learn English from him, despite governmental restraints against using the \"enemy\\'s\" language. The epilogue explains how Headmaster Kobayashi had good connections with leaders in government.\\n\\nBut in this the school, the children lead happy lives, unaware of the things going on in the world. World War II has started, yet in this school, no signs of it are seen. There are hints of something awry when \"Totto-chan\" cannot buy caramel candies from the vending machine on her way to school, and it becomes harder for her mother to meet the requirements for a balanced lunch. In another scene, there is a boy who is bawling his eyes out at being removed from the school by his parents, with Headmaster Kobayashi helplessly letting the student vent with tears forming in his own eyes.\\n\\nOne day, the school is bombed, and is never rebuilt, even though the headmaster claims that he looked forward to building an even better school the next time round. This ends Totto-chan\\'s years as a pupil at Tomoe Gakuen.\\n\\nSection::::Use in classrooms.\\nStarting in 1983, it was used as a textbook for third-year Japanese elementary students, and at least one American school used material from it in 1993.\\n\\nSection::::Related works.\\nKuroyanagi founded the Totto-chan Foundation, which professionally trains deaf actors to bring live theater to the deaf community.\\n\\nIn 1999, Kuroyanagi published her book \"Totto-Chan\\'s Children: A Goodwill Journey to the Children of the World\", about her travels around the world on her humanitarian mission as a UNICEF Goodwill Ambassador.\\n\\nAn orchestral interpretation of the work was written by Japanese composer Akihiro Komori, which was released as a record.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Totto-Chan: The Little Girl at the Window', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=730649'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '73121', 'text': 'Blackmore\\'s Night\\n\\nBlackmore\\'s Night is a British/American traditional folk rock band formed in 1997, consisting mainly of Ritchie Blackmore (acoustic guitar, hurdy gurdy, mandola, mandolin, nyckelharpe and electric guitar) and Candice Night (lead vocals, lyricist and woodwinds). Lineup has seen a lot of changes over the years. To date they have released ten studio albums. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Early.\\nCandice was a Rainbow fan, and first encountered Ritchie Blackmore to ask him for an autograph in 1989, while she was working for a local New York radio station. The two started living together in 1991, and discovered they both had a passionate interest in Renaissance music.\\n\\nDuring the reformed Rainbow\\'s recording of the album \"Stranger in Us All\" in 1995, on which Night contributed some of the lyrics and backing harmony vocals, the duo were already gearing up their debut album. In 1997, the project started as being a pun of their own names, which would consist of themselves plus session musicians.\\n\\nSection::::1997 to 2005.\\nTheir debut album \"Shadow of the Moon\" was a musical success and featured Ian Anderson of Jethro Tull on flute for the song \"Play Minstrel Play\". In subsequent albums, particularly \"Fires at Midnight\", there was an increased incorporation of rock guitar into the music, whilst maintaining a folk rock direction. Over time, Night has increasingly participated instrumentally as well as singing the vocals, and is competent in a wide variety of Renaissance instruments.\\nThe group performs at Renaissance fairs and Renaissance Festivals, as well as in stand-alone concert tours in appropriate venues including \\'castle tours\\' of Europe, where they perform in historic surroundings for an audience dressed largely in period costume. The duo has been successful enough to inspire a number of international tribute bands including: \"Renaissance Night\", the Italian \"Morning Star\" and the \"Midnight\".\\n\\nThey have also performed the music for MagiQuest, a live simulation game.\\n\\nSection::::2006âpresent.\\nIn 2006, Night performed a duet with Andi Deris on Helloween\\'s \"Light the Universe\", which was released as a single in certain countries and is available on their album \"\", released in the same year.\\n\\nOn June 27, 2008, the duo released its seventh studio album called \"Secret Voyage\", a mix of medieval-sounding tracks and some contemporary ones. In addition to some covers of some traditional folk music (âLocked Within the Crystal Ball\" is from the fourteenth century) and some originals, Blackmore\\'s Night also performed a cover of a Rainbow song (âRainbow Eyesâ) and an Elvis Presley cover (\"Can\\'t Help Falling in Love\").\\n\\nA new album titled \"Autumn Sky\" was released soon afterwards. Their latest album, \"All Our Yesterdays\", was released on September 18, 2015.\\nThe band are said to be working on material for a new album with a possible 2019/2020 release date.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nOn October 5, 2008, Night and Blackmore were married after 19 years together.

While down there, Tammy suddenly disappears and Kwirk, with his Veggie Friends, now has to find her in the labyrinth and bring her home.\\n\\nSection::::Gameplay.\\nKwirk has three game modes: Going Up?, Heading Out?, and Vs. Mode, each one with its own set of rules. The object is to get from one end of the room to the staircase on the other by rotating turnstiles, moving blocks, and filling holes with blocks. \\n\\nKwirk has three skill levels: Level 1 - Easy, Level 2 - Average and Level 3 - Hard. After, one of two viewpoints may be selected: Diagonal or Bird\\'s Eye. In Diagonal view, characters and blocks have shadows and appear in crude 3D, whereas in Bird\\'s Eye view everything is 2D, viewed from the top down. The three skill levels and two viewpoints are featured in all three game modes.\\n\\nSection::::Going Up?\\nIn \"Going Up?,\" the object is to go from floor to floor by rotating turnstiles, moving blocks, and filling holes with blocks to get to the staircase on the other side. There are ten floors for each Skill Level for a total of thirty floors. Along the way at certain levels, Kwirk will receive help from his Veggie Friends, who can be taken control of by pressing the Select button. The Going Up? game mode offers a menu screen (upon a press of the A button) that allows the following;\\n\\n\\nScoring is based on the time taken to complete the stage and the number of steps taken to get to the stairs.\\n\\n\"Going Up?\" serves as the story in which Kwirk has to rescue Tammy from the maze. Although the game features no storyline to progress the game, each stage ends with Tammy displaying the score, and after ten floors to each Level, Tammy and Kwirk are reunited.\\n\\nSection::::Heading Out?\\nIn \"Heading Out?\" the object is to complete a certain number of rooms consecutively to get a high score. There are a total of 99 rooms, any of which can be selected to run through by the player. Once started, the player sprints through each room solving the puzzle. Bonus Points are earned upon completion of each room. The Bonus Points start at 2000, decreasing during the course of the room, and resets after entering a new room. A timer is included to track the time through the course. After running through all the rooms the player\\'s score is then recorded on a top four list.\\n\\nSection::::Vs. Mode.\\n\"Vs. Mode\" is a race using \"Heading Out?\" mode between two players. Each player selects a number of rooms to race through, but both player do not have to select the same number of rooms as a handicap. Then a Contest is selected to decide the win condition; 1 Game playoff, or a Best of 3, 5, 7, or 9. Once started, the players can monitor each other through a Progress meter on their respective screens. The match ends when one player completes all the rooms.\\n\\nSection::::Obstacles.\\nIn each room, Kwirk must navigate around and interact with various obstacles in order to progress.\\n\\nObstacles:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Kwirkâs Veggie Friends.\\nAt certain points in the game \"Going Up?,\" one or all of Kwirkâs Veggie Friends will appear to help. They donât have special abilities, but instead play exactly like Kwirk to allow maneuvers that weren\\'t possible with only one character. The player switches between characters by pressing the select button and all of the Veggie Friends must be brought to the stairs to clear the floor.\\n\\nThe Veggie Friends:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nKwirk received largely positive reviews. Reviewers praised the games challenging difficulty. According to \"Mean Machines\", which rated the game a score of 85%, \"Kwirk\" is one of the \"simple, but very addictive\" puzzle games, as stated by Julian Rignall. Because of the number of different screens, it doesn\\'t \"become boring quickly\". Rignall stated the game gets \"incredibly hard\" and \"really taxes\" the player\\'s brain. Matt Regan criticised that once the player has solved each puzzle, there is \"no interest left\". The German magazine \"Video Games\" reviewed \"Kwirk\" in its very first issue and awarded it a \"Video Games Classic\" due to a score of 85%. The magazine\\'s editor Stephan Englhart praised the game\\'s variety of modes and puzzles. He stated that \"Kwirk\" captivates with a \"well-elaborated and harmonious overall concept\" (\"\"wohl durchdachtes und stimmiges Gesamtkonzept\"\").\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nKwirkâs only appearance outside of the Game Boy game, was on television was in the show \"Video Power\", as part of a 15-minute cartoon short called \"The Power Team\", which featured characters from Acclaim games. He usually went berserk whenever anyone calls him a \"to-MAH-to\" and not a \"to-MAY-to\".\\n\\n\"Puzzle Boy\" is one of the video games featured in the manga titled \"Rock\\'n Game Boy\", by Shigeto Ikehara and Published by Comic BomBom October 1989 to December 1991.\\n\\nOn November 16, 1990, \"Kwirk\" got a Japan-only Famicom Disk System version titled . As with the Japanese release of Puzzle Boy, \"Kwirk\" didn\\'t appear in it.\\n\\nNext, a Puzzle Boys spin-off called \"Spud\\'s Adventure\", known as , was released for the Game Boy on January 25, 1991. Unlike \"Kwirk\", in the US \"Spud\\'s Adventure\" was published by Atlus instead of Acclaim Entertainment, due to Acclaim losing their license in publishing Atlus\\'s \"Puzzle Boy\" series of games. Unlike \"Kwirk\", Atlus did not change the protagonist into a tomato, but left him as his original character of a potato, translating his name as \"Spud.\"\\n\\nNext, \"Puzzle Boys\" was ported to the PCEngine on February 22, 1991. Again, it was only released in Japan. \\n\\nThis game later got a proper sequel in the US titled \"Amazing Tater\" (known in Japan as \"Puzzle Boy II\") for the Game Boy. Like \"Spud\\'s Adventure\", the protagonist remains a potato called \"Spud.\"\\n\\nA port for the TI-89 calculator exists, written by Ludvig Strigeus..\\n\\nIn the PlayStation 2 game \"\", which was also developed by Atlus, there is a mini-game that has the same mechanics as \"Kwirk\", with some levels being lifted directly from the Game Boy game.\\n\\nIn October of 2018, the game\\'s rights were acquired by Canadian production company Liquid Media Group along with other titles originally owned by Acclaim Entertainment.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kwirk', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7315110'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'yAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7318083', 'text': 'EnjÅ\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nTold in an intricate flashback structure, \"Enjo\" dramatizes the psychological collapse of Goichi (Raizo Ichikawa), a young Buddhist acolyte from a dysfunctional family who arrives at a Kyoto temple - the Golden Pavilion - for further study.\\n\\nGoichi is haunted by two events - the discovery of his psychologically abusive mother\\'s infidelity, and the effect of the revelation upon his father, who suddenly falls ill and dies shortly thereafter.

There are also a number of candidates who sit STEP papers as a challenge. The papers are designed to test ability to answer questions similar in style to undergraduate Mathematics.\\n\\nThere are two official users of STEP Mathematics: the University of Cambridge and the University of Warwick.\\nCandidates applying to study Mathematics or Computer Science with Mathematics at the University of Cambridge are almost always required to take STEP papers as part of the terms of their conditional offer. In addition, other courses at Cambridge University with a large mathematics component, such as engineering occasionally require STEP. Candidates applying to study Mathematics or closely related subjects at the University of Warwick can take step as part of their offer.\\n\\nA typical STEP offer for a candidate applying to read Mathematics at the University of Cambridge would be at least a grade 1 in both STEP2 and STEP 3. From 2019 some colleges may (depending on the individual applicant's circumstances) require a grade 1 in either STEP 1 or 2, (or in both). Candidates applying to the University of Warwick to read Mathematics, or closely related subjects, can use a grade 1 from any STEP paper as part of their offer.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nBefore 2003, STEP papers were available for a wide range of subjects, including, for example, Chemistry and Biology, but the Mathematics STEP paper is the only one now in use. Three STEP Mathematics papers are set each year and all are sat during the school summer examination cycle.\\n\\nSection::::Format.\\nThere are three STEP papers: STEP 1, STEP 2 and STEP 3. Candidates may enter for as many as they wish, although this is often dictated by the STEP offers they hold. Each paper offers a selection of questions and there is no restriction on which can be answered. For each paper, candidates have three hours to complete their solutions. Whilst students are permitted to answer as many questions as they choose, they are advised to attempt no more than six, and their final grade is based on their six best question solutions. Each question is worth 20 marks, and so the maximum a candidate can score is 120.\\n\\nFor recent examinations, up to and including the 2018 papers, the specification for STEP 1 and STEP 2 was based on Mathematics A Level content while the syllabus for STEP 3 was based on Further Mathematics A Level. The questions on STEP 2 and 3 were about the same difficulty. Both STEP 2 and STEP 3 are harder than STEP 1.\\n\\nFor the 2019 examinations onwards, the specifications have been updated to reflect the reforms in A Level Mathematics and Further Mathematics; in addition, the number of questions in each paper has been reduced. Specifically:\\n\\nSection::::Practicalities.\\nSince June 2009, graph paper has not been allowed in STEP examinations as the test requires only sketches, not detailed graphs. Instead, all graphs should be sketched inside the answer booklets provided as part of a candidate's solution. <br>\\n\\nSince June 2018, the format of the answer booklet for the STEP Mathematics examinations has been updated to ensure that the paper is fully anonymised before it is marked. Candidates are issued with a 44-page booklet, of which 40 pages are available for writing out solutions and for rough work. Only one booklet per candidate is allowed unless a further booklet is required and has been formally requested as a result of specific access arrangements.\\n\\nCandidates are advised to write their answers in black ink and draw pictures in pencil, although some flexibility is permitted with this. Candidates should not use green or red pen at any stage. \\n\\nCalculators may not be used during STEP. Rulers, protractors and compasses can be taken into the examination. Candidates who donât have English as a first language are allowed to use bilingual dictionaries.\\n\\nA formulae booklet was available to all candidates for all examinations up to and including those in 2018. From 2019 onwards, candidates will no longer be issued with a formulae booklet; instead they will be expected to recall, or know how to derive quickly, standard formulae. All the required standard formulae are given in an appendix to the new specification.\\n\\nSection::::Marking.\\nSTEP is marked by teams of mathematicians specially trained for the purpose. All the markers have Mathematics degrees and most are reading for PhDs at Cambridge. Each question is marked by a small team who coordinate to ensure their question is marked fairly and that all correct solutions are given appropriate marks. Markers are closely supervised by a team of marking supervisors, usually senior teachers, who are responsible for the mark scheme and by a senior Mathematics assessment expert.\\nAll non-crossed-out work is assessed and a candidate's final score is based on their six highest scoring solutions. \\nAll papers are checked at least twice to ensure that all of a candidate's non-crossed-out solutions have been assessed. A candidate's marks are then independently entered twice into a database to ensure that there are no clerical errors in mark recording. The mark data is then checked a further time by a small team who hand check a random selection of scripts.\\n\\nSection::::Scoring.\\nThere are five possible grades awarded. From best to worst, these are âSâ (Outstanding), â1â, â2â, â3â, and âUâ (Unclassified). The rule of thumb is that four good answers (to a reasonable level of completion) will gain a grade 1; more may gain an S, and fewer will gain a correspondingly lower grade. The grade boundaries shift from year to year, and the boundaries for STEP 3 are generally a small but appreciable margin lower than those for STEP 2.<br>\\n\\nAll STEP questions are marked out of 20. The mark scheme for each question is designed to reward candidates who make good progress towards a solution. A candidate reaching the correct answer will receive full marks, regardless of the method used to answer the question.<br>\\nAll the questions that are attempted by a student and not crossed out will be assessed. However, only the six best answers will be used in the calculation of the final grade for the paper.\\n\\nSection::::Timing and results.\\nCandidates who have received offers for Mathematics courses at the University of Cambridge sit STEP as a post-interview test. STEP papers are normally sat at a candidate's school or college. Alternatively, the test can be taken at one of Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing's authorised test centres worldwide.\\n\\nEntries for STEP papers are typically accepted from the start of March until the end of April and late entries (with late entry fees) accepted until mid-May. STEP papers are taken mid to late June, with online results available mid-August, issued on the same date as A Level results.\\n\\nSection::::Usage.\\nThere is some variation in how institutions make use of the results â candidates can contact the relevant institution(s) for more information. However, STEP papers are typically taken post-interview and the results used to supplement candidatesâ exam results. For applicants to the University of Cambridge, candidatesâ scripts are made available to admissions officers. This enables officers to make judgements on the basis of candidatesâ actual work, rather than on just their marks or grade.\\n\\nSection::::Preparation.\\nSTEP papers do not require a lot of extra knowledge as they are designed to test skills and knowledge of topics within the A Level syllabus. \\n\\nPractice materials, including past papers, example solutions and a STEP formula booklet, are available for free from the Cambridge Assessment Admissions Testing website.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Sixth Term Examination Paper', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=732577'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'zgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7329238', 'text': 'US Stade Tamponnaise\\n\\nUnion Sportive Stade Tamponnaise is a football club from Le Tampon, RÃ©union Island, founded in 1982 as the result of the merger between S/S Tamponnaise (founded in 1922) and Stade Tamponnais (founded in 1971).\\n\\nSection::::Stadium.\\nThe club plays its home matches at Stade KlÃ©bert Picard, which has a maximum capacity of 4,000 people.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'US Stade Tamponnaise', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7329238'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'zwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7334691', 'text': 'Orangeville Northmen Jr. B\\n\\nThe Orangeville Northmen are Junior \"B\" box lacrosse team from Orangeville, Ontario, Canada.

After finishing school, he studied at the Lette Foundation, a technical college for photography in Berlin. At age 18 he started working as an independent photographer. After two years he was hired by an advertising agency as an assistant photographer and became their head of the photo department a year later. Since the age of 15, Jeglitza was involved in the upcoming hip hop Movement in Germany.\\n\\nSection::::Music career.\\nSection::::1984â88.\\nIn 1984, Jeglitza started working with the Berlin-based DJ Frank Hassas (a.k.a. Quickmix) and later started collaborating with the German producer / musician Micky Wolf. During that time, he met the rapper Aram Mouchegh (The-A) and they became a trio act called \"The Masterplan.\" In 1987, they released their first single \"We wanna be stars\", on the Select record label. The single became a commercial failure. Jeglitza later started to produce the monthly Radio Show called \"Freshline Radio\" and published a German Hip Hop magazine, titled Fresh Beat Magazine.\\n\\nIn 1988, Jeglitza and Hassas together with producer Juergen Wind formed a new project called, The Alliance. The first single release \"Action!\" was released on their own label Freshline Records. The label sold approximately 20,000 units with the help of their distribution partner 99 Records. This first 12\" was followed by more releases, leading them to a first label deal with Rough Trade Records. While \"Action!\" and the second release \"Come into my life â Rap Version\" (The Admirers) ended up being re-released by ZYX Records, the first album of The Alliance (\"Itâs time â¦\") and a couple of other products were released by Rough Trade.\\n\\nSection::::1988â95.\\n1988 saw the birth of the group M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy, in connection with a production request by Reinhard Piel (Head of A&R at ZYX Records) for a cover version of the Technotronic hit \"Pump up the Jam\". The following year the group signed a new label deal with ZYX Records and made further releases by M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy, for example the song \"Itâs on You\". They also created a number of other productions, some projects and remixes. Around 1992, the label had financial problems and O-Jay started to work part-time as a photographer again.\\n\\nIn 1993, M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy signed a new deal with the German BMG / Hansa label. The first single âAnother Nightâ was only a minor hit in Europe, barely making it into the Top 100 in several European countries. With the help of Vincent DeGiorgio, the song reached number one in Canada and the act was signed to Arista Records in the U.S. thanks to Arista Records CEO Clive Davis..\\n\\nWith the upcoming release of \"Another Night\" in the U.S., the decision was made to change the name M.C. Sar & The Real McCoy, simply into Real McCoy. The single \"Another Night\" reached number three on the U.S. \"Billboard\" Hot 100 Singles chart, where it had a 40-week run inside the Top 40. The single was certified Platinum (1,000,000 copies sold), and became the best-selling single by a German artist in the American market. \"Run Away,\" the follow-up single, entered the Top 40 of the Hot 100 Singles chart on 11 March 1995, eventually also reaching number three, and being certified Gold (500,000 copies sold) in the US and over 1,500,000 copies sold around the world. The album \"Another Night\" was released by Arista in the U.S. on 28 March 1995, and the group won several awards around the world. However, despite what some sources mention, there was no Grammy nomination involved.\\n\\nSection::::1999âpresent.\\nIn 1999, after the unexpected death of his father, Jeglitza focused on the production of other artists.

It used to be written with the characters æ´ç´ (lit. \"foreign zither\"), but over time the first character changed to æ (also pronounced \"yÃ¡ng\"), which means \"acclaimed\". It is also spelled yang quin or yang ch\\'in. Hammered dulcimers of various types are now very popular not only in China, but also Eastern Europe, the Middle East, India, Iran, and Pakistan. The instruments are also sometimes known by the names \"santur\" and \"cymbalom\". This instrument had an influence on the Thai classical instrument, known as Khim (à¸à¸´à¸¡). \\n\\nThe yangqin was traditionally fitted with bronze strings (though older Chinese stringed instruments used silk strings, resulting in their, and the yangqin\\'s, categorisation as a silk, or \"si\" instrument), which gave the instrument a soft timbre. This form of instrument is still occasionally heard today in the \"hudie qin\" (è´è¶ç´, lit. \"butterfly zither\") played in the traditional silk and bamboo genre from the Shanghai region known as Jiangnan sizhu (æ±åçµ²ç«¹), as well as in some Cantonese music groups. The Thai and Cambodian \"khim\" are nearly identical in their construction, having been introduced to those nations by southern Chinese musicians. Since the 1950s, however, steel alloy strings (in conjunction with copper-wound steel strings for the bass notes) have been used, in order to give the instrument a brighter, and louder tone. The modern yangqin can have as many as five courses of bridges and may be arranged chromatically. Traditional instruments, with three or more courses of bridges, are also still widely in use. The instrument\\'s strings are struck with two lightweight bamboo beaters (also known as hammers) with rubber tips. A professional musician often carries several sets of beaters, each of which draws a slightly different tone from the instrument, much like the drum sticks of Western percussionists. The yangqin is used both as a solo instrument and in picture\\n\\nSection::::Origins.\\nHistorians offer several theories to explain how the instrument was introduced to China:\\n\\nThe word \"yangqin\" has historically been written in two different ways, using different Chinese characters for \"yang\". The \"yang\" in the earlier version was written with the character æ´, meaning \"foreign.\" It was later changed, in 1910, to the character \"yang\" (æ), meaning \"acclaimed\".\\n\\nSection::::Theory of introduction by land.\\nAnother theory of how the yangqin came into contact with the Chinese is through the Silk Road from Mongolia. At a glance, the Silk Route stretches almost 5,000 miles reaching from China to the Middle East, including Iran (Persia). The Iranian santur, a dulcimer, has existed since ancient times. If any dulcimer was to influence China by land, it is likely to be this instrument.\\n\\nThe technical structure of the santur is different in the way the tuning pegs are place, the bridges and the mallets. The yangqin\\'s tuning pins are set in parallel instead of a 90-degree angle down at the side. The mallets of the santur also differ from those of the yangqin - they are made of wood with finger grip, designed to let the players perform by gripping the two mallets between their fore and middle fingers. Both modern and earlier yangqin mallets did not include finger grips.\\n\\nThe bridge of the yangqin consist of long, single pieces of wood with many protruding \"stubs\" supporting the strings unlike the santur, which uses a number of small, individual chesspiece-like bridges.\\n\\nSection::::Theory of introduction by sea.\\nThe port at Canton/Guangzhou attracts traders from all over Asia: from Japan, India, Southeast Asia, and the Middle East. The ships from this region bought back precious stones, slaves, exotic wares, fruits, spices, etc. Along with trade, businesses, ideas, philosophies and scientific knowledge were exchanged, including religion (principally Buddhism).\\n\\nDuring the 16th century, the Age of Exploration in Europe reached its climax and soon trade was established between China and Europe. Historians state that Portuguese, and later, English and Dutch ships, had brisk trade with China. Portuguese trading in Chinese waters began in the 16th century according to historians. Music historians report that the salterio, a hammered dulcimer, was played in Portugal, Spain, and Italy during this period. Historians say it is possible that the yangqin originated when the Portuguese, the English or the Dutch brought a dulcimer player to China who performed for locals.\\n\\nSection::::Construction.\\nAs the \"yangqin\" is a type of hammered dulcimer, it shares many elements of construction with other instruments in the hammered dulcimer family:\\n\\nSection::::Strings.\\nModern \"yangqin\" usually have 144 strings in total, with each pitch running in courses, with up to 5 strings per course, in order to boost the volume. The strings come in various thicknesses, and are tied at one end by screws, and at the other with tuning pegs. The pegs and screws are covered during playing by a hinged panel/board. This panel is opened up during tuning to access the tuning pegs.\\n\\nSection::::Bridges.\\nThere are usually four to five bridges on a \"yangqin\". From right to left, they are: bass bridge, \"right bridge\", tenor bridge, \"left bridge\", and the chromatic bridge. During playing, one is supposed to strike the strings on the left side of the bridges. However, the strings on the \"chromatic bridge\" are struck on the right, and strings on the \"left bridge\" can be struck on both sides of the bridge.\\n\\nSection::::Hammers.\\nThe hammers are made of flexible bamboo, and one end is half covered by rubber. Due to their unique construction, there are two ways to play: with the rubber side for a softer sound, and with the bamboo side for a crisper, more percussive sound. This technique, known as åç«¹ (fÇnzhÇ), is best utilized in the higher ranges of the yangqin. Additionally, the ends of the sticks can be used to pluck the strings, producing a sharp, clear sound. \"Glissandos\" can also be achieved in this way by running the ends of the sticks up or down the strings.\\n\\nFurthermore, some songs require the use of \"éé³ç´ç«¹\" (shuÄng yÄ«n qÃ­n zhÇ), literally \"double-note yangqin hammers\". These specially-constructed hammers have 2 striking surfaces, allowing the player to play up to 4 notes simultaneously (or even 8 notes, if the strings of the \"left bridge\" and \"tenor bridge\" are struck at a point where they intersect each other), resulting in a rich, powerful tone, which is especially pronounced in the lower registers due to the strings\\' long echoes. ææ²å¤å¥ (Lin Chong Flees In The Night), composed by é ç¥è¯ (Xiang Zu Hua), is a representative solo piece which utilizes éé³ç´ç«¹.\\n\\nWhen using éé³ç´ç«¹, the left hand holds a beater that plays intervals of a perfect fourth, while the right hand\\'s beater plays thirds. These intervals are standard over most of the yangqin\\'s range, due to the positioning of its strings.\\n\\nSection::::Cylindrical nuts.\\nOn both sides of the yangqin, aside from the tuning screws, are numerous cylindrical metal Nuts that can be moved for fine tuning the strings or to raise the strings slightly to eliminate unwanted vibrations that may occur. More modern designs also have moveable ball-shaped nuts that can be adjusted on the fly with the fingers; this provides some microtuning and additional dynamics during performances, such as\" portamentos\" and \"vibratos\" (see below: \"Manner of Performance\").\\n\\nSection::::Manner of Performance.\\nThe sticks are held, one in each hand, and hit the strings alternately. In the orchestra, the yangqin often adds to the harmony by playing chords or arpeggios. As the yangqin is softer than other Chinese instruments, it is usually positioned at the front of the orchestra, in the row just in front of the conductor. However, this is not a rule: the Singapore Chinese Orchestra positions the yangqin close to the percussion section. As the yangqin\\'s tones sustain long after they have been played, such an arrangement minimizies the dissonance that results. If the hands are free (e.g. in periods of rest), covering the strings with the hands quickly dampens the vibrations. The yangqin has been called the \"Chinese piano\" as it has an indispensable role in the accompaniment of Chinese string and wind instruments.\\n\\nThe yangqin\\'s solo repertoire calls for more techniques than is usually required in orchestral pieces. Examples include pressing down on the strings to produce \"vibrato\" effects, similar to that of a guzheng, as well as harmonics and é¡«ç«¹ (chÃ n zhÇ), which involves flicking the sticks lightly over the strings, causing them to vibrate, which results in a short, quick \"tremolo.\" Numerous other techniques, such as \"portamento\" - a glide from one note to another (accomplished through 2 methods, both involving the lengthening or shortening of strings: the first is by sliding the fine-tuning devices on the sides of the instrument by hand, and the second is by wearing a metallic \"ring\" - known as a æ»é³æå¥ [huÃ¡ yÄ«n zhÇ tÃ o] - and sliding it along the length of the indicated string) - are also used.\\n\\nSection::::Arrangement of pitches.\\nThe \"yangqin\" is a chromatic instrument with a range of slightly over four octaves. Middle C is located on the tenor bridge, third course from the bottom.\\n\\nThe pitches are arranged so that in general, moving one section away from the player\\'s body corresponds to a transposition of a whole tone upwards. Similarly, moving one section towards the left of the performer generally corresponds to a transposition of a perfect fifth upwards. These are only rules of thumb since the arrangement has to be modified towards the extremes of the pitch range to fill out notes in the chromatic scale. Such an arrangement facilitates transposition.\\n\\nIn the playing of traditional Chinese music, most Chinese \"yangqin\" players use a numerical notation system called \"jianpu\", rather than Western staff notation.\\n\\nSection::::Electric \"yangqin\".\\nThe \"yangqin\" has also been modified, much like an electric guitar, to be an amplified electronic instrument.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Yangqin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=734763'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '2QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7350122', 'text': \"Aliabad County\\n\\nAliabad County () is a county in Golestan Province, Iran.

He left India for Singapore at the age of seven. His father, Villayil Raman Gopala Pillai who wrote short stories and novels in Malayalam under the pen name of Njekkad had migrated to Singapore in 1947.\\nIn 1973 Chandran Nair married Ivy Goh Pek Kien.\\n\\nHe studied at Raffles Institution and University of Singapore from which he holds a Masters in Science (Marine Biology) and a Diploma in Fisheries (with distinction) but went into publishing on his graduation and worked as an international civil servant with UNESCO, first in Karachi (1981-1985), where he started painting, and then in Paris (1985 - 2004), where he now lives.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nNair started writing at an early age and his first poems were published in his school magazine The Rafflesian in 1963. His first book of poems, \"Once The Horsemen and Other Poems\", (University Education Press, Singapore), was published in 1972 and was well received as was his second collection \"After the Hard Hours, This Rain\",(Woodrose Publications, Singapore) (1975), and he has co-translated with Malcolm Koh Ho Ping \"The Poems and Lyrics of the last Lord Lee, the last Emperor of the Southern Tang Dynasty\", (Woodrose Publications, Singapore) (1975). He won The New Nation Singapore Short Story Writing contest in 1973 and has published his stories in \"Short Stories From Africa and Asia\" (which he co-edited with Theo Luzuka), \"Singapore Writing\", 1977, which he edited for the Society of Singapore Writers,\" Singapore Short Stories (Vol. 1)\" edited by Robert Yeo and also in translation in Malay in \"Cerpen Cerpen Asean\"(Dewan Bahasa dan Pustaka).\\nHe was founder President of the Society of Singapore Writers from 1976 to 1981.\\n\\nSince moving to the Paris he has continued painting and writing but has not published, though he has been included in a number of anthologies including \"Calling of the Kindred\" (Cambridge Universities Press, 1993), and has been featured in \"Reworlding\" :an anthology reviewing the writing of expatriate Indians, edited by Emmanuel S Nelson (Greenwood Press, New York, 1992). He is also included in \"Idea to Ideal\", FirstFruits, Singapore 2004 - 12 Singapore poets on the writing of their poems(edited by Felix Cheong) and in \"Journeys : An Anthology of Singapore Poetry\" edited by Edwin Thumboo, 1995.\\n\\nHis poem \"Grandfather\" has been used by the University of Cambridge International Examinations Board for their examination papers.\\n\\nNair is perhaps the only Singaporean poet cited in Parliament. In a discussion about the multiracial nature of modern Singapore, Dr Chiang Hai Ding (MP for Ulu Pandan) had this to say:\\n\\n\\nTo the east where there is sunshine <br>\\nThe Mind must turn for the beginning<br>\\nof the World, in which only love matters\\n\\nSection::::Reviews.\\nNair\\'s poetry has been commented upon by local as well as foreign reviewers. Below are some of these comments.\\n\\n\". . . But this is an important book of poems. Its themes are human ones, its scenes those we can recognize, its mythology ours. And Mr Nair handles it all adroitly. Many foreigners sneer at local poetry, talking of its lack of skill (as if that is the only thing that matters) and residing in the weather-beaten towers of Eliot, Yeats and Dylan Thomas. For them, I offer Mr Nair\\'s volume of poems. It should be interesting to see his future development. We have a strong and unafraid voice among us.\"\\n\\n\". . . of all the Indians writing in English in Singapore, it is Chandran Nair, I believe, who may be said to be the most \"Indian\" in terms of literary expression. His two collections of poetry, \"Once the Horsemen and other Poems (1972)\" and \"After the Hard Hours this Rain (1975)\", reveal fairly explicit references to Indian myths, legends, landscape and spirituality. In an early poem (Grandfather) written for his grandfather, Nair clearly registers the Indian nostalgia felt deeply in contemplation. The poem is suggestive also of the position Nair himself seems to have adopted in relation to living in an environment which does not always appreciate the commitment of becoming a sensitive soul.\"(Reworlding: The Literature of the Indian Diaspora, edited by Emmanuel S Nelson.)\\n\\n\". . . Chandran is no juggler of words. He dives to the existential core of an experience and describes it without ornamentation and verbal fat. The basic struggle of a psyche responding to the pressures of an intense search for a personality that is rooted in the presentâin one\\'s own presentâbristles in each line written by this promising poet.\\n\". . . Chandran Nair is obviously a master of words. His acuteness of observation and accuracy of detail when it comes to metaphorical allusions are admirable. Even if one is dissatisfied with his handling of themes, his handling of words distinguishes him as a skilled craftsman.\"\\n\". . . Chandran Nair\\'s poetry is goodâamazingly good. First, even from a purely sociological point of view, one sees through his imagery all the varied influences of this Malaysian/Singaporean Indian and watches as the influences struggle to form, not a \"Revolving Man\" but a real \"person\". One sees the background of Hinduism work side by side with Christianity, one watches the Chinese/Malay and \"other\" influences on his Indianness, from page to page and from poem to poem. It is very interesting readingâbut even more, it is so forcefully well-written.\"\\n\\n\". . . Much of Chandran Nair\\'s poetry is exploration. \"Once the Horsemen\" (1972) communicates the variety of Nair\\'s poetic world and the note of urgency with which he attempts his themes. Image and metaphor abound and are part and parcel of \"the wrestle with experience\". For the raid into the articulate to achieve what Shelley called \"new materials of knowledge\" amounts to an essential self-understanding to harmonise the ways to thought and feeling. By taking many themes as grist for his maw, Nair\\'s poetry ranges over the feelings of a Hindu bride to the Roman Emperor, Caligula. The simultaneous forays into life and language and the myths and legends of East and West, have strengthened and extended the coordinating power of Nair\\'s idiom.\"\\n\\n\". . . For those of us who remember Chandran Nair\\'s first book of poems (Once the Horsemen, 1972), impressed with its versatility and hard brilliance of style, a second offering of poems from any poet is another matter. . . we are worried about the poet\\'s development, we search for those unhealthy signs that indicate a falling into the cliched and routined. . . If we are inclined to such ungenerous thought, Chandran Nair\\'s new volume, \"After the Hard Hours this Rain\" sets our minds at ease. Our poet is as articulately tough as ever. . .\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Chandran Nair', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7352096'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '3AE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '735272', 'text': 'Elite Eight\\n\\nIn the NCAA Men\\'s Division I Basketball Championship or the NCAA Women\\'s Division I Basketball Championship, the \"Elite Eight\" are the final eight teams and, thus represent the regional finals, or national quarterfinals.

These come on land on several consecutive nights at certain phases of the moon between July and December to dig holes in the sand and lay their eggs. Park rangers are on hand to prevent the eggs being collected and sold locally for food. The incubation period is about 48 days and after that time, millions of juvenile turtles dig their way out of the nests and try to make their way down to the sea. Predatory birds engage in a feeding frenzy at this time, so to keep them safe, some of the eggs are transported to special nursery areas where the young turtles can be protected when they hatch.

The head is blue-grey and the main body is white speckled with blue-grey spots. The tail and fins show hints of yellow and there is a rainbow streak of color behind the eyes.\\n\\n\"Canthigaster valentini\" is omnivorous, it feeds on filamentous green and red algae, tunicates, and on smaller amounts of corals, bryozoans, polychaetes, echinoderms, mollusks, and brown and coralline red algae.\\n\\nValentinni\\'s sharpnose puffer is highly poisonous to eat.\\n\\n\"C. valentini\" are occasionally found in schools together with \"Paraluteres prionurus\", a non-toxic filefish which has evolved to mimic the very toxic \"C. valentini\" for protection against predators.\\n\\nSection::::Social Groupings.\\n\"C. valentini\" organize themselves into harems dominated by one mature territorial male and containing one or more territorial females. There may also be some immature individuals of either sex present in the dominant maleâs territory. Each female has her own respective domain within the territorial maleâs. Bachelor males, males who are sexually mature but do not inhabit a territory of their own with females, are either wanderers or live near another social group. These social groups, though male dominated, were found to be defined by the female fish living within the maleâs territory. Whenever a mature female dies or is in any way removed, the mature maleâs territory shrinks to include only the domains of the living females. When a male is removed, females remain territorial, though a bachelor male will most likely takeover any territory left undefended by a territorial male.\\n\\nSection::::Reproductive Behavior.\\n\"C. valentini\" are gonochoric, approximately half of the population being male and the other half being female, distinguishable by external characteristics. Dominant males breed exclusively with the females in their territory and maintain territorial boundaries. \"C.\" valentiniâs eggs are demersal, attached to algae on coral rubble. Females can lay anywhere between fifteen and over 800 eggs at a time every four to ten days depending on the season. Spawning generally occurs between 8:00AM and 3:30PM year-round. After eggs are laid, no parental care is required because eggs are unpalatable and, thus, reasonably safe from predation. It was found that predatory fish would rarely attempt to eat the eggs of \"C. valentini\" and when eggs were ingested they would be quickly egested. This allows females and males to maintain their territory without the necessity of protecting their eggs as well.\\n\\nSection::::Eggs and Larvae.\\n\"C. valentini\" eggs range in size between 0.68 and 0.72\\xa0mm in diameter, making them some of the smallest in the family Tetraodontidae. Eggs are spherical with nine radial layers, the outermost layer possessing strong adhesive properties. After incubating for between three and five days, a relatively long incubation period for tetraodontids, \"C. valentini\" hatch around sunset at which point larvae measure between 1.30 and 1.40\\xa0mm standard length. \"C.\" valenitiniâs most rapid growth occurs in the 24 hours after they are hatched. Growth rate then declines as fish get larger. Upon hatching, larvae begin a pelagic phase that lasts between 64 and 113 days. After settlement on reefs, \"C. valentini\" are considered juveniles, having a much more robust body shape.\\n\\nSection::::Toxicity.\\nThe toxin found in \"C.\" \"valentini\" as well as in other pufferfish species is one of the most potent naturally occurring toxins. It is a neurotoxin called tetrodotoxin present in the skin and other tissues of \"C. valentini\". It is lethal to many species of fish, thus making \"C. valentini\" unpalatable to predators. Threat of predation for adults as well as larvae and eggs is low due to unpalatability, causing reproductive behaviors to differ from other species according to the reduced predation risk. Their toxic skin makes \"C. valentini\" a model for Batesian mimicry, specifically by the filefish species \"Paraluetes prionurus\" which is similarly colored, allowing it to benefit from \"C. valentini\"âs low risk of predation\".\"\\n\\nSection::::Inflation Response.\\nBesides their toxicity, \"C. valentini\" have other mechanisms for evading predation. Pufferfish, as their name indicates, have the ability to âpuffâ themselves up in order to intimidate predators. This is accomplished by filling a distensible stomach with water through rapid gulping which can increase their size to three or four times their original volume. Pufferfish must be capable of maintaining inflation for up to ten minutes in order to outlast the attention span of their predators. It was once thought that pufferfish held their breath in order to display this behavior. A 2014 study, however, found that oxygen consumption actually increases while fish are inflated. It had been previously understood that respiration through the gills ceased during inflation while cutaneous respiration increased, but this study found that cutaneous respiration is nearly nonexistent, and oxygen intake through the gills is almost five times higher than normal while \"C. valentini\" is inflated.\\n\\n', 'title': \"Valentin's sharpnose puffer\", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7392626'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8gE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7393107', 'text': 'Keith Arbuthnot\\n\\nKeith Arbuthnot may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Keith Arbuthnot', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7393107'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8wE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7394197', 'text': 'Clan Irvine\\n\\nClan Irvine (also called Irving) is a Scottish clan.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Origins of the clan.\\nSometime between 1124 and 1125 Gilchrist, son of Erwini, witnessed a charter of the Lords of Galloway. The first lands by the name of Irvine were in Dumfriesshire. According to family tradition the origin of the clan chief\\'s family is connected with the early Celtic monarchs of Scotland. Duncan Irvine settled at Bonshaw. Duncan was the brother of Crinan, who claimed descent from the High Kings of Ireland, through the Abbots of Dunkeld. Crinan married a daughter of Malcolm II of Scotland and their son was Duncan I of Scotland.\\n\\nWilliam de Irwin was a neighbor of the Clan Bruce. The Irvines supported their powerful neighbors, the Bruces, and William de Irwin became the armor bearer and secretary to king Robert the Bruce. For twenty years of faithful service William de Irwin was granted the royal forest of Drum, in Aberdeenshire, as a reward. This then became the seat of the chief of Clan Irvine. There was already a tower at Drum which was built before the end of the 13th century as a royal hunting lodge. From this grew Drum Castle, seat of the chief.\\n\\nOrigin of the crest badge â \"Robert Bruce, who, when a fugitive from the court of Edward I., concealed himself in the house of William De Irwin (William Irvine), his secretary and sword-bearer. William De Irwin followed the changing fortunes of his royal master; was with him when he was routed at Methven ; shared his subsequent dangers ; and was one of the seven who were hidden with him in a copse of holly when his pursuers passed by. When Bruce came to his own again he made him Master of the Rolls, and ten years after the battle of Bannockburn, gave him in free barony the forest of Drum, near Aberdeen. He also permitted him to use his private badge of three holly leaves, with the motto, Sub sole sub umbra virens, which are still the arms of the Irving family.\"\\n\\nSection::::15th century and clan conflicts.\\nClan Irvine was often at feud with the neighbouring Clan Keith. Both clans invaded each other\\'s lands. In 1402, Clan Irvine is said to have slaughtered an invading war party of Clan Keith at the Battle of Drumoak.\\n\\nThe third Laird of Drum was Alexander Irvine, who was the first in a line of twelve Irvines who successively bore the name Alexander. He was said to be a knight of legendary prowess and followed the Earl of Mar to the wars in France. He later fought at the Battle of Harlaw in 1411, which was fought only twenty miles away from Drum itself. At Harlaw Alexander Irvine engaged in single combat with the famous \"Hector Maclean of the Battles\", chief of the Clan Maclean. Both are said to have died from wounds that they inflicted on each other. This is commemorated in a ballad about the battle as \"Gude Sir Alexander Irvine the much renounit Laird of Drum\".\\n\\nSection::::16th century and Anglo-Scottish Wars.\\nThe next Laird of Drum was a prominent figure in the negotiations to ransom James I of Scotland from the English and when the king was released de Irwyne was knighted. When the king was murdered in Perth, Sir Alexander Irvine took control of the city of Aberdeen to restore order.\\n\\nThe sixth Laird of Drum and chief of Clan Irvine was a peacemaker, and was rewarded by King James V of Scotland for his efforts to suppress rebels, thieves, reivers, sorcerers and murderers in 1527.\\n\\nDuring the Anglo-Scottish Wars the sixth Laird\\'s son was killed when the clan fought against the English at the Battle of Pinkie Cleugh in 1547.\\n\\nSection::::17th century and Civil War.\\nDuring the Civil War, the royalist Irvines supported Charles I. However the Irvines lived in a mainly Covenanter district and Drum Castle was therefore an obvious target. The castle was attacked when the Laird of Drum was absent by a strong force that surrounded it with artillery. Lady Irvine surrendered and the castle was then looted. The Laird of Drum\\'s two sons both fought in the civil war and were both captured. The younger son, Robert, died in the dungeons of Edinburgh Castle, however his brother, Alexander, was freed after James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose\\'s victory at the Battle of Kilsyth in 1645. Drum Castle was again attacked, ransacked, the ladies of the house were ejected and the estate was ruined.\\n\\nSection::::18th century and Jacobite risings.\\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1715, the fourteenth Laird of Drum supported the Jacobite cause and fought at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715 where he received a severe head wound. He never recovered from the wound and after years of illness died leaving no direct heir. The estate then passed to his uncle, John Irvine and then onto another kinsman, John Irvine of Crimond.\\n\\nDuring the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Clan Irvine continued their support for the Jacobite Stuarts and fought at the Battle of Culloden in 1746. The Laird of Drum escaped capture by hiding in a secret room at Drum Castle. He then lived for a few years in exile in France until he was allowed to return to his estates.\\n\\nSection::::19th and 20th centuries.\\nColonel John Irving of Bonshaw fought in the British Expedition to Abyssinia and his son, Sir Robert Irving of Bonshaw, was commodore of the Cunard Line and was captain of .\\n\\nThe twenty-second Laird of Drum fought in the Grenadier Guards during World War I.\\n\\nSection::::The clan today.\\nIn 2002 the Chief of Clan Irvine entered into a peace treaty with the 13th Earl of Kintore who is the Chief of Clan Keith at an elaborate ceremony on the banks of the River Dee to end their 600-year feud.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Clan Irvine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7394197'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '9AE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7394893', 'text': 'Erik Meyn\\n\\nErik Halfdan Meyn (born July 3, 1955) is a Norwegian journalist, former TV-host and TV-director.

It is topped with branches and often well decorated with autumnal, harvest or Judaic themes. The Book of Vayikra (Leviticus) describes it as a symbolic wilderness shelter, commemorating the time God provided for the Israelites in the wilderness they inhabited after they were freed from slavery in Egypt. It is common for Jews to eat, sleep and otherwise spend time in the \"sukkah\". In Judaism, Sukkot is considered a joyous occasion and is referred to in Hebrew as \"Yom Simchateinu\" (the day of our rejoicing) or \"Z\\'man Simchateinu\" (the time of our rejoicing), and the sukkah itself symbolizes the frailty and transience of life and its dependence on God.\\n\\nSection::::Associated activities.\\nThe halakha requires eating and traditionally sleeping in the sukkah. However, Jews are not expected to remain in the sukkah if they would be very uncomfortable there. For this reason, Jews living at northern latitudes will generally not sleep in the sukkah due to the low temperatures of autumn nights. Some Jews in these locales will spend some time in the sukkah eating and relaxing but go indoors to sleep.\\n\\nWhen rain falls on the sukkah, one is not required to stay inside. The Mishna in Sukkah 28b compares rain falling on a sukkah to a master who receives a drink from his servant and then throws it back in the servant\\'s face. The analogy is that through the rainfall, God is showing displeasure with the performance of the mitzvah by not allowing the Jews to fulfill their obligation of sitting in the sukkah.\\n\\nIn Israel and other temperate climates (such as Florida, Australia, Texas, and Southern California), observant Jews will often conduct all their eating, studying, and sleeping activities in the sukkah. Many Jews will not eat or drink anything outside the sukkah. Others will drink or eat fruit outside the sukkah.\\n\\nIn Israel, it is common practice for hotels, restaurants, snack shops, and outdoor tourist attractions (such as zoos) to provide a Kosher sukkah for customers to dine in.\\n\\nAll Lubavitcher Hasidim and some Belzer Hasidim (especially outside Israel) do not sleep in the sukkah due to its intrinsic holiness. Though the halakha doesn\\'t obligate one to eat or sleep in the \"sukkah\" if it is raining, Lubavitcher Hasidim will still eat there.\\n\\nA popular social activity which involves people visiting each other\\'s Sukkot has become known as \"Sukkah hopping\". Food is laid out so that participants will be able to recite the various required blessings.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nAccording to \"halakha\", a sukkah is a structure consisting of a roof made of organic material which has been disconnected from the ground for the purpose of the commandment (the s\\'chach). A sukkah must have three walls. It should be at least three feet tall, and be positioned so that all or part of its roof is open to the sky. (Only the part which is under the sky is kosher.) Most authorities require its floor area to be at least 16 square cubits.\\n\\nIn practice, the walls of a sukkah can be constructed from any material that will withstand a normally anticipated terrestrial wind. If the material is not rigid and therefore will sway in the wind, the sukkah is not kosher (Talmud, Sukkah 24b). Accordingly, there is a discussion among contemporary halakhic authorities whether canvas may be used for walls: Some, such as R. Ovadiah Yosef (Shu\"t Yechaveh Da\\'at 3:46) hold that even the slightest degree of swaying in the wind will disqualify the sukkah walls, and thus canvas cannot realistically be employed. Others, such as the Chazon Ish, permit motion to and fro of less than three handbreadths, thereby facilitating the usage of canvas walls which are anchored at all sides. The specific details of what constitutes a wall, the minimum and maximum wall heights, whether there can be spaces between the walls and the roof, and the exact material required for the \"s\\'chach\" (roofing) can be found in various exegetical texts.\\n\\nA sukkah can be built on the ground or on an open porch or balcony. Indeed, many observant Jews who design their home\\'s porch or deck will do so in a fashion that aligns with their sukkah-building needs. Portable sukkot made of a collapsible metal frame and cloth walls have recently become available for those who have little space, or for those who are traveling (in order to have a place to eat one\\'s meals).\\n\\nSection::::Roof covering.\\nThe roof covering, known as \"s\\'chach\" in Hebrew, must consist of something that grew from the earth but is currently disconnected from it. Palm leaves, bamboo sticks, pine branches, wood and the like can all be used for \"s\\'chach\", unless they were processed previously for a different use.\\n\\nThere must be enough \"s\\'chach\" that inside the sukkah there should be more shade than sun. However, there must be sufficient gaps between the pieces of \"s\\'chach\" so that rain could come through.\\n\\nSection::::Decorations.\\nMany people hang decorations such as streamers, shiny ornaments, and pictures from the interior walls and ceiling beams of a sukkah. Fresh, dried or plastic fruitâincluding etrogs and the seven species for which Israel is praised (wheat, barley, grapes, figs, pomegranates, olives and dates; see Deuteronomy 8:8)âare popular decorations.\\n\\nSome families also line the interior walls with white sheeting, in order to recall the \"Clouds of Glory\" that surrounded the Jewish nation during their wanderings in the desert. The Chabad custom is not to decorate the sukkah, as the sukkah itself is considered to be an object of beauty.\\n\\nOne turn-of-the-century Sabbath Observer decorated a Succah wall with his stack of \"Pink Slips\" that he had convinced multiple employers to give: \"one small favor\" (the timing approximates the beginning of this practice, 1910).\\n\\nSection::::Associated prayers.\\nSection::::Blessing.\\nAccording to Jewish law, one must recite the following blessing when using the sukkah. The blessing is normally recited after the blessing made on food, such as on bread or cake:\\n\\nTransliteration: \"\"\\n\\nTranslation: \"Blessed are You, L, our God, King of the universe, who has sanctified us with His commandments and commanded us to dwell in the sukkah.\"\\n\\nSection::::Ushpizin.\\nDuring the holiday, some Jews recite the \"ushpizin\" prayer which symbolizes the welcoming of seven \"exalted guests\" into the sukkah. These \"ushpizin\", or guests, represent the seven shepherds of Israel: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, Aaron, Joseph and David. According to tradition, each night a different guest enters the sukkah followed by the other six. Each of the \"ushpizin\" parallels the spiritual focus of the day on which they visit.\\n\\nIn Chabad tradition, an additional set of corresponding \"chasidic\" ushpizin enter the sukkah, beginning with the Baal Shem Tov and the Maggid of Mezeritch and continuing with the consecutive rebbes of the Chabad Hasidic dynasty.\\n\\nSection::::Notable examples.\\nSection::::Drive-through.\\nIn 2010, Bet Shira Congregation in Miami, Florida, erected a tent as a drive-through Sukkah, dubbed \"McBet Shira Sukkah\", in the parking lot of the synagogue.\\n\\nSection::::Sukkah City.\\nSukkah City was a public art and architecture competition planned for New York City\\'s Union Square Park. The winning design was chosen as the City Sukkah, to stand, starting on September 22, 2010, for the requisite seven days of the harvest holiday.

Two trains collided head-on while one track of a double track line was out of service for maintenance. Six people, including the drivers of both trains, were killed: two Luxembourgers and four French. Twenty more were injured in the accident, two seriously.\\n\\nSection::::Circumstances.\\nOne train was a Class 2200 double-decker passenger train of the Chemins de Fer Luxembourgeois (CFL), running on the MÃ©trolor service (TER Lorraine) from the city of Luxembourg to Nancy, France. The other was an SNCF freight train composed of 22 wagons on the BÃ¢le â Thionville â Bettembourg route. They were involved in a head-on collision. This type of accident, called (\"Nose to Nose\") in French railway jargon, is relatively rare and often fatal. One of the most fatal head-on collisions in France was the 1985 Flaujac train collision, which left 35 dead and 120 injured. The most recent accident of this kind happened on the Tende line on 27 January 2003 where a French and an Italian train collided, killing both drivers.\\n\\nThe accident occurred between the border stations of Hettange-Grande (France) and Bettembourg (Luxembourg), near the Lorraine area of Zoufftgen, on a double track section. The accident was on a section crossing a forest, limiting visibility. The speed limits of the trains were and .\\n\\nOnly a single track was being used because of engineering works. The line was electrified at 25 kV AC, and equipped, between Thionville and Bettembourg, with BAL (, \"automatic signal blocks\") and IPCS (, \"permanent counter-track installations\") which allow trains to run in one or other direction, the signalling and the interlocking being preconfigured to achieve this. Both trains were equipped with safety systems, KVB (, \"Speed control by beacons\") on the French side and Memor II+ on the Luxembourg side, which in particular halts the train if it passes a stop signal.\\n\\nSection::::Response.\\nThe prÃ©fecture of Moselle had made a \"White plan\" (an emergency plan) to organise the response. Hundreds of French and Luxembourger rescue workers were marshalled:\\n\\nThe \"Red plan\" was lifted two days after the accident, shortly after the sixth and last victim had been extricated.\\n\\nSection::::Investigations.\\nSection::::Preliminary.\\nAccording to the preliminary investigation, validated by the prefecture of the Department of Moselle and the Luxembourg authorities, the accident had caused:\\n\\nSection::::Inquiries.\\nThe accident being in both France and Luxembourg, judicial inquiries were opened by the authorities in both Thionville and Luxembourg. At the same time, other inquiries were started: in France, by the SNCF and the BEA-TT (, \"Land Transport Accident Investigation Bureau\") by the French Minister of Transport, and in Luxembourg, by the CFL and the (\"Inquiry Agency for Incidents and Accidents\"), in concert with the BEA-TT.\\n\\nOn 8 October 2007, the court of the Grand Duchy of Luxembourg indicted six CFL employees on charges of manslaughter and actual bodily harm. After investigation, indictments of two board members of the CFL were dropped. While no individual has been identified, it was stated that among the accused were two traffic controllers.\\n\\nSection::::Later.\\nAfter further investigations by SNCF and CFL, railway officials came to the conclusion that the fault lay with the Luxembourg rail traffic controllers who cleared the passenger train onto the same track as the freight train. Luxembourg\\'s Transport Minister Lucien Lux was quoted as saying \"It\\'s tough to say, but it\\'s the fault of the CFL.\"\\n\\nSection::::Analysis.\\nThe Luxembourger driver of TER 837\\xa0617 received an order to pass a red (stop) signal to enter the zone operated by freight train number 45\\xa0938, pulled by SNCF Class BB 37000 locomotive 37007 from the Thionville depot, which had entered the section as normal by passing a green signal.\\n\\nThe accident was due to a human signalling error on the Luxembourg side, according to information from the Luxembourg Minister of Transport on 15 October 2006.\\n\\nThe CFL accepted that the double-deck passenger train (Class 2200), travelling from Luxembourg to Nancy, had passed a red signal with the authorisation of the head signaller at Bettembourg. The signaller had not followed procedure in its entirety, and had not confirmed with the signal box at Thionville that the way was clear, probably not considering the possibility of another train having been delayed (in fact, the freight train). The Bettembourg signal box thus authorised the TER train to proceed on the track past a red signal which had already cleared the freight train from the opposite direction.\\n\\nHaving realised the mistake, the signaller at Bettembourg triggered an alert by RST (, \"Train Radio System\"), which was not received by the driver of the passenger train. He then wanted to cut the electricity supply for the line, but this was not possible because of the different rail electrification systems of the two countries; moreover the Luxembourg train had already passed to the French side, and so was beyond the signaller\\'s control.\\n\\nSection::::Crumple zones.\\nThe Class 2200 rolling stock was extremely new (2004) and had crumple zones that progressively collapsed in the event of overriding (locomotive BB 37007 going under the CFL locomotive).\\n\\nThe cab of locomotive BB 37007 was destroyed by the force of the collision, but the rest of the leading structure remained \"coherent\". The crumple zone had been compressed. The driver, stuck in the cab, had no escape. The trailing wagons left the track to the right (in the direction of the train) after their couplings failed.\\n\\nThe head motor car of the CFL train, built on the same assembly line as the SNCF train, had had its cabin crushed by the force of the collision and the roof was torn off by the overriding locomotive; however the intermediate trailing wagons and the tail motor car remained on the track, because the ends of each of the cars in between had anti-override structures which \"locked\" against each other in case of shock. These structures led to the high number of survivors.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Zoufftgen train collision', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7407565'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '-QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7408578', 'text': 'Bruce (ship)\\n\\nBruce was a 1,200-ton sailing ship built in 1866 by Aitken Mansell of Glasgow, Scotland.

As a young man, Mooney was a professional pianist. He attended Brooklyn and St. John\\'s Law Schools. After studying music under New York University professor Orville Mayhood and then under the influential Joseph Schillinger, he was invited to join the arrangers\\' roster for the popular Hal Kemp Orchestra, alongside John Scott Trotter (who was about to leave the band) and Lou Busch.\\n\\nMooney then moved to the Jimmy Dorsey Orchestra, but World War II was breaking out and soon he was called up by the United States Army.\\n\\nSection::::Hollywood.\\nOn his return from the war, Mooney became a freelance arranger in Hollywood and started to make a name for himself, providing charts for top vocalists such as Bing Crosby, Frank Sinatra, Judy Garland, Peggy Lee, Kay Starr, and Billy Eckstine.\\n\\nSection::::The Mercury years.\\nIn 1956, Mooney finally swapped freelancing for an exclusive contract, becoming in-house arranger and A&R Director at Mercury Records, where he would remain until the late 1960s. There, he provided arrangements for another raft of top singers, including Sarah Vaughan, Dinah Washington, Helen Merrill, Ernestine Anderson and, on Mercury\\'s parent label Philips Records, Nina Simone.\\n\\nMooney was described as a \"nuts and bolts arranger\" by fellow chart writer Billy May. It was meant as a compliment, and Mooney\\'s versatility can be characterised by some of the more notable arrangements he wrote at the Mercury stable. For Vaughan, he provided lush, string settings (along with more brassy, upbeat numbers) on albums such as \"Great Songs From Hit Shows\" (1956) and \"Sarah Vaughan Sings George Gershwin\" (1957). Though those arrangements grated with some jazz purists, their dramatic qualities inspired the acclaimed singer to some of her finest work, for example \"Hit Shows\" \"It Never Entered My Mind\" and the Gershwin album\\'s \"Isn\\'t It a Pity?\". Apart from such highbrow projects, Mooney also arranged some of Vaughan\\'s forays into R&B-inspired \\'50s pop, for example the Clyde Otis-penned \"Sweet Affection\" (1957).\\n\\nMooney\\'s numerous arrangements for Dinah Washington, meanwhile, ranged from straight big band swing, through Latin mambo to rhythm and blues, but the seven albums on which he worked with Simone, between 1964 and 1967, display the greatest versatility. Though they contain the occasional string-backed track not unlike Mooney\\'s classic work with Vaughan, they took him a world away from it at other times. For example, Simone\\'s final Philips album, \"High Priestess of Soul\" (1967), is a diverse combination of pop, jazz and gospel. Mooney\\'s two best-known arrangements for Simone, \"I Put A Spell On You\" and \"Feelin\\' Good\", might be quite different in some ways to his earlier work with Vaughan, but the same sense of drama is evident.\\n\\nIn his A&R capacity, Mooney helped to woo Xavier Cugat to Mercury, and he also produced several albums, including Dizzy Gillespie\\'s \"Jambo Caribe\" (1964) and Vaughan\\'s penultimate work for Mercury \"It\\'s a Man\\'s World\" (1967), for which Mooney also arranged some of the songs.\\n\\nSection::::As composer and recording artist.\\nMooney recorded numerous orchestral albums in his own name, such as \"Ballet With A Beat\" (1961), which fused famous ballet melodies such as \"Dance of the Sugar Plum Fairy\" and \"Sabre Dance\" with West Coast jazz, and the earlier \"Musical Horoscope\", for which Mooney composed a different tune for each of the signs of the zodiac.\\n\\nHaving joined ASCAP in 1936, Mooney\\'s compositions included \"Rigamarole\", \"Hodge-Podge\", \"Jumpin\\' Jiminy\", \"Sing, It\\'s Good For Ya\", and \"Goin\\' to Town\".\\n\\nSection::::The Universal years.\\nPhilips decided to phase out the Mercury label in the late 1960s and so Mooney moved on to Universal Studios, where he became musical director on many of the most popular TV shows of the 1970s, including \"Columbo\", \"Kojak\", \"Marcus Welby, M.D.\", \"Ellery Queen\", \"The Six Million Dollar Man\", \"The Bionic Woman\", \"\" and \"The Rockford Files\". His film work included the score to the Richard Burton war film \"Raid on Rommel\" (1971), as well as television movies such as \"The Longest Night\" (1972), \"Runaway!\" (1973), \"Sunshine\" (1973), \"A Case of Rape\" (1974) and \"The Execution of Private Slovik\" (1974).\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nHal Mooney retired after composing the musical score to the 1977 television series \"The Storyteller\".

It is a 32-bit implementation, and was in part a response to Digital Equipment Corporation\\'s (DEC) VAX computer. The project was headed by Jon L White, with a stated goal of maintaining compatibility with MacLisp while fixing many of its problems.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Lisp language was invented in 1958 by John McCarthy while he was at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT). From its inception, Lisp was closely connected with the artificial intelligence (AI) research community, especially on PDP-10 systems. The 36-bit word size of the PDP-6 and PDP-10 was influenced by the usefulness of having two Lisp 18-bit pointers in one word: \"The PDP-6 project started in early 1963, as a 24-bit machine. It grew to 36 bits for LISP, a design goal.\" Lisp was used as the implementation of the programming language Micro Planner that was the foundation for the famous AI system SHRDLU. Lisp, in particular Maclisp (so named because it originated at MIT\\'s project MAC) was also used to implement the Macsyma computer algebra system. In the 1970s, as AI research spawned commercial offshoots, the performance of extant Lisp systems became a growing problem.\\n\\nPartly because of garbage collection (Lisp would use stop-and-copy garbage collection of its single heap for memory allocation) and partly because of its representation of internal structures, Lisp became difficult to run on the memory-limited stock computer hardware of the day. This led to creating Lisp machines: dedicated hardware for running Lisp environments and programs. An alternative was to use the more powerful commodity hardware which was becoming available, especially the Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) VAX.\\n\\nNIL was an implementation of Lisp developed at MIT in the mid to late 1970s, and intended to be a modern successor to Maclisp that was able to run on stock hardware, in contrast to Lisp Machine Lisp for the Lisp machines. \"Originally designed as the first modern Lisp dialect on stock hardware after the development of Lisp machine Lisp at MIT, it went on to become one of the main influences on the design of Common Lisp.\" (pg 63/294 of ) Since the users of the Macsyma program represented a large potential user base for NIL, it was necessary that NIL would be a large, complex system, and that speed would be imperative. For example, high-speed bignums was a requirement to support Macsyma, since NIL would be a failure with slow bignums. Consequently, NIL ended up with a large base of VAX assembly language. These requirements led to a very aggressive and complex optimization strategy which was applied prematurely, with negative results on the final system.\\n\\nConcurrent with the effort to write NIL, a research group at Stanford University and Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory headed by Richard P. Gabriel were investigating the design of a Lisp to run on the S-1 Mark IIA supercomputer, S-1 Lisp. That Lisp was never fully functional, but was a test bed for implementing advanced compiler methods in a Lisp. Eventually the S-1 and NIL groups began collaborating.\\n\\nAlthough unsuccessful in meeting its goals as a used language, NIL was important in several ways. First, it brought together Jon L. White, Guy L. Steele Jr., and Richard P. Gabriel, who were later to define Common Lisp. Second, Jonathan Rees worked on part of the NIL project during a year away from Yale University. On returning to Yale, he was hired by the computer science department to write a new Lisp, which became the optimizing, native code Scheme system named T. In part, NIL begat this name, since \"T is not NIL\".\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'NIL (programming language)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7415350'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXbx6', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7416321', 'text': 'Q2 (Star Trek: Voyager)\\n\\n\"Q2\" is the 18th episode of the of the American science fiction television series \".\" It initially aired on the UPN network as the 165th episode of the Star Trek franchise overall, and was directed by \"\" castmember LeVar Burton (Geordi La Forge).\\n\\nThe series follows the adventures of the Federation starship \"Voyager\" during its journey home to Earth, having been stranded tens of thousands of light-years away. In this episode, Q (John de Lancie) stops by to leave his undisciplined son (Keegan de Lancie) (conceived at the end of \"The Q and the Grey\") in the care of his \"godmother\", Captain Janeway (Kate Mulgrew).\\n\\nThis episode marks the last on-screen appearance of \"Q\", and features \"Q\" actor John de Lancie\\'s real-life son Keegan as the young \"Q\".\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nQ (John de Lancie) shows up on USS \"Voyager\" to introduce Kathryn Janeway (Kate Mulgrew) to her godson, Q Junior (Keegan de Lancie), who now has the appearance of a human teenager. Q Junior is rambunctious and troublesome, causing various incidents across the ship. Q explains to Janeway that the Continuum hoped his son would help stabilize the Continuum but instead started the same type of problems on a much larger scale such as tearing holes in the fabric of space-time. The Continuum blamed Q and plans to turn Q Junior into an amoeba. Q brought him to \"Voyager\" to hopefully have Q Junior learn something. Janeway suggests some \"father-son\" time, but after ten minutes, Q admits that doesn\\'t help as Q Junior had just rearranged the tectonic plates on a nearby planet. Janeway asserts that Q Junior needs to learn there are consequences of his actions.\\n\\nBy order of the Continuum, Q strips Q Junior of his powers and departs. Q Junior still manages to cause trouble, but after a stern talking-to by Janeway, he improves his ways, even becoming friends with Icheb (Manu Intiraymi). When Q returns, he appears to have little interest in Q Junior\\'s progress before departing. Q Junior becomes depressed, and decides to take Icheb on a tour of the galaxy in the \"Delta Flyer\". They encounter a Chokuzan vessel that fires on them with a neural weapon that knocks Icheb unconscious. Q Junior races the \"Flyer\" back to \"Voyager\", and pleads with the Doctor (Robert Picardo) to help find a cure for his friend. The Doctor is unable to identify how to cure Icheb, and Q refuses to save the life of someone his son put in danger, hoping that would teach him a lesson. When Janeway hears of this, she takes Q Junior along to locate the Chokuzan ship, hoping to learn how to heal Icheb. When they reach the ship, the Chokuzans demand someone bear punishment for the responsibility of the previous encounter. Janeway attempts to take responsibility as the captain of the ship, but Q Junior asserts it was his fault. Suddenly, it is revealed that this was all a ploy by Q; the Chokuzan ship never existed, and Icheb is restored to full health.\\n\\nThey return to \"Voyager\" where Q stands trial to the Continuum. They decide that while Q Junior has shown some improvement, he will still be exiled from the Continuum and left as a human forever. Q angrily departs following this decision. He returns later and speaks to Janeway, explaining that he told the Continuum that if they exiled his son, he would leave it too, and because of his importance to the stability of the Continuum, they had no choice but to restore Q Junior\\'s powers, as long as Q took eternal custody of his son. Q Junior uses his powers to fill Janeway\\'s ready room with roses before leaving as a token of thanks. Q also shows his appreciation to Janeway by giving her information to help shave a few years on their return trip to Earth. Though thankful for that, Janeway asks why Q did not take them all the way home, to which he replies that he would be setting himself as a bad example for his son if he did all the work for her, before disappearing.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nThe episode was noted as tenth funniest episodes of the Star Trek franchise, by CBR in 2019.

He has played county cricket in England for the past ten years for five first-class teams Derbyshire, Leicestershire, Northamptonshire, Middlesex and Somerset.\\n\\nDespite being colour blind and short sighted, he maintained a first-class average of nearly 50, yet he did not play for the Australia national cricket team until the age of 30, when he was selected for a single Test match in 2008. He was recalled to the Australia national team for the 2013 Ashes series, aged 35, and over the following two years played a further 24 Tests opening the batting for Australia before retiring after the 2015 Ashes series.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn in St George, Sydney, Rogers\\' father, John Rogers played for New South Wales between 1969 and 1970. He is also a cousin of Australian chess grandmaster Ian Rogers.\\n\\nRogers made one Youth Test match appearance, against New Zealand in 1996. Rogers\\' batting talent had led some to anoint him as the next Australian opener, replacing Justin Langer.\\n\\nSection::::Domestic career.\\nHe first came to England in 1996 to play in the Devon Cricket League for North Devon CC under the watchful eye of former Gloucestershire player and Test match umpire David Shepherd. He came back the following year to score a league record aggregate of 1,273 runs but could not save the Instow Club from relegation.\\n\\nIn 2002 he played for Exeter, also in the Devon League, and in 2003 he returned to England once again to play for Wellington CC in the Shropshire League The welter of runs he contributed saw them move from the Furrow\\'s Shropshire League to the Birmingham League where they were again promoted. He was unable to play Minor Counties cricket but did make one appearance for Shropshire in the Nat West Trophy where overseas players were allowed, but made a duck in his only game.\\n\\nHe made his first trip into English First Class cricket playing for Derbyshire in 2004, where despite suffering from a shoulder injury, played well. He moved to Leicestershire in the second half of the 2005 season, where he averaged over 70, and scored one double-century against the touring Australians. In 2006 he moved to Northamptonshire and immediately made his mark with fifty fours, two sixes, and a final score of 319 from 417 balls against Gloucestershire.\\n\\nIn October 2006 he and Marcus North put on a record domestic third wicket partnership of 459, Western Australia v Victoria, at the WACA. Rogers\\' score of 279 was the second highest ever by a West Australian, behind the 355 not out that Geoff Marsh scored at the same ground in December 1989. On 5 February 2007 Rogers was awarded the \\'State Cricket Player of the Year\\' prize at the Allan Border Medal presentation.\\n\\nHe returned to Derbyshire for the 2008 season, playing as their overseas player when Mahela Jayawardene declared himself unavailable due to his commitments with Sri Lanka and the Indian Premier League, and has since become the temporary captain after the resignation of Rikki Clarke. Despite being both short-sighted and colourblind (a fact that was said to put him at a bigger disadvantage when using the pink ball for the first day-night test against New Zealand at the Adelaide Oval), Rogers has proven himself to be a sharp player both at and away from the crease. Rogers has also played for Shropshire, representing them during one match of the C&G Trophy.\\nIn 2008, he walked out on the Western Warriors, reportedly over his status as a fringe-player in the state\\'s one-day team, and joined Victoria for the 2008/2009 season. \\n\\nIn 2008, Rogers hit 248 not out, carrying his bat for Derbyshire against Warwickshire. The score is the third-highest single-innings total in a first-class match by a Derbyshire player, and the highest score for 62 years. The innings meant Rogers had registered a double century for all four first-class domestic teams that he had represented.\\n\\nIn 2010, after relinquishing the Derbyshire captaincy to Greg Smith, Rogers joined Middlesex for the 2011 season, and was appointed captain of the first-class County Championship side in 2014. \\n\\nIn 2016 he joined Somerset, being appointed captain of the Championship side on his arrival. Rogers retired from first-class cricket at the end of the 2016 season; in his final match for Somerset he made twin hundreds in their 325-run victory over Nottinghamshire. \\n\\nSection::::International career.\\nIn May 2007, Rogers was awarded his first national contract with Cricket Australia. On 13 January 2008, he was added to the Australia Test squad as a cover for the injured Matthew Hayden, who had torn a hamstring, and he made his Test debut in the third Test against India at the WACA Ground on 16 January, but the Baggy Green had to be replaced a day later because Rogers\\' cap was too small, and he unsuccessfully tried to make it bigger to alleviate headaches caused by fielding all day in the scorching heat. Australia were chasing a world-record 17th consecutive Test victory, but found the going difficult. Rogers scored four runs in the first innings of 212 and 15 in the second innings as Australia unsuccessfully chased a target of over 400. His national contract was subsequently terminated in April 2008. Rogers commented that he \"didn\\'t see it coming, I\\'ll have to accept it and try to get back in.\"\\n\\nOn 24 April 2013 and at age 35, Rogers was named in the 16-man Australian Test squad for the 2013 Ashes tour in England, more than five years after his previous Test. He opened the batting throughout the series, partnering initially with Shane Watson and later with David Warner, and made 367 runs at 40.77 for the series to be Australia\\'s third-highest scorer. Rogers scored his maiden Test century in the first innings of the fourth Test, in difficult seaming conditions at the Riverside International Cricket Ground, Durham.\\n\\nFollowing his success in England, Rogers held his place as an opening batsman for the next two years. In the return Ashes series in the 2013/14 summer, Rogers scored 463 runs at 46.30 to again be Australia\\'s third-highest scorer. He scored his second Test century, and his first on Australian soil, in Australia\\'s successful fourth-innings run-chase in the Boxing Day Test at the Melbourne Cricket Ground,<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 26â29 December 2013 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 â Australia v England\"></ref> and he backed that up with his third Test century in the second innings of the New Year\\'s Test at the Sydney Cricket Ground with a score of 119.<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 3â5 January 2014 - England tour of Australia, 2013/14 â Australia v England\"></ref> He then scored a rearguard century of 107 against South Africa in the second innings of the second Test in Port Elizabeth in February 2014,<ref name=\"ESPN Cricinfo - 20â23 February 2014 - Australia tour of South Africa, 2013/14 â South Africa v Australia\"></ref> which was his only score above 50 in the series where he averaged 30.16. A two-Test series in the UAE against Pakistan in late 2014 was the leanest of Rogers\\' career, managing only 88 runs at 22.00.\\n\\nRogers returned to form during the 2014/15 summer, scoring 417 runs at 52.12 in the four-Test home series against India. He failed to score a century in the series, but managed consecutive half-centuries over his last six innings. He toured with Australia in its 2015 tour of the West Indies, but missed both matches with concussion after being struck in the head during a net session.\\n\\nRogers returned from his concussion the following month for the 2015 Ashes series in England, which he had announced before the tour would be his last before retiring from international cricket. He extended his sequence of consecutive Test half-centuries to a record-equalling seven innings in the first Test at Cardiff, before being dismissed for ten in the second innings. He batted through the entire first day on his way to the highest score of his Test career (173) in the first innings of the second Test at Lord\\'s, and made an unbeaten 49 before retiring hurt in the second innings after suffering a dizzy spell. He finished the series with 480 runs at 60.00, the highest average across both teams, and was awarded Australian Player of the Series.\\n\\nDespite a relatively short career of 25 Tests, Rogers retired having gained admiration for his watchful, consistent batting at the top of the order; in particular, during the two Ashes series he played in England, he was one of Australia\\'s most consistent batsmen in the seaming and swinging conditions. For all but the first few Tests of his international career, he formed a successful opening partnership with David Warner, generally playing an anchoring role to Warner\\'s more aggressive style; in only 41 innings together, the pair shared nine century partnerships.\\n\\nRogers received a belated sendoff at the 2015 Boxing Day Test where he rode a lap of honour around the MCG and received a mushroom stand to rest his Baggy Green cap.\\n\\nSection::::Career best performances.\\n\"as of 23 August 2015\"\\n', 'title': 'Chris Rogers (cricketer)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7430512'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7431437', 'text': 'Magic: The Gathering formats\\n\\n\"Magic: The Gathering\" formats are various ways in which the \"\" collectible card game can be played. Each format provides rules for deck construction and gameplay, with many confining the pool of permitted cards to those released in a specified group of \"Magic\" . The DCI, the governing body that oversees official \"Magic\" competitive play, categorizes its tournament formats into Constructed and Limited. \\n\\nConstructed formats require decks to be made prior to participation, with players allowed to use any tournament-legal cards they possess. Sanctioned Constructed formats include Standard, Modern, Legacy, and Vintage. Limited formats, in contrast, utilize a restricted and unknown pool of cards, usually formed by opening \"Magic\" products. Limited competition require players to select cards and build decks on the fly within the tournament itself. The primary two sanctioned Limited formats are Sealed Deck and Booster Draft. \\n\\nA number of other formats have been designed by Wizards of the Coast or by players for custom gameplay or reduced investment cost; these are known as casual formats. Some casual formats utilize rules or sets of cards that differ from those used in sanctioned tournament play. \\n\\nSection::::Official formats.\\nThe term \"sanctioned\" refers to formats that the DCI allows to be run at official events. Many of the deck construction rules are shared across both sanctioned and casual formats. The following is a non-exhaustive summary of some of the major formats.\\n\\nSection::::Constructed.\\nConstructed formats, as opposed to Limited formats, allow players to build decks from the entirety of the legal cards available in the specified format. The formats differ based on the card pool allowed, which affects each format\\'s accessibility, power level, and complexity. In Constructed format tournaments, players build their deck in advance of the tournament. Of the constructed formats, the most popular are Standard, Modern, Legacy, Vintage, and Pauper.\\n\\nThe following rules apply to most sanctioned Constructed formats:\\n\\nSection::::Pauper.\\nPauper is a Magic variant in which card legality is based on printed rarity. In Pauper, only common cards are legal, or rather any card printed at common rarity, by deck construction rules. It is largely known as a \"Magic Online\" format, although paper Pauper events have been run using the MTGO legality list. It was added as an official format on \"Magic Online\" December 1, 2008. \\n\\nSection::::Standard.\\nThe Standard format is continually one of the most popular formats in the constructed deck tournament scene. It is the format most commonly found at Friday Night Magic tournaments, played weekly at many hobby shops. Standard\\'s former name was \"Type 2\". This format generally consists of the most recent three or four \"Block\" releases. The release of the first set of a new Block in Autumn (usually the first Friday in October) triggers a rotation; the new Block becomes Standard legal, and the oldest two blocks rotate out. (The previous rule was using two recent \"Block\" releases plus any core sets released between the older set of the block and the first set that would make that block rotated out). The current Standard set includes the \"Ixalan\" block, \"Dominaria\", \"Guilds of Ravnica\" and Core Set 2019. Additionally, cards appeared in \"Welcome Deck 2017\" and cards from \"Global Series: Jiang Yanggu & Mu Yanling\" (only applied to events inside People\\'s Republic of China) are also legal in current Standard.\\n\\nFor a list of which sets were legal in the past, or notable deck archetypes, see .\\n\\nSection::::Modern.\\nModern is a constructed format created by Wizards of the Coast in the Spring of 2011 as a response to the increasing popularity of the Legacy format which, although popular, proved difficult to access due to the high price of staple cards, as well as dissatisfaction with the Extended format of the time. Wizards of the Coast is unwilling to reprint some of these cards due to the Reserved List, a list of cards Wizards promised never to reprint in order to protect card prices. Therefore, Modern was designed as a new format that would exclude all cards on the Reserved List, allowing the format to be more accessible than Legacy.\\n\\nModern allows cards from all core sets beginning with the core set and all expansions printed afterwards. The core set was when Magic cards began to be printed in modern card frames, and this is where the name for the format is derived. Wizards believed this cutoff would have the advantage of giving a visual cue as to which cards are legal in the Modern format.\\n\\nThe format maintains its own banned list. Cards are banned on the basis of their power level, as in all constructed formats outside Vintage. The first official tournament to be held using the format was in September 2011. The first Grand Prix to use the format was Grand Prix Lincoln in February 2012.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nLegacy allows cards from all sets (known as an \"Eternal\" format). It maintains a ban list based on power level reasons. The format evolved from Type 1.5, which allowed cards from all sets and maintained a banned list corresponding to Vintage: all cards banned or restricted in the old Type 1 were banned in Type 1.5. The modern Legacy format began in 2004, as the DCI separated Legacy\\'s banned list from Vintage and banned many new cards to reduce the power level of the format.\\n\\nWizards has supported the format with Grand Prix events and the release of preconstructed Legacy decks on \"Magic Online\" in November 2010. The first Legacy was in 2005.\\n\\nSection::::Vintage.\\nThe Vintage format, formerly known as Type 1, is another Eternal constructed format. Vintage maintains a small banned list and a larger restricted list. Unlike in the other formats, the DCI does not ban cards in Vintage for power level reasons. Rather, cards banned in Vintage are those that either involve , manual dexterity (, ), or could hinder event rundown ( and Conspiracy cards). Cards that raise power level concerns are instead restricted to a maximum of one copy per deck. Vintage is currently the only format in which cards are restricted. Because of the expense in acquiring the old cards to play competitive Vintage, many Vintage tournaments are unsanctioned and permit players to use a certain number of proxy cards. These are treated as stand-ins of existing cards and are not normally permitted in tournaments sanctioned by the DCI.\\n\\nSection::::Limited.\\nLimited formats are so-called because they require players to build their decks from a more limited pool of cards than Constructed formats. Limited formats require players to open a specified number of \"Magic\" products, they then must work exclusively with the cards that came from that product. Due to the nature of Limited formats, players cannot build their decks in advance of the tournament and must build their deck within the tournament itself. There are currently three sanctioned Limited formats: Sealed Deck, Booster Draft, and Rochester Draft. Though the latter was no longer used in current competitive-level events.\\n\\nThe following rules apply to all current sanctioned Limited formats:\\n\\nSection::::Sealed Deck.\\nIn Sealed Deck tournaments, each player receives six booster packs to build a deck. Depending on which sets are to be used in a sealed deck event, the distribution of packs can vary greatly. For example, a \"Magic 2010\" sealed deck event consists of six \"Magic 2010\" boosters, but a sanctioned \"Shards of Alara\" block sealed deck event consists of two \"Shards of Alara\", two \"Conflux\", and two \"Alara Reborn\" booster packs.\\n\\nSection::::Booster Draft.\\nIn a booster draft, several players (usually eight) are seated around a table and each player is given three booster packs. Each player opens a pack, selects a card from it and passes the remaining cards to his or her left. Each player then selects one of the remaining cards from the pack that was just passed to him or her, and passes the remaining cards to the left again. This continues until all of the cards are depleted. The process is repeated with the second and third packs, except that the cards are passed to the right in the second pack. Players then build decks out of any cards that they selected during the drafting and add as many basic lands as they choose. Each deck built this way must have a minimum of 40 cards, including basic lands.\\n\\nSection::::Rochester Draft.\\nRochester Draft is a booster draft variant that was commonly used as a format in Pro Tour and Grand Prix. Although it is still a sanctioned format, it has not () been used as a Grand Prix/Pro Tour format since .\\n\\nThe format differs from traditional booster draft in that packs are opened one at a time and are laid out for each player to see. Players openly pick one card from the pack in turn. Once each player has picked a card from the booster pack, the draft order reverses so that the last player to draft a card from the pack takes the next draft pick and then passes the pack back the way it came. Once each player has opened a booster and followed this process, the final player to open a booster opens their next booster and the draft pick order is reversed. The process is repeated until each player has opened three booster packs each and all the cards in those packs have been drafted.\\n\\nSection::::Sanctioned Multiplayer.\\nTraditionally, Magic is a game that is played between two players, however, it is also possible to play with multiple players. Despite the existence of numerous multiplayer formats, Two-Headed Giant is currently the only multiplayer format that has been officially sanctioned by the DCI.\\n\\nSection::::Two-Headed Giant.\\nTwo-Headed Giant (2HG) is a team game where pairs of players share turns and life totals. Each player has their own separate deck and plays independently of their teammate, however, teammates share the goal of defeating the opposing team.\\n\\nThe Two-Headed Giant format can be used to play Constructed or Limited games. In Constructed Two-Head Giant, no cards can be used by both members of the team, except basic land cards.\\n\\nIn June 2005, rules for handling multiplayer games were added to the official rulebook, and \"Two-Headed Giant\" team play became the first multiplayer format to be sanctioned by the DCI. The first Two-Headed Giant was in 2007. The first and thus far only to be held under the Two-Headed Giant format was in 2007.\\n\\nOn June 8, 2018, Battlebond was release as the first Two-Headed Giant-focused booster set.\\n\\nSection::::Casual formats.\\nCasual play groups and even Wizards of the Coast have developed many alternative formats for playing the game. These formats are designed to accommodate larger numbers of players, to allow two or more players to work together as a team, or create specific requirements for deck construction. They are distinct from the officially sanctioned formats such as Legacy, Vintage, Modern, Standard, or Block Constructed, which are organized by the DCI and merely define the available card pool, but don\\'t change the rules.\\n\\nMany of these variants are popular in tournament play, though not all have support from Wizards of the Coast. Several casual formats have been implemented in \"\".\\n\\nSection::::Casual Constructed.\\nAs with sanctioned formats, most casual formats can be categorized into Constructed or Limited formats. Casual constructed formats include:\\n\\nSection::::Peasant.\\nWhile in Pauper only common cards are legal, in Peasant a deck may contain up to 5 uncommon cards and the rest must be common. Peasant Magic was created by Rob Baranowski who felt that players with limited access to cards should still have an opportunity for competitive play. Tournaments for this format have taken place at Gen Con since 2001. However, the original banned list is considered to be outdated and most tournaments are played by the rules of the largest active Peasant community.\\n\\nSection::::Frontier.\\nFrontier is a format developed by Japanese stores Hareruya and BigMagic in 2016. It is similar to Modern in its deck construction rules, but with a later start date; card sets are legal from \"Magic 2015\" onwards.\\n\\nSection::::Rainbow Stairwell.\\nIn the Rainbow Stairwell format, players make a 60 card deck utilizing six cards from each and colorless. These six cards must have a converted ranging from one to six, with each card taking up one of six slots. Rules differ on what is allowed for the 24 land slots, with the simplest rule being 4 of each type of basic land; others allow nonbasic lands, but only if the entire cycle is used.\\n\\nSection::::Singleton.\\nIn the Singleton format, players are allowed to use only one of each card instead of the usual limit of four. This variation is also known as \"Highlander\" (named after the catchphrase \"\"There can be only one\"\" of the movies), \"Legendary\" (in \"Magic\", before the Magic 2014 Core Set rule change, there could only be one of any legend card in the game), or \"Restricted\" (tournament formats with a restricted list insist that decks have no more than one of those cards) Magic. Some players of this format require that the decks have a minimum of 100 cards, ban sideboards, and institute a special rule for mulligans with hands having either too many or too few lands.\\n\\nSection::::Tribal Wars.\\nTribal Wars is a constructed casual format in which one-third of every deck must be of a single . Common tribes in Magic include elves, goblins, and merfolk. Certain cards are banned in the \"Magic Online\" variant of Tribal Wars that would be overly swingy against known enemy Tribal decks, such as or .\\n\\nSection::::Warband.\\nWarband is a casual constructed format in which decks (colloquially called \"warbands\") have a minimum size of 40 cards. Furthermore, Warband is a singleton format, and the main deck may only contain up to 3 rare/mythic cards (\"captains\") and up to 9 uncommon cards (\"lieutenants\"), in addition to any number of common cards. Warband can be played with any cardpool, but is primarily played with Standard or Legacy cardpools. Warband is intended to be inexpensive and accessible, whilst allowing for complex gameplay with large card sets.\\n\\nSection::::Vintage Artist Constructed.\\nVintage Artist Constructed is a casual constructed format in which every card in the deck must be illustrated by the same artist, including basic lands. Cards illustrated by more than 1 artist are allowed but one of the artists must be the one selected for the deck. Deck construction uses the Vintage card pool including banned and restricted lists.\\n\\nSection::::Casual Limited.\\nLimited casual formats include all the sanctioned formats as well.\\n\\nSection::::Cube Draft.\\nCube Draft is a booster draft variant in which the pool of cards is a predetermined set of cards chosen for the purpose of drafting them. The pool of cards is known as a Cube and usually contains a minimum of 360 cards to accommodate an eight-player booster draft. The cards used in a Cube are usually unique so that no card appears more than once in a draft. Typically, the card pool is an amalgamation of powerful cards from throughout the history of Magic, although the card pool can be whatever theme is desired.\\n\\nThe Cube Draft format has been sanctioned by \"Magic Online\" in 2012, albeit for limited time runs. Cube Draft was first used as a format at the .\\n\\nSection::::Live Booster Draft.\\nLive Booster Draft is a booster draft variant where players draft during the game rather than before. First, players draft their seven card starting hands, then the game begins. Anytime a player would draw, they draft a card instead. This format is more skill-testing than Mini Master, the only other format that converts packs to games at 1 pack per player.\\n\\nSection::::Live Booster Draft League.\\nLive Booster Draft League is a series of five matches, composed of three LBDs and two \\'Sealed\\' matches built from the cards drafted after the second and third LBDs. This format provides enormous play value, granting 3 single-game matches and 2 best-of-three matches for just 3 packs per player.\\n\\nSection::::Back Draft.\\nBack Draft is a draft variant where each player tries to build the worst deck possible, because each player gives another player that deck to play in the tournament. To avoid mana problems, players choose what lands to add in the deck after they are \"backdrafted\". Scoring is usually done where a player gains a point each time the deck they play with wins and each time the deck they built loses.\\n\\nSection::::Reject Rare Draft.\\nReject Rare Draft is a format in which each player donates 45 rare cards (the same number as in 3 regular boosters) and then drafts as normal. The rares are \"donated\", as everyone takes home the deck they draft and no attempt is made to return the rares to the original owners, as all the rares donated must be able to be categorized as an \"unplayable\" rare occasionally printed by MTG for any number of reasons. Hence \"reject rare draft\". This variant was developed at Neutral Ground, a gaming store owned by Brian David-Marshall, a columnist for Wizards and noted commentator in the Magic world.\\n\\nSection::::Type 4.\\nIn the Type 4 or Limited Infinity format, players randomly draft a 45 card deck from a large card pool (similar to a cube draft) without knowing the cards included in their deck. Players get infinite mana but are only allowed 1 spell per turn (1 each turn, their own and 1 during each opponent\\'s turn). A starting hand is 5 cards.\\n\\nSection::::Casual Multiplayer.\\nThe majority of multiplayer formats are casual formats, with Two-Headed Giant being the only multiplayer format to ever be sanctioned. Many formats can be adapted for multiple players, however, some formats are designed specifically for play with multiple players. Multiplayer formats include:\\n\\nSection::::Free-For-All.\\nThe simplest format is the free-for-all, where players sit in a circle and vie with those around them to be the final surviving player. Sometimes restrictions are added on who can be attacked in large free-for-alls - e.g. a player can only attack players sitting next to them.\\n\\nSection::::Star.\\nStar (also called \"Pentagram\", \"Five-Point\", \"Rainbow\", \"Five-Player Star\", and \"Color War\") is a variant that involves exactly five players each playing one of the colors of \"Magic\". Artifacts and colorless cards are usually allowed, but not off-color cards, including multi-color or hybrid mana cards. Players sit in color wheel order (White, Blue, Black, Red, Green) and try to defeat the two diametrically opposed \"enemy\" players. A player wins when both enemy colors are eliminated from the game. It is possible to have multiple winners in an allied victory if two players meet the victory condition at the same time. (Example: Blue and White share the win when Green and Black have already been eliminated and Red is the last player to be eliminated. In this example, White and Blue have both reached the victory condition simultaneously.)\\n\\nAlternative variants of \"Star\" are where each player plays more than one color. For example, in a game of Star with allied color pair decks, the White/Blue deck would win once both Red decks (White and Blue\\'s mutual enemy) were defeated - Red/Black and Red/Green.\\n\\nSection::::Assassin.\\nIn the Assassin format, players are randomly assigned \"targets\" to defeat. Assassins and targets are selected by picking out pairs of cards (such as two forests two mountains two plains etc.) According to the number of players. Each player is dealt one type of card which is placed face up next to player. The other cards are shuffled and dealt face down (this is their target). Each player may only attack the target assigned to them. Players score points for delivering the finishing blow to their assigned target as well as for being the last survivor. Defeating another player grants you their \"contract\", and thus a new target to attack. If a player is dealt their matching card, then they are considered rogue and may target any player.\\n\\nSection::::Emperor.\\nIn the Emperor format, two teams, each generally composed of three players, play to ensure their central player (the \"Emperor\") outlasts the other. A team wins the game when the opposing Emperor has been eliminated, it does not matter if that team has any other players left on the team. Teams can either be pre determined or randomly decided. After teams have been selected Emperors are decided in the same fashion. Range of influence is a standard rule enforced upon each emperor during a game. It is widely debated what a fair range of influence is and should be discussed before the match. (Example: An Emperor with a ROI of 1 can only cast spells and abilities as far as 1 player to his left or right. A ROI of 2 enables targeting of 2 players left or right. This effectively allows emperors to use harmful spells on non emperor enemy players) Another rule worth noting is all creatures gain a tap ability that reads \"Target Teammate gains control of this creature.\" Summoning sickness affects use of this rule. If a player leaves the game for any reason all of their permanents leave the game as well regardless of who controls them.\\n\\nSection::::Variant \"Magic: The Gathering\" products.\\nWizards of the Coast have released a number of official products creating new, or supporting existing, casual formats. Below is a list of the formats these products were created for.\\n\\nSection::::Vanguard.\\nThis variant was designed specifically for social play. Each player has a special card that affects the game. These cards change the players\\' starting life total and cards in hand, and have additional effects as well. Vanguard initially began with special oversized Vanguard cards, released as part of various promotions. Only four sets of avatar cards were made before the product was discontinued. The cards featured depicted major characters from the storyline of Magic, including Gerrard Capashen, Karn and Squee. A new version of Vanguard was eventually added to Magic Online, with a player\\'s avatar filling the role of the oversized physical cards. Players are given a standard set of avatars and can receive more as entry and high-finishing prizes in release events. New avatars are regularly added as new sets of Magic cards are released, each depicting a card from the set. The wider availability online, combined with occasional tournaments, has made online Vanguard more of a success than its physical predecessor.\\n\\nOne recent addition to the regular Vanguard format is Momir Basic, which involves the Momir Avatar, which allows a player to discard a land card to get a random creature into play. All Momir Basic Decks are constructed entirely of basic land.\\n\\nSection::::Planar Magic.\\nIn September 2009, Wizards of the Coast released the Planechase product. The product was designed to allow players to play the new casual \\'Planar Magic\\' format. The format can be played with two or more players. Each player requires a traditional \"Magic\" deck and a \\'planar deck\\' of plane cards, players also need a \\'planar die\\'. The first player turns over a plane card from the top of their planar deck and that card affects the game as specified on the card. The current plane card only changes when the specific symbol on the planar dice is rolled.\\nIn 2012, Wizards announced that they would be making a new set of Planechase game packs. They were released on June 1, 2012.\\n\\nSection::::Archenemy.\\nIn June 2010, Wizards of the Coast released the product. The product allowed players to play a new multiplayer casual format designed by Wizards of the Coast. The format is designed for four players with one player taking the role of the Archenemy and the other three players creating a team to play against the Archenemy.\\n\\nEach player plays with a traditional Magic deck, however, the Archenemy also possess a \\'scheme deck\\' of 20 oversized cards. During the of the Archenemy\\'s turn they turn over a card from their Scheme deck and use its effect. The effects of scheme cards are usually powerful to allow the Archenemy a greater chance of defeating their three opponents. The Archenemy starts at 40 life while all other players start at the traditional 20 life. The Archenemy also always takes the first turn and draws a card at the beginning of this turn. The Archenemy\\'s opponents share a turn, as in the Two-Headed Giant format, however they play individually and cannot share resources.\\n\\nThe Archenemy wins the game by defeating each member of the opposing team, whilst the opposing team wins if they defeat the Archenemy.\\n\\nSection::::Commander.\\nThe Commander format, also known as Elder Dragon Highlander (EDH), uses 100 card singleton decks (no duplicates except basic lands), a starting life total of 40, and features a \"Commander\" or \"General\". The Commander must be a legendary creature (with some exceptional cases, namely Planeswalkers with text that specifically states they can be your Commander), and all cards in the deck can only have mana symbols on them from the Commander\\'s colors. The Commander is not included in one\\'s library; it is visible to all players in the \"command\" zone and can be played as if it was in one\\'s hand. Whenever it would be put into a graveyard or exiled, the Commander\\'s owner may choose to put it back into the \"command\" zone instead. A Commander that is cast from the command zone costs an additional 2 generic mana for every other time that Commander has been cast from the command zone that game- this is referred to as \"Commander tax\" (for example, a 3 mana Commander would cost 3 mana the first time it is cast, 5 mana the 2nd time it is cast, 7 mana the 3rd time, etc). If a player takes 21 combat damage from any one commander, that player loses the game regardless of life total (a rule to bring games to an eventual halt and somewhat keep lifegain in check). The format has its own official banned list. Commander is usually a multiplayer format, although a special separate banned list exists for \"Duel Commander\" balanced for 1v1 matches on \"Magic Online\".\\n\\nThe format started as Elder Dragon Highlander and originally assumed that the five three-color Elder Dragons from the \"Legends\" set such as or were the only generals allowed. It proved one of the most popular variants of \"Magic\". Wizards of Coast decided to officially support the variant with the creation of the , preconstructed decks designed for playing the format that include both new cards and reprints. The first set of Commander decks were released in 2011, and decks are continuing to be released as of 2018.\\n\\nSection::::Brawl.\\nBrawl format is a variant format of the Commander developed by WotC staff Gerritt Turner. Which targeted at players who want to play commander but with a Standard Cardpool. Most rules are similar to commander, however, the deck size is 60 and any planeswalkers can also be a commander, life total is 25-30(depends on number of players) and the commander damage rule is not applied. The format used Standard-legal sets. It was supported by Magic Online quickly after its introduction.\\n\\nSection::::Captains.\\nCaptains format is a variant format of the Commander format developed by WotC. Most rules are similar to commander with the exception of a mana library and fewer card decks. \\nSection::::Other casual formats.\\nVarious alternative rules can be used to govern the construction of decks. Some of these variants have become so popular that unsanctioned tournaments have taken place at various Magic tournaments and gaming-oriented conventions such as Gen Con.\\nDice Roll Outcomes:\\nRoll 1: Discard a card (Skip your attack phase)\\nRoll 2: Skip your attack phase\\nRoll 3: Attack (if Able)\\nRoll 4: Attack (if Able)\\nRoll 5: Attack (if Able)\\nRoll 6: Draw a Loot Card (Then Attack)\\nLoot Decks are often pre-constructed (30 Cards Decks) to create different scenarios to change the state of the battlefield. Cards drawn from the Loot deck MUST be cast instantly and cannot be held. If a player rolls a dice and is able to attack, that player may NOT skip their attack phase.\\nPlayers must use 60 card decks.\\n\\nSection::::Retired formats.\\nSection::::Extended.\\nThe Extended format, formerly known as Type 1.x, was a format created in 1997 that contained more sets than Standard / Type II, but fewer sets than Vintage / Type 1. In 1997, it consisted of cards from \"The Dark\" and \"Revised\" and forward. By 2002, it changed to consist of the last six-to-eight years of sets, rotating every three years. In 2008, the format was changed to a flat last seven years regardless, with a rotation each year. In 2010, the format was changed again to consist of only the last four years of blocks and core sets. With each autumn set release, one year\\'s worth of sets rotate out of the format. Any additional sets released between rotations are automatically added to this format\\'s card pool. The new system was implemented to reduce the format\\'s card pool, with the intention that this would make the format more understandable and attractive to play. On July 22, 2013, Wizards of the Coast announced that the Extended format would be retired, with the final sanctioned events occurring on October 8, 2013.\\n\\nSection::::Block Constructed.\\nThe Block Constructed format uses only the cards from a single block of . \"Magic\" sets from to \"Khans of Tarkir\" have come in groups of three sets known as blocks. Block Constructed formats, and blocks themselves, usually take the name of the first set in the block. For example, the Ravnica Block Constructed format consists of \"\", \"Guildpact\", and \"Dissension\". Only cards that were printed in the sets in the appropriate block can be used in Block Constructed formats. The \"Lorwyn\" and \"Shadowmoor\" blocks were a minor exception, as they were two mini-blocks of two sets each that were combined to make the Lorwyn-Shadowmoor Block Constructed format.\\n\\nAfter 2015\\'s \"Battle for Zendikar\", blocks now consist of only two sets. Despite Wizards of the Coast still sanctioned Block Constructed event, no major events like Grand Prix or Pro Tour used that format since then, and has played the importance of the formats down. The format itself would be dropped in April 2018, when Block was no longer used in Standard sets.\\n\\nSection::::Prismatic.\\nIn Prismatic or 5-Color, players must build very large decks of at least 250 cards and accommodate a minimum number of cards of each color. This format was first developed by Kurt Hahn and several other players in the Milwaukee area in 1999â2000. 5-Color was managed by the 5CRC (5-Color Ruling Council), which while not affiliated with Wizards of the Coast or the DCI, organized tournaments, had its own list of banned and restricted cards, and had a world championship held at Gen Con. It also supported ante cards, an initial component of the rules for Magic that has since been deprecated. When \"Magic Online\" was under development, this format was requested by many users, and it was added as \"Prismatic\" with slight differences. An additional \"big deck\" mulligan was also standard online, allowing players to compensate for hands with too many or too few lands. However, the 5CRC eventually stopped sanctioning tournaments and changed leadership, and the \"Magic Online\" Prismatic format was discontinued due to lack of interest in 2015.\\n', 'title': 'Magic: The Gathering formats', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7431437'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7432664', 'text': 'Cushing, Minnesota\\n\\nCushing is an unincorporated community in Cushing Township, Morrison County, Minnesota, United States.

It was founded on January 25, 1816, by Saint EugÃ¨ne de Mazenod, a French priest born in Aix-en-Provence in the south of France on August 1, 1782. The congregation was given recognition by Pope Leo XII on February 17, 1826. The congregation is composed of priests and brothers usually living in community. Their traditional salutation is \"Laudetur Iesus Christus\" (\"Praised be Jesus Christ\"), to which the response is \"Et Maria Immaculata\" (\"And Mary Immaculate\"). In 2011, the congregation had approximately 4,400 members, including 580 in formation. In 2016, there were 3,924 members.\\n\\nSection::::History and charism.\\nThe Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate were founded in 1816 in Aix-en-Provence by Eugene de Mazenod. Born into the French minor nobility, his family were forced to flee to Italy during the French Revolution. There he experienced years of family instability, poverty, and danger. The family was forced to flee successively to Turin, Venice, Naples, and Palermo. Returning to France as a young man, he entered the Seminary of St. Sulpice and was ordained in 1811.\\n\\nOn January 25, 1816, Father Eugene de Mazenod and four companions came together to preach missions in ProvenÃ§al. The first members of this society were known as \"Missionaries of Provence\". They received the title of \"Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate\" and approbation as a congregation under simple vows in a Brief of Leo XII dated 17 February 1826.\\n\\nThe congregation was established to renew the Church in France after the French Revolution, primarily to(1) Revive the spirit of faith among rural and industrial populations by means of missions and retreats, in which devotion to the Sacred Heart and to Mary Immaculate is recommended as a supernatural means of regeneration. \"He hath sent me to preach the Gospel to the poor,\" has been adopted as the device of the congregation. (2) Care of young men\\'s societies, Catholic clubs. (3) Formation of clergy in seminaries.\\n\\nHowever, the work of the congregation soon developed and the charism of the Oblates is that theyare not specialised, except in facing urgent needs. ...It was enough for bishops to come to our Founder and say to him: \"I do not have anybody\" for him to act, re-examine his manpower, cut personnel here and there, and release 2 or 3 men for these new needs. And that continues today still. You see, it is a question of passion, of missionary concern.\\n\\nThe ancient sanctuary of St. Martin of Tours was re-excavated and revived by Oblate Fathers under Cardinal Guibert in 1862.\\n\\nSection::::Vows.\\nAs members of a religious congregation, the Missionaries Oblates of Mary Immaculate embrace the evangelical counsels, taking the three traditional religious vows of poverty, chastity and obedience. Poverty means that all possessions are held in common and that no member may accumulate wealth. Chastity, abstaining from sexual activity, is intended to make the religious totally available for religious service.\\n\\nSection::::Religious formation.\\nThe congregationâs Rule of 1853 makes a statement which still applies: \"Whoever wishes to become one of us must have an ardent desire for his own perfection, and be enflamed with the love for Our Lord Jesus Christ and his Church and a burning zeal for the salvation of souls.\"\\n\\nIn the initial stages, those interested in joining the congregation have several meetings with an OMI priest, usually with visits to a community. Young adults aged 18 and over meet regularly to share their experiences of God and what God may be calling them to become. During this time the members of the congregation share what it is like to be a priest or religious brother. Those who are enquiring about entering the congregation are strongly encouraged to attend Mass as often as possible, to read the Sacred Scriptures especially the Gospel accounts, and to regularly spend time in prayer in order to better discern their vocation.\\n\\nSection::::Postulancy/Pre-novitiate.\\nThis is a 2-4 year-long experience of living in an OMI community, sharing in many aspects of the life of the congregation. During this time the postulants participate in the prayer life of a community, share more deeply with others, and become involved in one or more of the congregationâs apostolates. Essentially, it is an extended period of discernment for the postulants and an opportunity for the congregation to assess the strengths of the candidates and possible areas requiring growth. For those straight out of high school it is possible, in some provinces, to begin working on an undergraduate degree.\\n\\nSection::::Novitiate.\\nNext follows the novitiate which is the time for preparing to take the vows of poverty, chastity, and obedience. The novitiate year is crucial, for it is then âthat the novices better understand their divine vocation and indeed one which is proper to the institute, experience the manner of living of the institute, and form their mind and heart in its spirit, and so that their intention and suitability are tested.â Thus, the novices are given the opportunity for longer periods of prayer and spiritual reading as well as silence in order to reflect on the vocation God is offering and nature of their response. The spiritual development of the novice is of particular focus, especially through spiritual direction. During the novitiate the history and Constitutions of the Congregation are studied in depth.\\n\\nA simple profession is made at the end of the novitiate and the person officially becomes a member of the Congregation for: âBy religious profession, members assume the observance of the three evangelical counsels by public vow, are consecrated to God through the ministry of the Church, and are incorporated into the institute with the rights and duties defined by law.â\\n\\nSection::::Post-novitiate/Scholasticate.\\nAfter the novitiate, the new members of the congregation continue their studies. In the Philippines this normally involves a 4-year theology degree, followed by a missionary year abroad, although a student may make a request to study at the Pontifical Gregorian University in Rome. In Canada, studies are undertaken at Saint Paul University in Ottawa, Ontario. Scholastics from four provinces in Southern Africa (Central, Lesotho, Natal, and Northern) study at the congregationâs scholasticate in the small town of Hilton in KwaZulu-Natal or at the international scholasticate in Rome.\\n\\nVows are renewed annually; after three years a member may request final vows. According to canon law, temporary vows may be renewed for a longer period but not exceeding nine years.\\n\\nSection::::Missions.\\nPope Pius XI (1857-1939) was so impressed by the courage of the Oblates that he referred to them as âspecialists in the most difficult missions of the Church.â Indeed, regarding their ministry the Oblates declare:We fulfill our task in healing the world by understanding its evolutionary character, by critically engaging its contemporary spirit, and by meeting its new needs in new ways.\\nWe seek out and immerse ourselves in the lives of the most abandoned in their many faces and voices, and struggle with those most affected by conflicts.\\nWith Gospel values we dialogue with peoples of different cultures, faiths, and religions, in the search for an integral transformation of society; we work with others to safeguard human dignity, nurture family, foster harmony, promote a culture of peace, and respond to the calls of justice and integrity of creation.\\n\\nThe Oblates work in parishes, Catholic schools, retreat centres, and among indigenous peoples, emphasizing issues of justice and peace. The Oblates are active on five continents. They maintain a presence at a number of Marian Shrines including Lourdes, Our Lady of Snows, in Belleville, Illinois, Notre-Dame de Pontmain, France, and in Loreto, Italy.\\n\\nIn the UK and Ireland the Oblates work through parishes and Centres of Mission in London, Edinburgh, Anglesey and Dublin.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Missionary Oblates of Mary Immaculate', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=743721', 'cat_id': '743721', 'cat_title': 'Animal_sportspeople_by_Canadian_province_or_territory', 'cat_pages': '1', 'cat_subcats': '1', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'DQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7440911', 'text': 'Oddernes\\n\\nOddernes is a borough in the municipality of Kristiansand in Vest-Agder county, Norway. The borough covers eastern Kristiansand on the east side of the Topdalsfjorden and the Varodd Bridge. The borough includes the former municipalities of Randesund and Tveit. There was a municipality of Oddernes from 1838 until 1965, but its boundaries were very different from those of the present-day borough.\\n\\nSection::::Name.\\nThe borough (originally the parish) is named after the old \"OddernÃ¦s\" farm (Old Norse: \"Otruness\").

This part of Randesund consisst of typical Norwegian neighborhoods, but with a bit larger houses and has been criticized as an upper-middle-class neighborhood, especially Dvergsnes. Aside from the suburban areas in TÃ¸mmerstÃ¸, Randesund is mostly agricultural as one approaches Lillesand. Randesund has 2,000 people, of whom 7% come from a non-Norwegian background, the lowest percentagein Kristiansand and second to last on the list of most populated immigrant places in Kristiansand after Gimlekollen and before FlekkerÃ¸y.\\n\\nSÃ¸m mostly consists of neighborhoods from the 1970s. SÃ¸m only has 10% non-Norwegian citizens and is one of the areas in Kristiansand with the lowest lowest percentage of immigrants, despite being the most populated part of Oddernes with 9,000 people. SÃ¸m is a typical urban neighborhood of a city.\\n\\nHÃ¥nes also mostly consist of neighborhoods. Some of Norway\\'s most expensive properties were sold on HÃ¥nestangen. Other than that, HÃ¥nes has a wide range of apartment buildings and typical Norwegian neighborhoods. HÃ¥nes has a population of 4,000 of whom 18% come from a non-Norwegian background, meaning HÃ¥nes is the place in Oddernes with most immigrants, and the sixth most popular place for immigrants in Kristiansand after Tinnheia.\\n\\nTveit is the largest part of the borough by area, but it also has the smallest population of only about 1,000 people. Tveit is home to most of the farms in Kristiansand and only a few residential neighborhoods like Hamresanden, Brattvollsheia, and Solsletta.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Oddernes', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7440911'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'DgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7442421', 'text': '3204 Lindgren\\n\\n3204 Lindgren, provisional designation , is a carbonaceous background asteroid from the outer regions of the asteroid belt, approximately in diameter.

Organized broadcasting began in the U.S. in the early 1920s on the AM band â FM and television did not exist yet. Initially most broadcasting stations were assigned three-letter calls; however, a switch was made in April 1922 to primarily four-letter calls, after the number of stations had increased into the hundreds. For a few years thereafter a small number of new three-letter calls continued to be issued. Although most of the original three-letter calls were randomly assigned, these later calls were often specially requested to match station slogans. The last new three-letter call was assigned to station WIS (now WVOC) in Columbia, South Carolina on January 23, 1930. Since then, three-letter calls have only been assigned to stations, including FM and TV, which are historically related to an AM station that was originally issued that call sign.\\n\\nThis review only includes FCC-licensed stations. Not included are unlicensed operations, such as carrier current, cable TV, and Internet stations â for example, San Diego State University\\'s \"KCR\" â which have adopted call-letter-like identifiers that are not officially issued by the FCC. Also not included are stations which use, as slogans, three-letter truncations of their official four-letter call signs; for example, the full call sign for radio station \"KOH\" in Reno, Nevada is actually KKOH. In addition, stations which formerly had three letters but have since changed (such as Albuquerque, New Mexico\\'s KKOB, formerly KOB) are not listed.\\n\\nAs of March 1, 2019, there are a total of 102 AM, FM and TV stations in the United States that are assigned three-letter call signs. This is divided between only 68 different three-letter calls, because in many cases the same call sign is used by more than one station, although a given call sign is never assigned to more than one AM, FM or TV station. These 68 different three-letter call signs are currently grouped as follows:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Assignments.\\nListed below are all the assignments as of March 1, 2019:\\n\\nSection::::FM radio (27 stations).\\nIn cases where an AM station exists with the same \"base\" call letters as an FM station, the FM station is required to include an \"-FM\" suffix as part of its call sign. If no AM station is currently using the same base call sign, then the \"-FM\" suffix is optional.\\nSection::::Television (21 stations).\\nAs with FM stations, if an AM station currently exists with the same \"base\" call, a TV station must include a suffix to differentiate itself, but this suffix is optional if no AM station currently exists. TV stations may select either \"-TV\" or \"-DT\" as their suffix.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'List of three-letter broadcast callsigns in the United States', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=744379', 'cat_id': '744379', 'cat_title': 'R.E.M._video_albums', 'cat_pages': '16', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7445309', 'text': 'Cox Sports\\n\\nCox Sports was a regional sports network that served the United States New England region until 2012.

The college offers undergraduate and graduate degrees and comprises five schools: the School of Business and Technology, the School of Health Sciences, the School of Liberal Arts, the School of Nursing, and the School of Public Service.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nExcelsior College was founded in 1971 by the New York State Board of Regents as its external degree program, known as The Regents External Degree Program (REX). The initial development of the program was funded by major grants from the Ford Foundation and the Carnegie Corporation. Known as Regents College from 1984 until 1998, it operated as a program of the Board of Regents (which also served as its board of trustees). In April 1998, the Board of Regents granted the school an absolute charter to operate as a private, nonprofit, independent institution. On January 1, 2001, Regents College, required to change its name under the terms of the separation, became Excelsior College (\"Excelsior\" means \"ever upward\" in Latin; it is also the motto of New York).\\n\\nExcelsior College has more than 36,000 students enrolled in a wide variety of undergraduate and graduate degree programs.\\n\\nSection::::Accreditation.\\nThe college is regionally accredited by the Commission on Higher Education of the Middle States Association of Colleges and Schools. Its nursing programs are accredited by the Accreditation Commission for Education in Nursing, Inc. (ACEN), formerly known as the National League for Nursing Accrediting Commission. The School of Nursing has twice been designated a Center of Excellence in Nursing Education by the National League for Nursing. Its baccalaureate degree programs in electrical engineering technology and nuclear engineering technology are accredited by the Technology Accreditation Commission of ABET, Inc.The bachelor\\'s degree programs in accounting (NYS CPA Track) and business are accredited by the International Assembly for Collegiate Business Education (IACBE). The Master of Arts in Liberal Studies program has been accepted into full membership by the Association of Graduate Liberal Studies Programs (AGLSP).\\n\\nSection::::Academics.\\nExcelsior College is exceptionally liberal in accepting transfer credit from other institutions. Essentially, any credit from a regionally accredited institution will be accepted, if the course(s) falls within one of Excelsior\\'s degree programs. In fact Excelsior, then Regents College, was founded in part precisely to address this question (the non-transferability of credit, leading to uncompleted degrees). The college has recently added time limits: transfer credit will not be accepted if it is more than 5, 7, 10, or 20 years (depending on the specific degree program) prior to the date of enrollment. Even with these restrictions, this is a more liberal policy than most other colleges.\\n\\nExcelsior College is well known for its flexible, non-resident degree programs.\\n\\nSources of college credit that can be used towards an Excelsior College degree program, and to which advisors will refer an Excelsior student, include Excelsior College distance learning courses, courses from other regionally accredited institutions, college-level subject-matter examinations (including CLEP exams, and DSST/DANTES exams), non-collegiate training (including corporate, governmental, and military training) that has been evaluated for college-level credit by the American Council on Education (ACE), and assessments of prior learning portfolios. Unlike most colleges, Excelsior College sets no limitations on the amount of allowable transfer credit.\\n\\nExcelsior College also offers Excelsior College Examinations (ECE) which are comparable to CLEP and DSST exams and are accepted as a source of credits by many colleges in the United States.\\n\\nExcelsior College is a member of the Servicemembers Opportunity Colleges (SOC) Consortium of the American Association of State Colleges and Universities. SOC institutions are dedicated to helping servicemembers and their families earn college degrees. Military students can take courses in their off-duty hours at or near military installations in the United States, overseas, and on navy ships. Additionally, Excelsior College has repeatedly been nominated as a top military-friendly school by multiple organizations.\\n\\nExcelsior College is one of several regionally accredited colleges operating on a model similar to Thomas Edison State College in New Jersey and Charter Oak State College in Connecticut.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Excelsior College', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=745187', 'cat_id': '745187', 'cat_title': 'ACC_articles_by_quality', 'cat_pages': '22', 'cat_subcats': '20', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7451913', 'text': \"Mineral redox buffer\\n\\nIn geology, a redox buffer is an assemblage of minerals or compounds that constrains oxygen fugacity as a function of temperature. Knowledge of the redox conditions (or equivalently, oxygen fugacities) at which a rock forms and evolves can be important for interpreting the rock history. Iron, sulfur, and manganese are three of the relatively abundant elements in the Earth's crust that occur in more than one oxidation state. For instance, iron, the fourth most abundant element in the crust, exists as native iron, ferrous iron (Fe), and ferric iron (Fe). The redox state of a rock affects the relative proportions of the oxidation states of these elements and hence may determine both the minerals present and their compositions. If a rock contains pure minerals that constitute a redox buffer, then the oxygen fugacity of equilibration is defined by one of the curves in the accompanying fugacity-temperature diagram. For other rocks with suitable minerals, oxygen fugacities can be calculated, and the redox conditions can be obtained by comparison to the fugacity-temperature diagram.\\n\\nSection::::Common redox buffers and mineralogy.\\nCommon redox buffers\\n\\nRedox buffers were developed in part to control oxygen fugacities in laboratory experiments to investigate mineral stabilities and rock histories. Each of the curves plotted in the fugacity-temperature diagram is for an oxidation reaction occurring in a buffer. These redox buffers are listed here in order of decreasing oxygen fugacity at a given temperatureâin other words, from more oxidizing to more reducing conditions in the plotted temperature range. As long as all the pure minerals (or compounds) are present in a buffer assemblage, the oxidizing conditions are fixed on the curve for that buffer. Pressure has only a minor influence on these buffer curves for conditions in the Earth's crust.\\n\\nMH magnetite-hematite\\n\\n4 FeO + O = 6 FeO\\n\\nNiNiO nickel-nickel oxide\\n\\n2 Ni + O = 2 NiO\\n\\nFMQ fayalite-magnetite-quartz\\n\\n3 FeSiO + O = 2 FeO + 3 SiO\\n\\nWM wustite-magnetite\\n\\n3 FeO + O ~ FeO\\n\\nIW iron-wustite\\n\\n2(1-x) Fe + O = 2 FeO\\n\\nQIF quartz-iron-fayalite\\n\\n2 Fe + SiO + O = FeSiO\\n\\nSection::::Minerals, rock types, and characteristic buffers.\\nSection::::Mineralogy and correlations with redox buffer.\\nThe ratio of Fe to Fe within a rock determines, in part, the silicate mineral and oxide mineral assemblage of the rock. Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. For instance, at redox conditions more oxidizing than the MH (magnetite-hematite) buffer, at least much of the iron is likely to be present as Fe and hematite is a likely mineral in iron-bearing rocks. Iron may only enter minerals such as olivine if it is present as Fe; Fe cannot enter the lattice of fayalite olivine. Elements in olivine such as magnesium, however, stabilize olivine containing Fe to conditions more oxidizing than those required for fayalite stability. Solid solution between magnetite and the titanium-bearing endmember, ulvospinel, enlarges the stability field of magnetite. Likewise, at conditions more reducing than the IW (iron-wustite) buffer, minerals such as pyroxene can still contain Fe. The redox buffers therefore are only approximate guides to the proportions of Fe and Fe in minerals and rocks.\\n\\nSection::::Igneous rocks.\\nTerrestrial igneous rocks commonly record crystallization at oxygen fugacities more oxidizing than the WM (wÃ¼stite-magnetite) buffer and more reduced than a log unit or so above the nickel-nickel oxide (NiNiO) buffer. Their oxidizing conditions thus are not far from those of the FMQ (fayalite-magnetite-quartz) redox buffer. Nonetheless, there are systematic differences that correlate with tectonic setting. Igneous rock emplaced and erupted in island arcs typically record oxygen fugacities 1 or more log units more oxidizing than those of the NiNiO buffer. In contrast, basalt and gabbro in non-arc settings typically record oxygen fugacities from about those of the FMQ buffer to a log unit or so more reducing than that buffer.\\n\\nSection::::Sedimentary rocks.\\nOxidizing conditions are common in some environments of deposition and diagenesis of sedimentary rocks. The fugacity of oxygen at the MH buffer (magnetite-hematite) is only about 10 at 25\\xa0Â°C, but it is about 0.2 atmospheres in the Earth's atmosphere, so some sedimentary environments are far more oxidizing than those in magmas. Other sedimentary environments, such as the environments for formation of black shale, are relatively reducing.\\n\\nSection::::Metamorphic rocks.\\nOxygen fugacities during metamorphism extend to higher values than those in magmatic environments, because of the more oxidizing compositions inherited from some sedimentary rocks. Nearly pure hematite is present in some metamorphosed banded iron formations. In contrast, native nickel-iron is present in some serpentinites.\\n\\nSection::::Extraterrestrial rocks.\\nWithin meteorites, the iron-wÃ¼stite redox buffer may be more appropriate for describing the oxygen fugacity of these extraterrestrial systems.\\n\\nSection::::Redox effects and sulfur.\\nSulfide minerals such as pyrite (FeS) and pyrrhotite (FeS) occur in many ore deposits. Pyrite and its polymorph marcasite also are important in many coal deposits and shales. These sulfide minerals form in environments more reducing than that of the Earth's surface. When in contact with oxidizing surface waters, sulfides react: sulfate (SO) forms, and the water becomes acidic and charged with a variety of elements, some potentially toxic. Consequences can be environmentally harmful, as discussed in the entry for acid mine drainage.\\n\\nSulfur oxidation to sulfate or sulfur dioxide also is important in generating sulfur-rich volcanic eruptions, like those of Pinatubo in 1991 and El Chichon in 1982. These eruptions contributed unusually large quantities of sulfur dioxide to the Earth's atmosphere, with consequent effects on atmospheric quality and on climate. The magmas were unusually oxidizing, almost two log units more so than the NiNiO buffer. The calcium sulfate, anhydrite, was present as phenocrysts in the erupted tephra. In contrast, sulfides contain most of the sulfur in magmas more reducing than the FMQ buffer.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Mineral redox buffer', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7451913'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7455522', 'text': 'Klobuchar\\n\\nKlobuchar may refer to:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Klobuchar', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7455522'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7455840', 'text': 'Benjamin Franklin Perry\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin Perry (November 20, 1805December 3, 1886) was the 72nd Governor of South Carolina, appointed by U.S. President Andrew Johnson in 1865 after the end of the American Civil War.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nPerry was born in Pickens District and educated at preparatory schools in Asheville, North Carolina. He was admitted to the South Carolina bar in 1827, but pursued journalism and became the editor of the \"Greenville Mountaineer\" in 1832. The paper was adamantly against nullification and Perry was able to parlay his influence by being elected as a delegate to both the Union Convention and the Nullification Convention. Turner Bynum, who was editor of the pro-Calhoun \"Greenville Sentinel\" newspaper, met Perry in a duel. The duel was staged on an island in the Tugaloo River near Hatton\\'s Ford on August 17, 1832. Perry fatally wounded Bynum who died that night.\\n\\nSection::::Political career.\\nIn 1836, Perry was elected to the South Carolina House of Representatives and served for six years until 1842, he had lost to Warren R. Davis in 1834. He gained election to the South Carolina Senate in 1844, but returned to the House of Representatives in 1849 and remained a member until 1860. As the secession movement was sweeping the state in the years prior to the Civil War, Perry founded \"The Southern Patriot\" in 1851 to counter and spread a unionist message. Even though Perry was adamantly against secession, he embraced the state when it did secede and rallied the residents in the Upstate in favor of the Confederate cause. He was again elected to the House of Representatives in 1862 and served until being appointed as a Confederate States District Judge in 1864.\\n\\nOn June 30, 1865, U.S. President Andrew Johnson appointed Perry as the provisional Governor of South Carolina, because of the strong unionist views he had held prior to the war. Perry was directed by the president to enroll voters and to lead the state in the writing of a new state constitution. The delegates at the constitutional convention largely followed Perry\\'s guidelines for the constitution, but they strayed by adopting the black codes to prevent black suffrage. President Johnson, as well as several leading statesmen of South Carolina, urged the granting of suffrage to blacks while also including a property qualification clause. A property qualification would essentially disenfranchise all blacks without giving the appearance of impropriety towards blacks and prevent the imposition of harsh terms by the Radical Republicans\\n\\nBenjamin Franklin Perry said in 1865, \"The African,\" \"has been in all ages, a savage or a slave. God created him inferior to the white man in form, color, and intellect, and no legislation or culture can make him his equal... His hair, his form and features will not compete with the caucasian race, and it is in vain to think of elevating him to the dignity of the white man. God created differences between the two races, and nothing can make him equal\".\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nUpon the completion of the constitution, elections were called and Perry sought election to the U.S. Senate. He was elected along with John Lawrence Manning, but the Radical Republicans in charge of Congress refused to seat them. In 1872, he unsuccessfully ran for the 4th congressional district House seat against Republican Alexander S. Wallace. His son, William Hayne Perry, did successfully gain election to the House and was a member from 1885 to 1891. Perry died in Greenville on December 3, 1886 and was interred at Christ Church Episcopal Cemetery.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Benjamin Franklin Perry', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7455840'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7456881', 'text': 'Agios Spyridonas\\n\\nAgios Spyridonas (Greek meaning Saint Spyridon) may refer to the following places in Greece:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Agios Spyridonas', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7456881'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7457756', 'text': 'Louis-Pierre Norblin\\n\\nLouis Pierre Martin Norblin (2 December 1781, in Warsaw â 14 July 1854, in Connantre) was a French musician.

An offhore seismic survey in 1954 showed the field extended some miles to the southeast.

This Ruysch map was published and widely distributed in 1507.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nIn old documents Ruysch was sometimes called a Fleming or German, but he was likely born in Utrecht in the current Netherlands. It is thought (see the Beneventanus commentary below) that he accompanied John Cabot on his expedition to North America in 1497 and 1498, or, considering the prevalence of Portuguese names on his 1507 map, a Portuguese ship leaving from Bristol. Around 1505, Ruysch probably entered the Benedictine monastery of St. Martin in Cologne as a secular priest. Soon he left for Rome, where pope Julius II gave him a dispensation concerning his priestly occupation. He presumably made his world map there in 1507, appears on payrolls in 1508 and 1509 and seems to have specialized in decorative painting. He is thought to be the âFleming called Johnâ, a close friend of Raphael who at one point resided with him. It has been suggested that he assisted and advised Raphael on his 1509-1510 âAstronomiaâ and other frescoes in the Stanza della segnatura. Not long after, Ruysch went to work at the Portuguese court as cartographer and astronomer, presumably by recommendation of Julius II who was friends with Manuel I of Portugal. Later, he returned to the St. Martin monastery, suffering from consumption, but able to create a, now lost, astronomical wall painting illustrating the days, months (phases of the Moon), and constellations. He is said to have died at considerable age in 1533 at the monastery, where he had a room adjacent to the library.\\n\\nSection::::Age of discovery.\\nThere had been many voyages of discovery immediately before Ruysch created his map :\\n\\nAlthough there had been maps created after these voyages, such as Juan de la Cosaâs map of the world in 1500 (based on Columbus\\' second voyage) and the Cantino world map (circa 1502), the information on these maps was closely held and guarded as state secrets. Often a limited number of copies were made.\\n\\nSection::::Publicizing the shape of the world.\\nThis situation changed drastically from 1506 to 1507 when three separate efforts to produce world maps were published. The Contarini-Rosselli map of 1506 (now in the British Library) and Martin WaldseemÃ¼ller\\'s map of the world and globe of 1507 were very influential, but not very widely published. There is only one original copy of each in existence, and both of these copies were discovered in the 20th century. By contrast, Johannes Ruysch\\'s 1507 map of the world was much more widely published and many copies were produced and still exist. It therefore had a very large influence.\\n\\nSection::::The Ruysch Map of 1507.\\nRuysch\\'s 1507 map of the world was included in the 1507 and 1508 southern editions of \"Ptolemy\\'s\" \"Geographia\", an atlas published in Rome. The editor of the 1507 edition of the Geographia was Evangelista Tosinus and the printer was Bernardinus Venetus de Vitalibus.\\n\\nThe Ruysch map uses Ptolemy\\'s first projection, a coniform projection, as does the Contarini-Rosselli map. Both document Christopher Columbus\\' discoveries as well as the discoveries of John Cabot, as well as including information from Portuguese sources and Marco Polo\\'s account of his travels. There are notes on his map that clearly were from Portuguese sources.\\n\\nNewfoundland is shown connected to Asia in the Ruysch map, as Cabot believed. The presence of codfish is noted on the Ruysch map in the area of the Grand Banks of Newfoundland.\\n\\nGreenland is shown connected to Newfoundland and Asia on Ruysch\\'s map, and not Europe as earlier maps had showed. Around the north pole, Ruysch drew islands, based on reports in the book \"Inventio Fortunata\" of the English friar Nicholas of Lynne. The island above Norway shows remarkable similarities to Svalbard, which would not be discovered until 1597 (by Willem Barents). Ruysch calls it \\'European Hyberborea\\' and a peninsula stretching out towards it is clearly marked with the church of \\'Sancti Odulfi\\', St Olaf\\'s church in VardÃ¸ on the Finnmark coast.\\n\\nRuysch\\'s map contains the discoveries the Portuguese had made along the African coast. Ruysch\\'s map shows Africa as a peninsula surrounded by water. The horn of Africa on Ruysch\\'s map is at approximately the correct latitude. Ruysch\\'s map shows India as a triangular peninsula with Ceylon in the correct proportion and position.\\n\\nRuysch\\'s map has details about Asia based on data gathered by travelers like Marco Polo, as well as Greco-Roman authorities. Unaware of the existence of the Pacific Ocean he, like Christopher Columbus, saw Central and North America as the eastern part of Asia. He accepted that \"Sipango\" [Japan] and \"Hispaniola\" [Haiti] were one and the same, a concept he expressed in the legend he inscribed on his world map: Marco Polo says that 1500 miles to the east of the port of ZAITON (Quanzhou) there is a very large island called SIPANGO whose inhabitants are idolaters: they have their own king and pay tribute to none. Here there is a great amount of gold and gems of all kinds. But as the islands discovered by Spanish ships occupy this place, we do not dare to put this island here, believing what the Spaniards call SPAGNOLA to be SIPANGO, for everything that is written of Sipango is found in Spagnola except for the idolatry.\\n\\nSection::::Map commentary.\\nThere was a map commentary also included in the 1508 edition, entitled and written by an Italian Celestinian monk named Marcus Beneventanus. Beneventanus, wrote in the commentary on the Ruysch map for the 1508 Ptolemy edition: \\n\\nCommentary:\\nThe church \"Sancti Odulfi\" shown on Ruysch\\'s map, is not the church in VardÃ¸, Finnmark, but the cathedral in Trondheim.

With a population of approximately 128,140 (December 2017), it is currently the capital of the Opole Voivodeship and, also the seat of Opole County. With its long history dating back to the 8th century, Opole is one of the oldest cities in Poland. It is also the smallest city in Poland to be the largest city in a voivodeship.\\n\\nThe origins of the first settlement are connected with the town being granted Magdeburg Rights in 1217 by Casimir I of Opole, the great-grandson of Polish Duke BolesÅaw III Wrymouth. During the Medieval Period and the Renaissance the city was known as a centre of commerce due to its position on the intersection of several main trade routes, which helped to generate steady profits from transit trade. The rapid development of the town was also caused by the establishment of a seat of regency in Opole in 1816. The first railway connection between Opole, Brzeg and WrocÅaw was opened in 1843 and the first manufacturing plants were constructed in 1859, which greatly contributed to the city\\'s regional significance.\\n\\nThe city\\'s extensive heritage entails almost all cultures of Central Europe including years of Polish, Bohemian, Prussian and German rule. Opole formally became part of Poland again in 1945 under the Potsdam Agreement. Many German Upper Silesians and Poles of German ancestry still reside in the Opole region; in the city itself, however, ethnic Germans today make up less than 3% of the population following the 1945-6 expulsions.\\n\\nToday there are four higher education establishments in the city: The Opole University, Opole University of Technology, a Medical College and the private Higher College of Management and Administration. The National Festival of Polish Song has been held here annually since 1963 and each year new regular events, fairs, shows and competitions take place.\\n\\nOpole is sometimes referred to as \"Polish Venice\", because of its picturesque Old Town and several canals and bridges connecting parts of the city.\\n\\nSection::::Name.\\nThe name \"\"Opole\"\" likely originated from the medieval Slavic term for a group of settlements.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::In Medieval Poland.\\nOpole\\'s history begins in the 8th century. At this time, according to the archeological excavations, the first Slavic settlement was founded on the OstrÃ³wek - the northern part of the Pasieka Island in the middle of the Oder river. In the early 10th century it developed into one of the main \"gords\" of the Slavic Opolanie tribe. \\n\\nAt the end of the century Silesia became part of Poland and was ruled by the Piast dynasty; the land of the pagan Opolanie was conquered by Duke Mieszko I in 992. From the 11th-12th centuries it was also a castellany. After the death of Duke WÅadysÅaw II the Exile, Silesia was divided in 1163 between two Piast lines- the WrocÅaw line in Lower Silesia and the Opole-RacibÃ³rz of Upper Silesia. Opole would become a duchy in 1172 and would share much in common with the Duchy of RacibÃ³rz, with which it was often combined. In 1281 Upper Silesia was divided further between the heirs of the dukes. The Duchy of Opole was temporarily reestablished in 1290.\\n\\nIn the early 13th century, Duke Casimir I of Opole decided to move the settlement from the Pasieka Island into the right shore of the Oder river (since the 17th century it is the old stream bed of Oder known as MÅynÃ³wka). All of the inhabitants had to be moved in order to make place for the castle that was eventually built in the place of the old city. Former inhabitants of OstrÃ³wek together with German merchants that immigrated here from the West, received first town rights probably as early as around 1217, although this date is disputed. Opole received German town law in 1254, which was expanded with Neumarkt law in 1327. Opole developed during the rule of duke Bolko I of Opole. In this time the castle was finally completed and new buildings, including the city walls and the Holy Cross Church, were constructed. \\n\\nAlong with most of Silesia, in 1327 the Duchy of Opole came under the sovereignty of the Kingdom of Bohemia, itself part of the Holy Roman Empire. In 1521 the Duchy of RacibÃ³rz (\"Ratibor\") was inherited by the Duchy of Opole, by then also known by its German equivalent - Oppeln. The second castle of Opole was probably founded in the 14th century by duke Vladislaus II, though some sources claim that it was originally a wooden stronghold of Opole\\'s castellan dating into 12th century.\\n\\nSection::::In the Habsburg Monarchy.\\nWith the death of King LudvÃ­k II of Bohemia at the Battle of MohÃ¡cs, Silesia was inherited by Ferdinand I, placing Opole under the sovereignty of the Habsburg Monarchy of Austria. The Habsburgs took control of the region in 1532 after the last Piast duke of Opole - Jan II the Good died. In those days the city was still mainly Polish-speaking (around 63%), with other nationalities represented mainly by Germans, Czechs and Jews. The last two dukes of Opole, Nicholas II and Janusz II the Good, did not master the German language.\\n\\nBeginning in 1532 the Habsburgs pawned the duchy to different rulers including several monarchs of Poland (see Dukes of Opole). With the abdication of King John II Casimir of Poland as the last Duke of Opole in 1668, the region passed to the direct control of the Habsburgs. At the beginning of the 18th century the German population of Opole was estimated at around 20%.\\n\\nSection::::In Prussian Silesia.\\nKing Frederick II of Prussia conquered most of Silesia from Austria in 1740 during the Silesian Wars; Prussian control was confirmed in the Peace of Breslau in 1742. During the Prussian rule the ethnic structure of the city began to change. In the early 20th century the number of Polish and bilingual citizens of Opole, according to the official German statistics, varied from only 25% to 31%. From 1816â1945 Opole was the capital of Regierungsbezirk Oppeln within Prussia. The city became part of the German Empire during the unification of Germany in 1871.\\n\\nSection::::After World War I.\\nAfter the defeat of Imperial Germany in World War I, a plebiscite was held on 20 March 1921 in Oppeln to determine if the city would be in the Weimar Republic or become part of the Second Polish Republic. 20,816 (94.7%) votes were cast for Germany, 1,098 (5.0%) for Poland, and 70 (0.3%) votes were declared invalid. Voter participation was 95.9%. Results of the plebiscite in the Oppeln-Land county were different, with 30% of population voting for Poland.\\n\\nOppeln was the administrative seat of the Province of Upper Silesia from 1919â1939. With the defeat of Poland in the invasion of Poland at the beginning of World War II in 1939, formerly Polish Eastern Upper Silesia was re-added to the Province of Upper Silesia and Oppeln lost its status as provincial capital to Katowice (renamed Kattowitz).\\n\\nOn 15 February 1941 and 26 February 1941, two deportation transports with 2,003 Jewish men, women and children on board left Vienna Aspang Station for the ghetto which had been set up in Oppeln. By March 1941, 8,000 Jews were deported to Oppeln. From May 1941, 800 men capable of work were deployed as forced labourers in Deblin. The \"Liquidation\" of the Oppeln ghetto began in the spring 1942. A transport to Belzec extermination camp left on 31 March 1942 and deportations to Sobibor followed in May and October 1942. Of the 2,003 Viennese Jews, only twenty-eight are known to have survived.\\n\\nSection::::In modern Poland.\\nAfter the end of the Second World War in 1945, Oppeln was transferred from Germany to Poland according to the Potsdam Conference, and given its original Slavic name of Opole. Opole became part of the Katowice Voivodeship from 1946â1950, after which it became part of the Opole Voivodeship. Unlike other parts of the so-called Recovered Territories, Opole and the surrounding region\\'s indigenous population remained and was not forcibly expelled as elsewhere. Over 1 million Silesians who considered themselves Poles or were treated as such by the authorities due to their language and customs were allowed to stay after they were verified as Poles in a special verification process. It involved declaring Polish nationality and an oath of allegiance to the Polish nation.\\n\\nIn the later years however many of them left to West Germany to flee the communist Eastern Bloc (see Emigration from Poland to Germany after World War II). Today Opole, along with the surrounding region, is known as a centre of the German minority in Poland that recruits mainly from the descendants of the positively verified autochthons. In the city itself however only 2.46% of the inhabitants declared German nationality according to the last national census of 2002.\\n\\nOn January 1, 2017, Borki, Chmielowice, CzarnowÄsy, Krzanowice, SÅawice, Åwierkle, WinÃ³w, Wrzoski, Å»erkowice as well as parts of Brzezie, DobrzeÅ MaÅy and KarczÃ³w became a part of Opole, enlargening its population by about 9,500, and its area by over 5,300 ha, despite the protests of inhabitants.\\n\\nSection::::Historical population.\\nIn the early 20th century the number of Polish and bilingual citizens of Opole, according to the official German statistics, varied from 25 to 31%.\\n\\nÂ¹ First census of the city\\n\\nÂ² 8,320 German nationality (93.7%) and 557 Polish nationality (6.3%)\\n\\nÂ³ 80% German-speaking, 16% Polish-speaking, and 4% bilingual Polish-German-speaking\\n\\nSection::::German minority.\\nAlongside German and Polish, many citizens of Opole-Oppeln before 1945 used a strongly German-influenced Silesian dialect (sometimes called \"wasserpolnisch\" or \"wasserpolak\"). Because of this, the post-war Polish state administration after the annexation of Silesia in 1945 did not initiate a general expulsion of all former inhabitants of Opole, as was done in Lower Silesia, for instance, where the population almost exclusively spoke the German language. Because they were considered \"autochthonous\" (Polish), the Wasserpolak-speakers instead received the right to remain in their homeland after declaring themselves as Poles. Some German speakers took advantage of this decision, allowing them to remain in their Oppeln, even when they considered themselves to be of German nationality. The city surroundings currently contain the largest German and Upper Silesian minorities in Poland. However, Opole itself is only 2.46% German. (See also Germans of Poland.)\\n\\nSection::::Main sights.\\nOpole hosts the annual National Festival of Polish Song. The city is also known for its 10th-century Church of St. Adalbert and the 14th-century Church of the Holy Cross. There is a zoo, the OgrÃ³d Zoologiczny w Opolu.\\n\\nStructures and buildings\\n\\nMuseums\\n\\nCemeteries\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nOpole is one of the warmest cities in Poland.

The French building materials company Lafarge is also active in the area, having its roofing division, Lafarge Roofing, together with its German subsidiary Schiedel (chimney manufacturing) based in Opole.\\n\\nOther companies in the city include: the German valve manufacturer Kludi; the German men\\'s fashion manufacturer Ahlers and the American automotive manufacturer Tower Automative. As is the case with the entire Opole Voivodeship, there is a strong presence of food industry services in the city. The largest companies in the food sector include: Zott, the Dutch baby food and nutrition company Nutricia, part of the Danone food-products corporation.\\n\\nOpole has branches of all major banks, including: PKO, Pekao, Deutsche Bank and Raiffeisen Zentralbank.\\n\\nThe retail sector in Opole includes major Metro AG brand stores: Metro Cash and Carry and Media-Saturn-Holding, as well as Real. The city has a plethora of other major supermarket chains, namely: the Polish supermarket chains Biedronka, Lidl, Aldi and Netto. Other major brand stores include the shoe retailer Deichmann and Rossmann drugstores.\\n\\nFurthermore, the city has three major shopping centres. The Solaris Center, with a total of 86 shops, opened in May 2009 and is located in the centre of MikoÅaj Kopernik Square. In the city\\'s suburbs, by WrocÅawska Street (\"ul. WrocÅawska\") is the location of Karolinka Shopping Centre (\"Centrum Handlowe Karolinka\"). The shopping centre, which opened in September 2008, has a total area of 38,000 mÂ², with a total of 99 stores, including fashion, hardware and electronics stores. To the east of the city, by the National Road 46, is the smallest of the three shopping centres, Turawa Park, with a total of 50 stores. Other shopping centres include \"Galeria Opolanin\", built between 1974 and 1981 and upon its completion, was the largest shopping centre in Poland.\\n\\n\\nSection::::International relations.\\nSection::::Twin towns - Sister cities.\\nOpole is twinned with:\\n\\n\\n<br>\\n', 'title': 'Opole', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=74610', 'cat_id': '74610', 'cat_title': 'British_philanthropists', 'cat_pages': '282', 'cat_subcats': '7', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '746201', 'text': 'Chanoch\\n\\nChanoch may refer to:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Chanoch', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=746201'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '746540', 'text': \"Mega Records\\n\\nMega Records was a Nashville, Tennessee-based music label founded in 1970 by former RCA Records executive Brad McCuen along with Henry Pratt.

After the 1911 revolution he attended Guangxi Military Cadre Training School in Guilin along with Bai Chongxi and Li Zongren. Later he rose to command the Model Battalion, a modern professional military formation equipped with machine guns.\\n\\nIn the confused power struggles following the Ao-Gui Wars, local military figures began to carve out territory in Guangxi and dominate it. In the southwest were the opium trails from both Yunnan and Guizhou that ran through Baise and then down the river to Nanning, from whence opium usually went out through Wuzhou, where the trade was financed. \\nDuring the Ao-Gui wars Huang, then the commander of the Model Battalion, attempted to stay neutral and relocated to Baise in the far northwest. By stages he came to control Baise, and with it the opium trade. Later he expanded his control to Wuzhou, thus locking up the portals through which opium both entered and left Guangxi. By the spring of 1924 the new Guangxi Clique had formed and created the Guangxi Pacification Army. Li Zongren was the Commander-in-Chief, Huang the deputy Commander and Bai Chongxi the Chief of Staff. By August they had defeated and driven former ruler Lu Rongting and other contenders out of the province and Huang became the civil governor of Guangxi from 1924-29. He was also interior and transportation minister in the National Government of Chiang Kai-shek after 1927.\\n\\nDuring the Kumul Rebellion Chiang Kai-shek was ready to send Huang and his expeditionary force, which he assembled to assist Muslim Gen. Ma Zhongying against Sheng Shicai, but when Chiang heard about the Soviet Invasion of Xinjiang, he decided to withdraw to avoid an international incident if his troops directly engaged the Soviets, leaving Ma alone without reinforcements to fight the Red Army.\\n\\nHuang became chairman of the government of Zhejiang from 1934â35 and Hubei from 1936-37. Again from 1937-46 he became chairman of the government of Zhejiang and commander of the 15th Army of the National Revolutionary Army. During World War II he was named deputy commander-in-chief of the 2nd War Zone. After the war he was named head of the Supervisory Committee and elected member of the Legislative Yuan (parliament).\\n\\nDuring the Chinese Civil War peace talks in March 1949, he was one of the Kuomintang delegates. He and Zhang Zhizhong agreed to accept the cease-fire conditions submitted by the Communist Party. When the Kuomintang leadership turned them down later, Huang fled to Hong Kong and declared his revolt from the KMT and joined the Chinese People\\'s Political Consultative Conference (CPPCC) in September 1949.\\n\\nAfter the founding of the People\\'s Republic, Huang was elected a member of the State Council, National People\\'s Congress, and CPPCC. He was also a member of the Standing Committee of the Kuomintang Revolutionary Committee. During the Anti-Rightist Movement, Huang was labeled a rightist. Later, during the Cultural Revolution, he was again determined to be a \"rightist.\" Unable to stand the persecution of the Red Guards, he committed suicide at home on August 31, 1966, in Beijing.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Huang Shaohong', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7471019'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '747171', 'text': 'Barrancabermeja\\n\\nBarrancabermeja is a city in Colombia, located on the shore of the Magdalena River, in the western part of the department of Santander.

Although he lived in New York City for much of his adult career, Ryan was perhaps the greatest benefactor of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Richmond in the decades before the Great Depression. In addition to paying for schools, hospitals and other charitable works, Ryan\\'s donations paid for the construction of the Cathedral of the Sacred Heart in Richmond, Virginia. Ryan also made significant donations to Catholic institutions in New York City and Washington, D.C.\\n\\nSection::::Early days.\\nThomas Fortune Ryan was born on October 17, 1851, near Lovingston, Virginia, the county seat of Nelson County. Despite a myth promulgated by Cleveland Amory regarding his background, Ryan was neither orphaned nor penniless as a youth, nor did his ancestors flee the Potato Famine as did many who worked on or rode his streetcars. Rural Virginia where Ryan grew up attracted few of those emigrants. Ryan\\'s father was a tailor and managed a small hotel. He traced his ancestry to Protestant Anglo-Irish settlers who came to North America in the seventeenth century.\\n\\nRyan\\'s mother, Lucinda Fortune Ryan, died in 1856 when he was five years old. His father remarried and moved to Tennessee two years later. Ryan was raised as a Protestant by his mother\\'s extended family in Lovingston, south of Charlottesville in Virginia\\'s Piedmont. Local Baptist ministers taught the youth to read and write, but Ryan did not attend college. Before the American Civil War, Ryan and his younger brother owned three slaves.\\n\\nSection::::Conversion.\\nAged 17, three years after the war ended, Ryan fled the lack of economic opportunity for post-war Virginia and so moved to the nearest big city, Baltimore, Maryland with $100 in his pocket. En route, Ryan converted to Catholicism, purportedly after long discussions with the conductor.\\n\\nIn Baltimore, John S. Barry, a prosperous dry goods merchant and Catholic, hired young Ryan. By 1872, Barry helped Ryan secure a brokerage assistant position on Wall Street where he would be tutored by William Collins Whitney.\\n\\nSection::::Fortune building.\\nRyan opened a brokerage firm with two partners, Lee, Ryan & Warren, the following year.\\n\\nIn 1873 Ryan married his former boss\\'s daughter, Ida Mary Barry, whose family were devout Roman Catholics. They had seven children. In 1874, his firm purchased Ryan a seat on the New York Stock Exchange. At the same time, Ryan became active in politics, especially the Tammany Hall machine that controlled much of the city\\'s operations, giving him political and industrial contacts across the city.\\n\\nRyan\\'s fortune began in public transit. In 1883, he founded the New York Cable Railroad and bid on the proposed route from lower Manhattan to Midtown. After numerous legal and financial problems, in 1886 Ryan reorganized his cable railroad as the Metropolitan Traction Company. By 1893, construction of Ryan\\'s rail system was underway on Broadway. Metropolitan continually acquired additional lines so that by 1900 it controlled 3,000 cars and 300 miles of track the majority of New Yorkâs streetcar operations. \\n\\nRyan\\'s most profitable investment was tobacco. Having invested in its stocks throughout the 1890s, Ryan joined tobacco assets in 1898, forming The Union Tobacco Company. Shortly thereafter, he merged Union Tobacco with his greatest competitor, James Duke of North Carolina, forming the American Tobacco Company. Together Ryan and Duke developed the British-American Tobacco Company to protect American tobacco trade in Europe. Upon his death, Ryan also had major holdings in R. J. Reynolds and Liggett & Myers.\\n\\nIn 1905, amid public outcry, Ryan purchased the $400-million-strong Equitable Life Assurance Society, a major factor in the insurance industry. Although Ryan strove to make Equitable more responsive to its policy holders, public reaction to his purchase was overwhelmingly negative. His reputation for cutthroat business dealings in the streetcar and subway businesses made the public distrustful. In 1909, Ryan sold his Equitable stock. Also in 1905, Ryan\\'s Metropolitan street car system was threatened by New Yorkâs increasingly popular subway system. He merged Metropolitan with August Belmont Jr.\\'s Interborough Rapid Transit Company. But the joint companyâs finances were shaky, and Ryan pulled out. Meanwhile, some $35 million that Ryan had raised in a bond issue were misappropriated. Ryan was investigated for corruption in 1908, but the grand jury brought no charges. \\n\\nMeanwhile, Ryan was making fortunes with coal mines, banks, public utilities and railroads. He owned Royal Typewriter and backed the maker of the Thompson submachine gun. At one time Ryan had controlling interest in 30 corporations.\\n\\nSection::::Philanthropy.\\nAs her husband\\'s wealth grew exponentially, Ida Barry Ryan began making large benefactions to Catholic charitable organizations in New York, Virginia, and across the country. The Ryans funded churches, convents and hospitals in Manhattan, including the architecturally important St. Jean Baptiste Catholic Church on the Upper East Side. In Washington, D.C., they paid for a gymnasium and dormitory at the Jesuit-founded Georgetown University.\\n\\nIn 1901, the Ryans funded the construction of Sacred Heart Church and Sacred Heart School on Perry Street in Manchester, Virginia (now part of Richmond). In the same year, the Ryans donated $250,000 to build a new cathedral in Richmond, and soon doubled that donation to ensure that the interior would be of the highest workmanship. The Cathedral of the Sacred Heart, whose cornerstone was laid by the apostolic delegate on June 4, 1903, was dedicated by the same nuncio on November 29, 1906, and remains one of the metropolitan area\\'s architectural landmarks. Other Ryan gifts in Virginia included the Cathedral High and the Cathedral Primary schools in Richmond.\\n\\nIn October 1903, Ryan and his wife donated a two-story brick and steam heated building near the Newport News Shipyard to the Sisters of Charity of Nazareth so they could start a Catholic girls school (to be named St. Vincent\\'s de Paul School and later renamed Peninsula Catholic High School). In June 1904, they donated a new building for the Sisters and their 104 students in their charge. The Ryans also financed construction of Catholic churches in Harrisonburg and Charlottesville.\\n\\nPope Pius X recognized the couple\\'s generosity by naming him to the papal nobility and giving Ida Ryan the cross \"Pro Ecclesia et Pontifice\" for her work in the Diocese. The couple\\'s lifetime contributions to Catholic charities around the country totalled $20 million. However, Mrs. Ryan refused to allow any funds to be used for \"colored work\" (including schools and hospitals for Virginia\\'s freed blacks, despite diocescan missionary priorities of the time).\\n\\nThe Ryans\\' philanthropy also extended to Southern history, the fine arts and exploration. Ryan financed and selected Charles Hoffbauer to create a series of paintings, \"The Four Seasons of the Confederacy\", commissioned for a major gallery in what is now the Virginia Historical Society. For Jamestown\\'s 300th anniversary in 1907, Ryan donated a collection of portraits of key players in Virginia\\'s settlement. Thomas Ryan also helped finance Virginia explorer Richard E. Byrd\\'s flight to the South Pole. \\n\\nIn 1887, the Ryans bought the Groesbeck mansion near Suffern, New York, a major town on the Erie Railroad, and rebuilt it into a summer home they called \"Montebello\". During the three decades before her death, Ida Barry Ryan funded the construction of the Catholic Church of the Sacred Heart of Jesus, as well as the Good Samaritan Hospital.\\n\\nSection::::Later years.\\nRyan announced his intention to retire in 1912. Re-establishing his roots in his native state of Virginia, he had since 1901 maintained \"Oak Ridge\" in Nelson County, formerly the estate of tobacco trader William Rives and later of former Confederate and U.S. Congressman William Porcher Miles. Ryan also became as a Virginia delegate to the Democratic National Convention in 1912, which selected fellow Virginian Woodrow Wilson as the party\\'s presidential candidate.\\n\\nIn 1916, Thomas Fortune Ryan was also the principal financial backer of John T. Thompsons Auto-Ordnance Company for the purpose of developing his \"auto rifle\" and the Thompson Submachine-Gun.\\n\\nOn October 17, 1917, on his 66th birthday, his wife Ida died from heart disease. Twelve days later the widower Ryan married widow Mary Townsend Lord Cuyler. The resulting scandal did not deter Belgian Cardinal Desire-Joseph Mercier from accepting Ryan\\'s proffered private railway car in 1919, which he used in touring the United States and accepting honorary degrees and awards concerning his country\\'s defense against the invading Germans.\\n\\nSection::::Death and legacy.\\nOn November 23, 1928, Thomas Fortune Ryan died, the South\\'s wealthiest native son and the nation\\'s 10th wealthiest man. He left a fortune of more than $200 million. He was buried on his Oak Ridge estate, as was his second wife, Mary. Although a place had been reserved for Ida Barry Ryan in the crypt of Richmond\\'s Sacred Heart Cathedral, she was ultimately interred in the cemetery at St. Andrews-on-Hudson Seminary in Hyde Park, New York (now The Culinary Institute of America).\\n\\nRyan\\'s eldest son John Barry Ryan (1874â1942) became a financier and writer. His grandson Allan A. Ryan Jr. (1903â1981) was a New York State Senator from 1939 to 1942. His granddaughter Sally Ryan was a noted art collector. A great-granddaughter is Virginia Fortune Ryan Ogilvy, Countess of Airlie, wife of David Ogilvy, 13th Earl of Airlie. Grandson Joseph Bondurant Ryan (1906â1950) was the visionary developer of the Mont Tremblant ski resort in Quebec. Joseph\\'s son Peter (1940â1962) was the first Canadian to compete in Formula 1 auto racing and the winner of the first Canadian Grand Prix in 1961.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Thomas Fortune Ryan', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=747853'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7480385', 'text': 'John Owen (cricketer)\\n\\nJohn Edward Houghton Owen (born 7 August 1971) is a former English cricketer represented Derbyshire between 1994 and 1999.\\n\\nOwen was the son of David Owen who was a cricketer for the Derbyshire Second XI during the early part of the 1970s.

These two companies have been competing since the 1890s, but their rivalry has intensified since the 1980s.\\n\\nSection::::Flavorings.\\nThe primary modern flavoring ingredients in a cola drink are citrus oils (from orange, lime, and lemon peels), cinnamon, vanilla, and an acidic flavorant. Manufacturers of cola drinks add trace flavorings to create distinctively different tastes for each brand. Trace flavorings may include a wide variety of ingredients, such as spices like nutmeg or coriander, but the base flavorings that most people identify with a cola taste remain citrus, vanilla and cinnamon. Acidity is often provided by phosphoric acid, sometimes accompanied by citric or other isolated acids. Coca-Cola\\'s recipe is maintained as a corporate trade secret.\\n\\nA variety of different sweeteners may be added to cola, often partly dependent on local agricultural policy. High-fructose corn syrup (HFCS) is predominantly used in the United States and Canada due to the lower cost of government-subsidized corn. In Europe, however, HFCS is subject to production quotas designed to encourage the production of sugar; sugar is thus typically used to sweeten sodas. In addition, stevia or an artificial sweetener may be used; \"sugar-free\" or \"diet\" colas typically contain artificial sweeteners only.\\n\\nSection::::Clear cola.\\nIn the 1940s, Coca-Cola produced White Coke at the request of Marshal of the Soviet Union Georgy Zhukov.\\n\\nClear colas were again produced during the Clear Craze of the early 1990s. Brands included Crystal Pepsi, Tab Clear, and 7 Up Ice Cola. Crystal Pepsi has been repeatedly reintroduced in the 2010s.\\n\\nIn Denmark, a popular clear cola was made by the Cooperative FDB in 1976. It was especially known for being the \"Hippie Cola\" because of the focus of the harmful effects the color additive could have on children and the boycott of multinational brands. It was inspired by a campaign on harmful additives in Denmark by the Environmental-Organisation NOAH, an independent Danish division of Friends of the Earth. This was followed up with a variety of sodas without artificial coloring. Today many organic colas are available in Denmark, but, for nostalgic reasons, clear cola has still maintained its popularity to a certain degree.\\n\\nIn June 2018, Coca-Cola introduced Coca-Cola Clear in Japan.\\n\\nSection::::Health effects.\\nA 2007 study found that consumption of colas, both those with natural sweetening and those with artificial sweetening, was associated with increased risk of chronic kidney disease. The phosphoric acid used in colas was thought to be a possible cause.\\n\\nStudies indicate \"soda and sweetened drinks are the main source of calories in [the] American diet\", so most nutritionists advise that Coca-Cola and other soft drinks can be harmful if consumed excessively, particularly to young children whose soft drink consumption competes with, rather than complements, a balanced diet. Studies have shown that regular soft drink users have a lower intake of calcium, magnesium, vitamin C, riboflavin, and vitamin A.\\n\\nThe drink has also aroused criticism for its use of caffeine, which can cause physical dependence (caffeine addiction). A link has been shown between long-term regular cola intake and osteoporosis in older women (but not men). This was thought to be due to the presence of phosphoric acid, and the risk was found to be the same for caffeinated and noncaffeinated colas, as well as the same for diet and sugared colas.\\n\\nMany soft drinks are sweetened mostly or entirely with high-fructose corn syrup, rather than sugar. Some nutritionists caution against consumption of corn syrup because it may aggravate obesity and type-2 diabetes more than cane sugar.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Cola', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7491', 'cat_id': '7491', 'cat_title': '1563', 'cat_pages': '19', 'cat_subcats': '15', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'NAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7492157', 'text': 'Petit bonhomme\\n\\n\"Petit bonhomme\" (English translation: \"Little Boy\") was the Luxembourgish entry in the Eurovision Song Contest 1962, performed in French by Luxembourgish singer Camillo Felgen.\\n\\nThis was Felgen\\'s second appearance on the Eurovision stage, in the 1960 Contest he had also represented Luxembourg, singing \"So laang we\\'s du do bast\" in Luxembourgish.\\n\\n\"Petit bonhomme\" is a ballad, with Felgen singing to a boy he identifies as his son near the end of the lyric.

Jeff Vrabel of \"Billboard\" remarked that the collection\\'s songs \"range from the interestingly raw to the unlistenable, especially when the band trades its slow-rolling, dub-style vibe for stabs at lo-fi punk.\" An article in the December 2006 issue of \"Spin\" said the box set is \"as close as Bradley Nowell cultists will ever get to a new Sublime release.\"\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Everything Under the Sun', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7493068'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'NwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '74931', 'text': 'Inside Nazi Germany\\n\\nInside Nazi Germany is a 1938 short documentary film about Nazi Germany directed by Jack Glenn.

His works include \"Hart\\'s Hymns\", a much-loved hymn book amongst evangelical Christians throughout its lifetime of over 200 years, which includes the well-known hymn, \"Come ye sinners, poor and needy\".\\n\\nOne of Joseph Hart\\'s early publications was a tract denouncing Christianity (prior to his conversion) called \"The Unreasonableness of Religion, Being Remarks and Animadversions on the Rev. John Wesley\\'s Sermon on Romans 8:32\". His other works include a short autobiography and a few poetical translations of ancient classics.\\n\\nJoseph Hart preached at Jewin Street chapel in London, a building with multiple galleries, to a congregation of significant size.\\n\\nOnly one of Hart\\'s sermons remains discovered to us: that of Christmas 1767. Several of his hymns appear in the Sacred Harp.\\n\\nHart died on 24 May 1768, with a congregation estimated at tens of thousands around his graveside at Bunhill Fields.\\n\\nSection::::Early life (1712 to about 1732).\\nNot much is known about Hart\\'s early life due to scanty documentation.\\nJoseph Hart had a good educational upbringing, learning the classic languages (Latin, Hebrew, and Greek) to perfection, which afterwards he taught for a living. Hart spent a lot of his early life translating and writing poetry.\\n\\nIt was in this period of his life that Hart translated Herodian and Phycolides.\\n\\nHart writes about his early life in his own autobiography:\\n\\n\"As I had the happiness of being born of believing parents, I imbibed the sound doctrine of the Gospel from my infancy; nor was I without touches of the heart, checks of the conscience, and meltings of affections, by the secret strivings of God\\'s Spirit within me while very young; but the impressions were not deep, nor the influences lasting, being frequently defaced and quenched by the vanities and vices of childhood and youth.\\n\\nHart was brought up to be a good Christian and to praise God, but soon fell into temptation and sinned.\\n\\nSection::::Good works (about 1732 to about 1740).\\nJoseph Hart begins to see that his youthful sins are wrong, and decides he must learn to be a better person. It all seems to be going well, but there is one sin yet; Hart is proud of his new status as a religious man. Later Hart repents of this sin of pride and denounces it.\\n\\nIt is about this time of turmoil in Hart\\'s life, that he meets a girl (14 years younger than himself) called Mary, falls in love with her, and they get married.\\n\\nSection::::A libertine and an author (from about 1740 to about 1751/52).\\nIt was during this period of Hart\\'s life that he left off doing his good works, and became a libertine, believing that there is no need to be righteous, all you need is to believe in God, then salvation is certain. It was then that he wrote \"The Unreasonableness of Religion\", in an effort to convince John Wesley that he should not be doing good works only believing in God. Evidently the pamphlet had no effect upon Wesley, being accounted mere blasphemy. Later Hart repented of writing the pamphlet, giving his universal apology to John Wesley.\\n\\nDuring this period, Hart also translated Phycolides from the original Greek in 1744, and Herodian from its original Latin in 1749.\\n\\nSection::::A true conversion.\\nHart later considered that there was a need both to do good works and to believe in God. But then came the uncertainty: Was he really and truly saved? He had no indication from God, no elaborate vision, telling him that he had been saved. This was a great worry to Joseph Hart. He began to pray to God that there would be some revelation granted him, or perhaps just a little sign. This tormented Hart for more than a year.\\n\\nThen, the week before Easter of the year 1757 Hart \"had such an amazing view of the agony of Christ in the garden [of gethsemane]\" showing to Hart that all Christ\\'s sufferings were for him (along with the rest of the church).\\n\\nBut soon after this, Hart again began to be afraid of the life to come- eternity, and feared exceedingly when reading about the condemned in passages in the Bible.\\n\\nBut It was on Whitsunday that Hart\\'s true conversion came. Hart was converted under the ministry of George Whitefield, and felt blessed in his soul.\\n\\nAfter these times Hart still had sufferings and uncertainties as to his conversion, but he could always look back to his conversion, and believe that God saved his soul.\\n\\nHart\\'s motto after this time was: \"Pharasaic zeel and Antinomian security are the two engines of Satan, with which he grinds the church in all ages, as betwixt [between] the upper and the nether [lower] millstone. The space between them is much narrower and harder to find than most men imagine. It is a path which the vulture\\'s eye hath not seen; and none can show it us but the Holy Ghost.\"\\n\\nOn his tombstone he had written the following.\\n\\n\"Joseph Hart was by the free and sovereign grace and Spirit of God raised up from the depths of sin, and delivered from the bonds of mere profession and self-righteousness, and led to rest entirely for salvation in the finished atonement and perfect obedience of Christ.\"\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Joseph Hart', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7529180'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7529995', 'text': 'Lott Warren\\n\\nLott Warren (October 30, 1797 â June 17, 1861) was a United States Representative from Georgia.

In the early nineteenth century, under pressure from their hostile Mohave and Quechan neighbors, they moved to the middle Gila River, where some merged with the Maricopa, and others went on to Salt River and maintained an independent identity.\\n\\nThe Halchidhoma currently speak the Maricopa language.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Halchidhoma entered written history in 1604â1605, when a Spanish expedition coming overland from New Mexico under Juan de OÃ±ate encountered the \"Alebdoma\" on the lower Colorado River, below its junction with the Gila River. When the Jesuit missionary-explorer Eusebio Francisco Kino returned to the river in 1700, the Halchidhoma had moved to a portion of the river 100 miles farther north.\\n\\nA system of military alliances and traditional hostilities seems to have prevailed among the relatively warlike tribes of the lower Colorado and Gila rivers. This may account for the Halchidhoma\\'s move during the seventeenth century. The Halchidhoma were part of an alliance that also included the Maricopa and Cocopa, among others, and was opposed by the Quechan and Mohave. In the 1820s, the Halchidhoma were finally driven from the Colorado River. They took refuge with the Maricopa on the middle Gila River. In the following decades, some continued on to Lehi on the Salt River and maintained a separate identity, while others stayed and became assimilated to the Maricopa. The territory on the Colorado River vacated by the Halchidhoma was subsequently occupied by the Chemehuevi.\\n\\nSection::::Population.\\nEstimates for the pre-contact populations of most native groups in California have varied substantially. \"(See Population of Native California.)\" The Franciscan missionary-explorer Francisco GarcÃ©s estimated the Halchidhoma population in 1776 as 2,500. Alfred L. Kroeber (1925:883) put the 1770 population of the Halchidhoma at 1,000.\\n\\nSection::::Language.\\nHistorical records indicate that there once was a separate Halchidhoma language within the Yuman family, in the River Yuman subdivision. Due to war and conflict with European settlers, the Halchidhoma settled in with the Maricopa people, in their current location around Greater Phoenix. The Halchidhoma currently identify themselves with the Maricopa tribe, and many live in Lehi, which is a small community within the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community on the south banks of the Salt River. They continue to speak what they refer to as the Halchidhoma language.\\n\\nSection::::Modern relationship with Maricopa.\\nHalchidhoma people in the Salt River Pima-Maricopa Indian Community nearly universally identify themselves in English as Maricopa, although both groups testify that they are separate, maintaining separate languages and identities (Kelly 1972:264).\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Halchidhoma', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7531626'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7532410', 'text': 'Snow Peak\\n\\nSnow Peak may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Snow Peak', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7532410'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7533517', 'text': \"Athena Technologies\\n\\nAthena Technologies was a developer and manufacturer of control and navigation solutions for unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) and unmanned ground vehicles (UGVs).

The meeting was attended by President Franklin D. Roosevelt of the United States, Prime Minister Winston Churchill of the United Kingdom, and President Ä°smet Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ of the Republic of Turkey.\\n\\nUntil 1941, both Roosevelt and Churchill maintained the opinion that Turkey\\'s continuing neutrality would serve the interests of the Allies by blocking the Axis from reaching the strategic oil reserves of the Middle East. But the early victories of the Axis until the end of 1942 caused Roosevelt and Churchill to re-evaluate a possible Turkish participation in the war on the side of the Allies. Turkey had maintained a decently-sized Army and Air Force throughout the war, and especially Churchill wanted the Turks to open a new front in the Balkans. On January 30, 1943, Churchill had secretly met with Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ inside a train wagon at the Yenice Station, 23 kilometers outside of Adana in Turkey, to discuss the issue (see the Adana Conference.)\\n\\nRoosevelt, on the other hand, still believed that a Turkish attack would be too risky and an eventual Turkish failure would have disastrous effects for the Allies.\\n\\nÄ°nÃ¶nÃ¼ knew very well the hardships and losses of territory which his country had to suffer during 11 years of incessant war (the Italo-Turkish War, the Balkan Wars, the First World War, and the Turkish War of Independence) between 1911 and 1922, and was determined to keep Turkey out of another war as long as he could. Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ also wanted assurances on financial and military aid for Turkey, as well as a guarantee that the United States and the United Kingdom would stand beside Turkey in case of a Soviet invasion of the Turkish Straits after the war, as Joseph Stalin had openly expressed. The fear of a Soviet invasion and Stalin\\'s unconcealed desire to control the Turkish Straits eventually caused Turkey to give up its principle of neutrality in foreign relations and join NATO in 1952.\\n\\nPerhaps the biggest reason for Turkey\\'s hesitation to immediately join the war on the side of the Allies was the eventual reduction of the amount of financial and military aid which Churchill had promised in Adana. By December 1943 the Anglo-American authorities felt the overall situation had changed so fundamentally that a much smaller scale of assistance than that provided in the Hardihood Agreement of the spring of 1943 would be necessary. The British proposed a reduced scale of Aid Plan Saturn. The Turks, on the other hand, wished to make certain that upon their entry into the war they would be strong enough to defend their homeland and they doubted that the new plan would fully meet their security needs. Churchill, faced with Operation Overlord only six months away, reluctantly concluded that the resources demanded and the time required for strengthening Turkey could not be conceded. The U.S. Chiefs of Staff and their planners, on the other hand, felt relieved that this possible threat to concentration on Operation Overlord had at last been removed.\\n\\nAt the end of the conference, it was decided that Turkey\\'s neutrality should be maintained. It was also decided to build the Incirlik Air Base near Adana for possible Allied air operations in the region, but construction works began after the end of the Second World War. Incirlik Air Base later played an important role for NATO during the Cold War. Another decision was to postpone Operation Anakim against Japan in Burma.\\n\\nBoth Roosevelt and Ä°nÃ¶nÃ¼ got what they wanted, while Churchill was a bit disappointed, because he believed that an active Turkish participation in the war would quicken the German defeat by hitting their \"\"soft underbelly\"\" in the southeast.\\n\\nTurkey eventually joined the war on the side of the Allies on 23 February 1945, after it was announced at the Yalta Conference that only the states which were formally at war with Germany and Japan by 1 March 1945 would be admitted to the United Nations. However, Turkey didn\\'t directly participate in a military conflict; limiting its participation to providing materials and supplies for the Allies, and imposing political and economic sanctions on the Axis states.\\n\\nAlso discussed was the independence of Indochina from the French Colonial Empire, as documented briefly by the Pentagon Papers.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Second Cairo Conference', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7534287'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'TAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7534759', 'text': 'Iino Domain\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIino Domain was created when a 7000 \"koku\" \"hatamoto,\" Hoshina Masasada was granted an additional 10,000 \"koku\" of territory in Settsu Province after his appointment as Justicar of Osaka in 1648.

The fertile, mostly flat land and Monocacy River were enticing to European immigrants and settlers moving west into the newly-opened Monocacy Hundred territory. Among these earliest settlers in the region were Henry and Josiah Ballenger, Sr., Quakers who moved into the Province of Maryland from the Colony of New Jersey. Members of the Ballenger family as well as the Davis Family who were also Quakers organized a Society of Friends at âMonoqueseyâ [Monocacy] and Meridith Davis donated land from his âGood Luckâ tract on which to build a meetinghouse in 1739. Though the meeting at Monocacy was short-lived, many of its early members moving into Virginia to join larger Quaker communities there, the Society of Friends near Buckeystown was among the first religious organizations effected within present-day Frederick County and western Maryland. During the American Revolutionary War period, brothers John and George Buckey settled on the old âGood Luckâ tract and initiated commercial and industrial establishments which led to the formation of the village. Much of the townâs growth in the 19th century was supported by the Baker family who purchased the Buckey tannery in 1832 and later founded the townâs cannery, Methodist Church, and an industrial school for boys.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nBuckeytown is located in southern Frederick County along Maryland Route 85, which leads north to Frederick, the county seat, and south to Maryland Route 28 near the Potomac River.

Primarily a superhero anthology, it ran eight issues from 1940 to 1942, and is notable for work by Carl Burgos, Bill Everett, Alex Schomburg, and the team of Joe Simon & Jack Kirby.\\n\\n\"Daring Mystery Comics\" #8 (Jan. 1942) features the first appearance of the Golden Age superhero Citizen V, who decades later appears in flashback in the Marvel series \"Thunderbolts\", where his family and the Citizen V identity play a major part. A small handful of other \"Daring Mystery\" superheroes have been revived or have made guest appearances in modern-day titles, such as the World War II-set flashback series \"The Invaders\" and the feature \"Liberty Legion\" in \"Marvel Premiere\".\\n\\nSection::::Publication history.\\n\"Daring Mystery Comics\" came from publisher Martin Goodman\\'s Timely Comics, which by the early 1960s would evolve into Marvel Comics. The first five issues were nominally edited by Goodman, but were in fact mixtures of material bought from Funnies, Inc. or the Harry \"A\" Chesler studio, both prominent comic-book \"packagers\" who produced stories or even complete, outsourced comics on demand for publishers entering the fledgling medium. Timely\\'s first in-house editor, Joe Simon, relaunched the series with issue #6 as his second project for Goodman and remained for the last few issues.\\n\\nFollowing \"Daring Mystery Comics\" #1-8 (Jan. 1940 - Jan. 1942) and a publishing hiatus, the series\\' numbering continued under different titles. In a quirk of publishing involving U.S. Postal Service regulations and mailing costs, and a World War II, paper-supply-related moratorium on launching new series, publisher Goodman somehow continued the series numbering as both \"Daring Comics\" for four issues from 1944 to 1945, and as \"Comedy Comics\" for 26 issues from 1942-1946, both of which launched with an issue #9.\\n\\nSection::::Characters.\\nAn anthology with no regular star, the series included a number of obscure, mostly single-appearance features. Due to Golden Age comics work often going unsigned, comprehensive credits are difficult if not impossible to ascertain, and in many early cases, a feature\\'s artist is also the uncredited writer.\\n\\nThe best known superheroes to debut in its pages were the Blue Diamond, by artist co-creator Ben Thompson; writer-artist Bill Everett\\'s the Fin; and the Thunderer, created by writer John H. Compton and notable for artist co-creator Carl Burgos. All three heroes were introduced in issue #7 (April 1941). In the 1970s, the Blue Diamond resurfaced in period stories in \"Marvel Premiere\", as a member of the homefront World War II team the Liberty Legion. He also appeared in writer Paul Jenkins\\' 2011 miniseries \"All-Winners Squad: Band of Heroes\" (2011). Two characters introduced here, writer-artist Joe Simon\\'s Fiery Mask, and writer Will Harr and artist Maurice Gutwirth\\'s Laughing Mask, who became the Purple Mask, appeared in present-day stories after awakening from suspended animation alongside 10 other Timely heroes in Marvel Comics\\' 2007-2008 and 2012 miniseries \"The Twelve\".\\n\\nOther heroes included the Challenger, drawn by Charles Nicholas Wojtkoski under the pseudonym Nick Karlton; Dynaman, by artist and possibly writer Steve Dahlman; and the superheroine the Silver Scorpion, created or co-created by artist and sometime-writer Harry Sahle using the pen name Jewell, which comics historian Michael J. Vassallo believes marked a collaboration with another, unknown artist.\\n\\nThe final three issues contained work by the commercially popular team of writer-inker Joe Simon and penciler and sometimes co-scripter Jack Kirby. They collaborated on the covers of #6 (July 1940) and #8 (Jan. 1942), the former of which also featured a 10-page Simon & Kirby story introducing the single-appearance superhero Marvel Boy (the first of several Marvel Universe characters to take that name), and 10-page story starring the previously introduced Fiery Mask. Issue #7 (April 1941) contained an eight-page Simon & Kirby story introducing the obscure Captain Daring (taken over for the next and last issue by artist Frank Borth, and continuing as Captain Dash in \"Comedy Comics\" #9). One of the first superhero parodies â Stuporman, by Harry Douglas who signed his name \"Harry / Douglas\" leading to much confusion and many theories over the possibility of two creators â debuted in issue #6 (Sept. 1940).\\n\\nNon-superhero features included \"G-Man, Don Gorman\", a single-issue cover character by unknown creators, though inked by future notable Dick Briefer; \"Soldier of Fortune, John Steele\" and \"Monako the Master Magician\" a.k.a. \"Monako, Prince of Magic\", both by artist co-creator Larry Antonette (under the pseudonym Dean Carr for \"John Steele\"); \"K-4 and the Sky Devils\", by uncertain creators; \"Whirlwind Carter of the Interplanetary Secret Service\", by writer-artist Fletcher Hanks; the jungle-lord adventure \"Trojak the Tiger Man\", by artist co-creator Joe Simon using the byline Gregory Sykes; artist co-creator Ben Thompson\\'s single-appearance Western \"Robin Hood of the Range\", featuring the first of two Marvel characters called the Texas Kid; and the college football-set \"Flash Foster at Midwestern\", by writer and artist Bob Wood.\\n\\nThe comic\\'s first five covers were by artist Alex Schomburg.\\n\\n\\nSection::::In other media.\\nThe Thunderer appeared in the \"Six Forgotten Warriors\" episode of one of the Spider-Man animated television series.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Daring Mystery Comics', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7543734'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7544160', 'text': 'St Thomas\\'s Abbey, Brno\\n\\nSt Thomas\\'s Abbey (or the KÃ¶nigskloster) is an Augustinian church located in Brno in the Czech Republic.

This was the early beginning of a long and significant musical tradition at the Brno monastery. In 1780s, the Emperor Joseph II forced the friars to move out because he liked their well-located and representative buildings.

VI, cap. XXX; Sess. XXII cap.ii, iii) that there is a purgatory, and that the souls therein are helped by the suffrages of the faithful, but principally by the acceptable Sacrifice of the Altar; the Holy Synod enjoins on the Bishops that they diligently endeavor to have the sound doctrine of the Fathers in Councils regarding purgatory everywhere taught and preached, held and believed by the faithful\" (Denzinger, \"Enchiridon\", 983).\\n\\nSection::::Various interpretations of the image.\\nThe Anima Sola is taken to represent a soul suffering in purgatory. While in many cases chromolithographs depict a female soul, many other figures such as popes and other men are commonly depicted in chromolithographs, sculptures and paintings. In the most commonly known image of the Anima Sola, a woman is depicted as breaking free from her chains in a dungeon setting surrounded by flames, representing purgatory. She appears penitent and reverent, and her chains have been broken, an indication that, after her temporary suffering, she is destined for heaven.\\n\\nPraying to the Anima Sola is a tradition in many ways unlike that of the more widespread cult of saints. In lieu of praying to a saint who then appeals to God, the Anima Sola represents souls in purgatory who require the assistance both of the living and the divine to ameliorate their sufferings in the afterlife.\\n\\nThe Anima Sola is common throughout much of the Catholic world, though is perhaps strongest in Naples, where it is referred to as \"the cult of the souls in Purgatory.\" In Latin America, one source reports, the Anima Sola is \"a belief still deeply rooted in the mass of the campesinos. The devotion dates from the first colonizers, who probably brought the image in which the soul is represented as a woman suffering torments in purgatory with chains binding her hands. A legend concerning the \\'thirst of Christ\\', about which Scripture seems to say nothing, passes from mouth to mouth: They say that in Jerusalem, there were women who gave drink to those who were being crucified. On the afternoon of Good Friday it fell to a young woman, Celestina Abdenago, to go up Calvary. From a jar she gave a drink to Dismas and Gestas, yet she despised the Saviour; and for that reason, he condemned her to suffer thirst and the constant heat of purgatory.\"\\n\\nSection::::Magical traditions.\\nAs with many Catholic symbols, the image is also appears in spiritist traditions. As described in \"The Element Encyclopedia of 5000 Spells\" by Judika Illes:\\n\\nAnother interpretation is that the sacred figures most frequently invoked include the \"Lonely Soul\" [Anima Sola], who requires prayers because of her predicament; San Silvestre, magical because of the date of his feast day; and Santa Elena and San Onofre.\\n\\nSection::::SanterÃ­a and Lukumi.\\nIn SanterÃ­a or Lukumi, the Afro-Caribbean religion of Cuba, there is a syncretization of the Anima Sola with the Eshu Alleguana. The Eshus are the Divine Messengers, the Tricksters, The Masters of the Roads and the Doors that are necessary for all prayers to reach their intended point. Eshu Allegwanna, one Eshu among hundreds, is thought to be the oldest of the Eshus, and to have existed on the Earth since a primordial time long before not only people, but before many of the gods of the religion, existed in the world. Therefore, he is synchronized with The Lonely Spirit, as many of the African Gods were synchronized with Catholic saints, or hidden behind them, in the first centuries of slavery, when the practice of the African religions were oppressed. Anima Sola is grouped in a triad in some traditions with The Intranquil Spirit and the Dominant Spirit.\\n', 'title': 'Anima Sola', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7545639'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7552733', 'text': 'LVS-86\\n\\nLVS-86 is a model of tramcar developed at the Leningrad Tram Manufacturing Plant in the former Soviet Union.

In an episode of \"Bo\\' Selecta!\", it was revealed that he used to have a problem, which caused him to shout out bad words at anyone. He has, however, broke the habit by thinking of women to take his mind off of it. After fantasizing about women, his tail will pop out.

He participated in the First Serbian Uprising, led Serbs in the Second Serbian Uprising, and founded the House of ObrenoviÄ. Under his rule, Serbia became an autonomous principality within the Ottoman Empire. Prince MiloÅ¡ ruled autocratically, permanently refusing to share power. During his rule, he was the richest man in Serbia and one of the richest in the Balkans.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nMiloÅ¡ TeodoroviÄ () was the son of Teodor \"TeÅ¡a\" MihailoviÄ (died 1802) from Dobrinja, and ViÅ¡nja (died 18 June 1817). This was the second marriage of his mother ViÅ¡nja, from which also sprung Jovan (1787â1850) and Jevrem (1790â1856). From ViÅ¡nja\\'s first marriage, with Obren MartinoviÄ (died 1780) from Brusnica, MiloÅ¡ had half-brothers Jakov (died 1811) and Milan (died 1810), and half-sister Stana. After the death of Obren, ViÅ¡nja moved from Brusnica and married Teodor in Dobrinja. After the death of his brother Milan, a famed revolutionary with great reputation among the people, MiloÅ¡ adopted the surname ObrenoviÄ. In official documents, his name was sometimes written MiloÅ¡ TeodoroviÄ ObrenoviÄ.\\n\\nSection::::First Serbian Uprising.\\nMiloÅ¡ fought in the First Serbian Uprising until its very end in 1813. His half-brother Milan also took part in the Uprising, rising to become the \"vojvoda\" (commander, duke) of the Rudnik district, until his death in 1810. After Milan\\'s death, MiloÅ¡ adopted the surname of his half-brother, ObrenoviÄ. This name was the patronymic which his half-brother derived from Obren, the first name of his own father (MiloÅ¡\\'s step-father). After the rebellion collapsed, MiloÅ¡ was among the few of its leaders that remained in Serbia to face the returning Ottomans.\\n\\nSection::::Second Serbian Uprising.\\nIn April 1815, Prince MiloÅ¡ organized and led the Second Serbian Uprising. After defeating the Turks, and Napoleon\\'s defeat in Russia, the Turks agreed to the terms of the agreement from 1815. After the killing of KaraÄorÄe PetroviÄ, in 1817, ObrenoviÄ became the leader of the Serbs. As a result of the agreement, Serbia gained some autonomy, but remained under Ottoman sovereignty. MiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ was left in power as its absolute ruler.\\n\\nBetween the end of 1828 and the autumn of 1830, Prince MiloÅ¡ created a so-called \"legislative commission\" to translate the Code NapolÃ©on into Serbian and codify the laws and customs of the country. After discussing the commission, MiloÅ¡ invited two distinguished legal specialists to come from Hungary to prepare a more suitable criminal and civil code of laws for Serbia. They were Vasilije LazareviÄ, \"BÃ¼rgermeister\" (mayor) of Zemun, and Jovan HadÅ¾iÄ, lawyer, poet, and member of the municipal senate of Novi Sad.\\n\\nIn January 1831, Prince MiloÅ¡ informed a great national assembly that he had obtained an imperial edict from the Sultan ending all direct obligations of Serbian peasants to their former Turkish lords, guaranteeing Ottoman recognition of Serbian autonomy in most matters of internal administration, and offering Serbia the prospect of territorial aggrandizement, as well as the express right to institute schools, courts, and a governmental administration of her own. The Sultan\\'s decrees of 1830 and 1833 expanded the same rights to a larger territory, and made Serbia a sovereign principality, with MiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ as hereditary prince. A Metropolitanate of Serbia was established in Belgrade as an autonomous unit of the Patriarchate of Constantinople. Russia\\'s status as the guarantor of Serbia\\'s autonomy was also recognized.\\n\\nSection::::Reign.\\nThe supporters of the rule of law often rebelled against MiloÅ¡\\'s government. Following one such rebellion, he agreed to adopt a constitution, the \"Sretenje\" or Candlemas constitution, in 1835. The move was opposed by neighboring Austria, the ruling Ottoman Empire and Russia. It is believed that the three great empires saw the constitution as a danger to their own autocratic systems of government. Metternich\\'s Austria particularly ridiculed the fact that Serbia had its own flag and foreign ministry. MiloÅ¡ abolished the constitution at the demand of Russia and Turkey, and it was replaced by the \"Turkish\" Constitution of 1838.\\n\\nMiloÅ¡ abdicated in 1839 in favor of his sonsâMilan, who died a few weeks later, and Mihailo, who then became prince. Mihailo was deposed in 1842, and the family was out of power until 1858, when it returned with MiloÅ¡ restored as prince for the last two years of his life.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nMiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ was given the epithet \"the Great\". He was proclaimed \"Father of the Fatherland\" by the National Assembly.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Marriage and children.\\nIn 1805, MiloÅ¡ married Ljubica VukomanoviÄ (September 1785 â Vienna, 26 May 1843). The couple had eight children whose names are known. It is speculated that Ljubica had other pregnancies that resulted in miscarriages, stillbirths, or children who died shortly after birth, with some sources giving a number as high as 17 pregnancies.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'MiloÅ¡ ObrenoviÄ', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=756514'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7567061', 'text': 'StebnÃ­cka Huta\\n\\nStebnÃ­cka Huta is a village and municipality in Bardejov District in the PreÅ¡ov Region of north-east Slovakia.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn historical records the village was first mentioned in 1600\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nThe municipality lies at an altitude of 505 metres and covers an area of 9.433\\xa0kmÂ².\\nIt has a population of about 255 people.\\n\\n', 'title': 'StebnÃ­cka Huta', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7567061'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7570968', 'text': 'St Oliver Plunketts/Eoghan Ruadh GAA\\n\\nSt. Oliver Plunkett Eoghan Ruadh (Irish: \"Naomh OilibhÃ©ar PluincÃ©ad, Eoghan Ruadh\" ) is a Gaelic Athletic Association club situated on the Navan Road on the Northside of Dublin, Ireland.

Mary Sampson was a devout member of the Church of England, and raised her daughter and Thomas\\' two children from a previous marriage in adherence to her faith. Few details are known about Elizabeth\\'s family or her early life, however, her autobiography sheds light on some aspects of her life. In her autobiography, which details her life from the time she was first married until the death of her second husband, Ashbridge reveals that when she was 14 years old, in 1727, she eloped without parental consent, only to become a widow after five months of marriage.\\n\\nUnwelcome at her parents\\' home, Ashbridge was sent to Dublin, Ireland; there, she resided first in Dublin with a relative of her mother and member of the Society of Friends, or Quakers. Upon finding life in accordance with his strict religious beliefs \"gloomy\", she moved to Ireland\\'s west coast, where she stayed with Catholic relatives.\\nSection::::Voyage to the U.S. and life in New England.\\nIn 1732 Ashbridge sailed to New York as an indentured servant, owned first by a woman in the slave trade and later by the ship\\'s captain. After completing three of the four years of servitude required to pay her passage to the colonies, she bought her freedom with money she earned performing odd jobs and sewing. With her new-found freedom she considered a career on the stage, even going so far as to befriend members of local playhouses and study scripts in her spare time; instead, she married a school teacher surnamed Sullivan.\\n\\nThe nature of Sullivan\\'s profession led the couple to travel widely throughout New England in search of schools in need of a schoolmaster. They settled briefly in Westerly, Rhode Island, where Ashbridge half-heartedly joined the Baptist church. After a failed attempt to travel to England, they moved to Boston in 1735, then back to Rhode Island later that year, where Ashbridge once again joined the Church of England. While visiting relatives in Pennsylvania, Ashbridge was taken with the Quaker faith, and became convinced, much to the disapproval of her husband. The couple stayed some time in Delaware, then moved on to Mount Holly, New Jersey, home of the influential Quaker John Woolman. Both Ashbridge and her husband taught school there. Her religious beliefs caused much turmoil in her marriage, and, in a drunken stupor, Sullivan enlisted himself as a soldier and left for Cuba in 1740. Later, claiming the Quaker\\'s right to pacifism, he was beaten brutally for his refusal to serve and died in a hospital near London in 1741. Her autobiography ends with Sullivan\\'s death.\\n\\nSection::::Indentured Servitude.\\nAs part of her journey to America, Elizabeth Ashbridge was eventually placed in a cruel household where she lived as an indentured servant. Since she was about to make her first transatlantic passage, Ashbridge was unaware of the dangers involved with an ocean voyage. One of those dangers was the threat of being taken as an indentured servant. Initially, Ashbridge thought a woman she was to accompany to America would be a kind \"Gentlewoman\" companion; however, before Ashbridge realized that her companion had malicious motives, she was kidnapped and kept aboard a ship for three weeks.\\n\\nFollowing her captivity, Ashbridge was still determined to travel to America, and she returned to the ship. Shortly after, Ashbridge learned that some Irish servants had planned a mutiny. In spite of her informing the ship\\'s captain of the planned attack on the crew, Ashbridge was forced into servitude: \"The captain caused an indenture to be made, and threatened me with a gaol, if I refused to sign it.\" Ashbridge lacked the travel funds to make her way across the Atlantic, and the captain took advantage of her misfortune.\\n\\nOnce in America, Ashbridge lived with a hypocritical master who outwardly demonstrated his religious practices; however, he was tyrannical and abusive toward his servant. In one instance, her master requests the service of the \"town whipper\" to discipline Ashbridge. Although his treatment is cruel, Ashbridge notes, in a moment of confident desperation, \"Then, fixing my eyes upon this barbarous man, I said, âSir, . . . if you think that I deserve such punishment, do it yourself.\" After three years of living under indentured servitude, Ashbridge was able to purchase her freedom by buying out the remaining terms of her contract. Her experience with such difficult circumstances prompted her to question her own belief in God: \"I became hardened and was ready to conclude that there was no God.\" Roxanne Harde examines criticism that suggests that Ashbridge\\'s denying of the master\\'s religious beliefs is an example of how this strong Quaker minister exercises Agency and finds her own religious voice. Ashbridge likely already knew the role her poor financial situation played in obtaining her contract of indentured servitude. Thus she became more financially empowered as a result of the difficult experiences in her master\\'s home. To survive, Ashbridge would sew, and she explains that \"when I had Served near three years, I bought off the remainder of my Time & then took to my needle, by which I could maintain my Self handsomely.\" \\n\\nSection::::Rebellion and Reconciliation with Patriarchy.\\nAt the beginning of \"Some Account of the Early Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge\", Ashbridge remarks that her father was absent from the Ashbridge household while she growing up. As a surgeon, Mr. Ashbridge \"made many long voyages\" and left young Elizabeth with her mother. As Ashbridge ages, her mother becomes a \"pattern of virtue\" for her to follow.\\n\\nAround the age of twelve, Ashbridge begins to feel conflicting emotions towards religion: she disregards religion, but also has an intense desire to be loved by the Lord. These emotions indicate that Ashbridge correlated \"the Lord\" with her absent father. She wants to be loved by these paternal figures and is angered that she does not feel such love. At the age of fourteen, Ashbridge rejects patriarchy by abruptly leaving her father\\'s house and entering into an improper marriage. After the death of her husband five months later, her father refuses to accept her back into his household. Her mother sends her to Dublin until she can re-gain her father\\'s affections. In this account, Ashbridge portrays her mother as a welcoming figure, and her father as a repulsive force.\\n\\nWhile away from her mother, Ashbridge becomes acquainted with a Catholic widow. She begins to associate this woman as her motherly role model and even begins to adhere to the Catholic faith. They spoke to each other freely about religion, with \"each of [them] defending [their] particular tenets.\" It was these conversations that made Ashbridge curious about Roman Catholicism; she was intrigued by the widow\\'s tales of \"such mighty miracles, done by their priests\" that Ashbridge \"began to be shaken in [her] own belief.\" Asbridge began to attend mass with the widow because, though interested, she was \"yet resolved not blindly to adopt their creed.\" She reaches the point of conversion, but speaking with the Catholic priest drives her away from the religion. Ashbridge\\'s tone towards the Roman Catholic belief system, though she almost converted, was mostly negative. She calls them \"papists,\" which was a widely used descriptor but was chiefly negative. While she was \"not averse\" to confessing her sins, she called the recital of beliefs the priest wanted her to swear by \"ridiculous\" and said they \"made [her] sick of [her] new intention.\" At this point in her spiritual journey, Ashbridge cannot adhere to a religion in which she feels directly influenced by the patriarchal system.\\n\\nAshbridge\\'s tendency to seek motherly figures is also shown when she naively trusts the \"gentlewoman\" who promises her passage to Pennsylvania. After realizing that this woman has betrayed her, Ashbridge refers to her as a \"vile creature.\" At this point in the autobiography, Ashbridge begins to portray women in all of their complexities. Once in America, Ashbridge remarries a man that she does not truly love. Though she never states the exact reason for the marriage, Ashbridge implies that there was some sort of superficial or physical connection that brought the two together.\\n\\nIn her marriage, she feels, once again, the repression of patriarchal rule. In a second blatant rebellion of patriarchy, Ashbridge steps outside of her marriage to pursue her spiritual convictions. In the Quaker religion, Ashbridge finds a sense of community, rather than a patriarchal hierarchy. The Quaker religion welcomed female speakers who were considered spiritually equal to their male counterparts. In this community, Ashbridge finds an escape from male-dominated society. As she continues to attend Quaker meetings, she ceases to associate the Lord with an absent male figure. In her final conversion experience, Ashbridge notes that a woman brings the invitation of salvation to her, as she states: \"â¦there stood a grave \"woman\", holding in her right hand a lamp burningâ¦[she] said, âI am sent to tell thee that, if thou wilt return to the Lord thy God, who created thee, he will have mercy on theeâ¦â\"\\n\\nSection::::Ashbridge\\'s Abusive Second Marriage.\\nAshbridge begins her account by informing the reader that her life has been characterized by hardships and evil, not least of which came at the hand of her second husband, Sullivan. Ashbridge enters the \"unaccountable\" marriage with a man she \"did not esteem\" shortly after being released from indentured servitude. Of her second marriage, she states, \"I released myself from one cruel servitude, and, in the course of a few months, entered into another for life,\" an unwise decision which left her to view herself as \"ruined\" She alludes to unhealthy marital relations from the beginning, andâdespite occasional periods of peaceâthe relationship was most often characterized by unhappiness and abuse. Whereas Ashbridge refers to her first husband as \"the darling of my heart\", she says of her second husband: \"I was in love with nothing I saw in him\". Although she describes feeling \"more affectionate\" toward Sullivan after being baptized and beginning to keep \"the true sabbath\", this positive statement is one of the very few contained in her autobiographical account. Frequently, Ashbridge relates being victim to verbal and emotional abuse by her husband. After he hears she has \"turned Quaker,\" for example, he tells her he would rather have heard she was dead and shortly thereafter flies \"into a rage\" at her for using the word \"thee\". In one particularly disturbing scene he demonstrates physical violence by forcing her to dance with him in front of a group of male friends, despite her resistance and weeping. Eventually, another man has to step in and tell Sullivan to \"let your wife alone\".\\n\\nAshbridge is determined to pursue her Quaker faith, but her husband does all in his power to prevent her. He refuses to let her take his horse to meetings, forcing her to walk the eight miles on foot. When her shoes wore out from so much walking, he refused her a new pair, thinking this would prevent her attendance at meetings. She relates: \"finding that all the means he had yet used could not alter my resolutions, he several times struck me with severe blows...Once he came up to me, took out his penknife, and said, \\'If you offer to go to meeting to-morrow, with this knife I\\'ll cripple you, for you shall not be a Quaker\\'\". Ultimately, she views her second marriage as \"the trial of [her] faith\". Fortunately, however, Sullivan eventually abandoned her to military service, died, and she was able to remarry a man who was much more understanding of her religious convictions and aspirations.\\n\\nSection::::Religion.\\nSection::::Spiritual Autobiography.\\nSometime between the death of her second husband in 1741 and her marriage to Aaron Ashbridge in 1746, Elizabeth Ashbridge recorded the story of her life with focus on her religious experiences and conversion to the Society of Friends. Titled \"Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge\", her spiritual and historical narrative is the source of the majority of present-day knowledge regarding her early life and religious beliefs. Few records exist regarding her life in colonial America prior to her activism in the Society of Friends. Even the original manuscript of her \"Account\" is not accounted for; most later editions are based on the first edition, published in 1774.\\n\\nChronologically, Ashbridge\\'s narrative begins with her childhood in England and her subsequent moves to Ireland and America, and ends with the death of her second husband. While dates and names are included in her narrative, much of it is dedicated to her religious experience and her acceptance of the \"true\" faith. The autobiography traces her childhood in the Church of England, her early experiences with Quaker and Catholic relatives, her brief foray into the Baptist church, and ends with her acceptance of and into the Society of Friends. Such documentation of spiritual and religious journeys were not uncommon among those of the faith at the time. John Woolman\\'s spiritual autobiography was very popular both within the Quaker church and throughout New England. Ashbridge\\'s narrative was first published posthumously in 1774 in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In later meetings, Ashbridge encounters William Hammons, a Quaker leader. He becomes the first male figure that Ashbridge notably holds in esteem. Ashbridge seems able to accept any person who comes on the ground of equality established within the Quaker community.\\n\\nSection::::Construction of Ashbridge\\'s Spiritual Autobiography.\\nWhile Ashbridge\\'s narrative, \"Some Account of the Fore Part of the Life of Elizabeth Ashbridge\", was not the first text to employ the emerging literary style of the spiritual autobiography, it did help to perpetuate the popularity of the format in the years following her narrative. Ashbridge was at the forefront of writers employing this literary strategy, and would have been conscious of its specific writing style, although she does not explicitly follow its structure verbatim. Her testimony narrates her exposure and acceptance of Quakerism, showing Ashbridge as not \"the victim of her fears and doubts, but as an opponent engaged in an extended struggle\", which she eventually overcomes. Traditionally, the format of a spiritual autobiography often follows four pre-established stages:\\n\\n\\nIn her own way, Ashbridge addresses each of these stages. As chronicled in the above section, her story begins with details of her youth, including the estrangement from her family due to her first marriage. She also recalls her struggles with religion, and her attempts to reconcile her identity within a certain denomination. This immediately draws reader focus into an awareness of focalization and Ashbridge\\'s internal struggle. The introduction of Ashbridge\\'s second marriage cues the second stage of her spiritual autobiography. Ashbridge writes shortly after accounting her second marriage that \"[her] mind was still not satisfied, with regard to religion. [She] had reformed her conduct, so as to be accounted, by those who knew [her], as a sober woman; yet [she] was not content\".\\n\\nIn an effort to settle her anxieties, Ashbridge again works to find her identity within religion. She eventually finds this identity within the practice of Quakerism, although she struggles initially to acknowledge herself as a Quaker. Ashbridge\\'s narrative climaxes with her dramatic acceptance and final conversation experience, as written in her narrative:Laying aside my prejudices, [I] opened my heart to receive the truth; the beauty of which was shown to me ... I had also revealed to me the emptiness of all shadows and types, which, though proper in their day, were now, by the coming of the Son of God, at an end, and everlasting righteousness ... was to be established in the room thereof. I was permitted to see that all I had gone through was to prepare me for this day.\\n\\nAlthough Ashbridge\\'s continues to struggle with her husband and his acceptance of her as a Quaker, she finds the religious contentment she so adamantly desired. Her narrative becomes not only a personal account of religious fulfillment, but also a key example of the style and development of the spiritual autobiography. The use of this literary structure would become common amongst writers of the time, creating widely popularized publications. Ashbridge, conscious of this growing trend, configured her own writings to loosely follow this format, but conceptually remained focused on narrating her attempt to overcome her internal struggle.\\n\\nSection::::Traveling ministry.\\nOn May 7, 1746, Elizabeth married Aaron Ashbridge, a well-known member of the Quaker community in Chester County, Pennsylvania. After becoming an authoritative speaker at the Goshen, Pennsylvania Quaker meetings, she appeared with other prominent Quakers such as John Woolman, Jane Fenn Hoskens, and Anthony Benezet at the General Spring Meeting of ministers and elders in Philadelphia in 1752. The signature on the roster, signed March 16, is the only surviving sample of Ashbridge\\'s handwriting. In 1753, she became a recorded minister of the church and, with the consent of her husband, traveled through England and Ireland speaking at meeting houses testifying to her spiritual journey.\\n\\nSection::::Later Years.\\nIn a note written by Aaron Ashbridge, it is revealed that Ashbridge remarried in 1746. After her marriage to Aaron, Ashbridge became a Quaker minister. In 1753, Ashbridge left for Ireland for a \"religious visit\", with the consent of her husband, where she would stay until her death in 1755. Her final days are recorded in an excerpt from a testimony of the National-Meeting of Ireland, concerning Ashbridge, which is included in the published copy of her autobiography.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nIn Cork, Ireland, Ashbridge fell sick with an unknown illness, attributing her poor health to \"bodily hardship in traveling\" and \"spiritual exercise in mind\". After several weeks she proceeded to Waterford, where she again fell ill. She spent three months indisposed at the home of fellow Quaker John Hutchinson. She then continued to Carlow County, where she lodged at the home of Robert Lecky, and died on May 16, 1755. She was buried three days later at the Ballybrumhill burial ground near Fennagh, County Carlow, Ireland.\\n\\nSection::::Contributions to Women\\'s Writing.\\nMany scholars have discussed Ashbridge\\'s contributions to women\\'s writing, some claiming that, to some extent, her \"\\'voice remains firmly indentured\\' to the patriarchal culture in which she lives,\" and others citing her as an example of \"the importance of life-writing as a tool for female vindication in a patriarchal culture.\" Her ability to \"embrace the interactions of minds, bodies, reason, and emotion\" in her writing is often noted as a feminist way of making meaning. While her conversion to Quakerism (a more gender-equal lifestyle and belief system than she was raised with) indicates a triumph over patriarchal society, the multi-faceted way in which she makes meaning marks an important contribution to women\\'s writing in itself. In addition, Ashbridge\\'s spiritual narrative gives us an example of a woman in Early America, not only constructing her \"self\" on her terms, but also asserting that construction of her \"self\" into the world and trying to find a way to reconcile the differences presented by her own construction of herself, and the construction of women presented to her by the patriarchal culture in which she lived.\\n\\nSection::::Notability.\\nAlthough Ashbridge is not the first writer of a spiritual autobiography or the first female Quaker minister, Ashbridge is still a notable figure in early American literature and history. Her \"Account,\" according to some critics, an interesting example of feminist literature and unique female voice. The Quaker\\'s belief that men and women are equally responsible for sharing their spiritual stories was somewhat unusual among the faiths present in New England in the eighteenth century. In this way, the Quaker community challenged the dominant culture: in fact, for a time Rhode Island was the sole state in which anti-Quaker legislation did not exist.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Elizabeth Ashbridge', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7580004'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7585058', 'text': 'Taiwan saddled carpetshark\\n\\nThe Taiwan saddled carpetshark (\"Cirrhoscyllium formosanum\") is a carpetshark of the family Parascylliidae found around Taiwan, between latitudes 28Â°N and 21Â°N, at depths to 110 m.

The federal government withdrew troops from the state and ended Reconstruction that year. Chamberlain was the last Republican in that office until James B. Edwards was elected in 1974.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nChamberlain was born in West Brookfield in Worcester County in central Massachusetts, the ninth of ten children born to Eli Chamberlain and Achsah Forbes. In 1862, he graduated with honors from Yale University, where he was a member of the Skull and Bones society.\\n\\nHe attended Harvard Law School, leaving in 1863 to serve as a second lieutenant in the United States Army with the Fifth Massachusetts Cavalry, a regiment of black troops. In 1866, Chamberlain moved to South Carolina to tend to the affairs of a deceased classmate.\\n\\nSection::::South Carolina politics.\\nIn 1868, Chamberlain entered politics as a delegate to the South Carolina state constitutional convention from Berkeley County. He served as state attorney general from 1868â1872 in the administration of Governor Robert K. Scott. After he failed to win the Republican nomination for governor in 1872, Chamberlain practiced law in Charleston. His partner later recalled that he worked hard for little compensation; whatever his ethics in office, he certainly had not amassed a fortune. In 1873, he was elected to the board of trustees of the University of South Carolina as the first black students were admitted and faculty hired for the institution.\\n\\nChamberlain was elected Republican governor on November 3, 1874, when he defeated John T. Green. Chamberlain received 80,403 votes (53.9%) to Green\\'s 68,818 votes (46.1%). Chamberlain\\'s reputation had been a dubious one; there certainly was evidence of a willingness to make his office pay, and possibly of corruption, in his earlier career. But by the time he became governor, he had become the representative of those Republicans convinced of the need for reformâa conviction strengthened by the notorious administration of his predecessor, Franklin J. Moses, Jr., and the national publicity given to \"The Prostrate State\", the exposure of South Carolina political conditions written by James Shepherd Pike.\\n\\nChamberlain delivered on his promises. While continuing his support of civil rights, he made war on government expenses and the high tax levels in the state. He tried to reduce all public officers\\' wages by a third and used his veto against tax rates that he considered too high. He urged that spending be cut for the lunatic asylum and that many of its inmates be shipped off to county poorhouses. Instead of paying so much for the penitentiary, he endorsed revival of the convict-lease system. There should only be half as much money for the agricultural college and an end to any state scholarship program. As for the state university, Chamberlain called for dismissing its faculty and replacing them with school teachers. \"We only want a good high school\", as he put it. His struggles over patronage pitted him against some of the leading African-American Republicans in the legislature and gave him a national reputation. It also made him deep enemies in the party. At one point, it was alleged, a senator rallied his colleagues: \"Are you going to let Chamberlain frighten you off with his cry of reform and economy? Why, gentlemen, there are five years of good stealing in South Carolina yet.\"\\n\\nEnjoying a close alliance with the Democratic editor of the \"Charleston News and Courier\", Chamberlain may have hoped for bipartisan support in his bid for re-election. It did not come. South Carolina Democrats chose to adopt a white-supremacy program, re-enforced with intimidation and the use of force against black Republican voters. The bitterly fought 1876 campaign was disrupted with mob violence and gunmen breaking up Republican campaign meetings. After Chamberlain informed President Ulysses S. Grant of the violent situation, Grant sent troops in October 1876 under General of the Army William T. Sherman to stop the violent mob action. On election night, his second term hinged on disputed votes from Laurens and Edgefield counties, where the counts greatly exceeded the total population. These overwhelmingly favored his opponent, ex-Confederate Wade Hampton, III.\\n\\nThrough the winter, Chamberlain and Hampton both claimed to lead the lawful government, but Chamberlain\\'s found it nearly impossible to raise the money or military force to function beyond the rooms in which it met. Chamberlain left South Carolina in April 1877 when President Rutherford B. Hayes withdrew Federal troops to barracks from their place protecting the Republican government and ended the interventions that had taken place intermittently in the state since the Civil War. Embittered, Chamberlain blamed the President for having betrayed the mass of South Carolina\\'s voters; the population was 58% African American. In later years, however, he grew disillusioned with Reconstruction and contended that letting black people vote had been a mistake.\\n\\nSection::::Later years.\\nChamberlain moved to New York City and became a successful Wall Street attorney. He was a professor of constitutional law at Cornell University from 1883 until 1897. Chamberlain authored the 1902 book \"Charles Sumner and the Treaty of Washington\", as well as numerous articles.\\n\\nUpon his retirement, he traveled extensively in Europe. He moved to Charlottesville, Virginia, where he died of cancer on April 13, 1907.

Born and educated in Germany, he was forced in 1935 to emigrate to Switzerland, which he adopted as his home country. His speciality was in the religious content of ancient art, which he interpreted from a perspective informed by the scientific tradition and shaped by the poetic tradition of the German classical period and the ideals of the poet Stefan George.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nAfter attending high school at the Eberhard-Ludwigs-Gymnasium in Stuttgart, he began his study of the ancient world at TÃ¼bingen and Heidelberg. He met his future wife, Marianne von den Steinen, there. He went on to study at Jena, and in 1930 completed his doctorate at Marburg under the supervision of Paul Jacobsthal. Later he worked especially at the German Archaeological Institute in Rome and Athens, and participated in excavations at Larisa in Thessaly.\\n\\nHe was married on 5 February 1935 to Marianne von den Steinen, daughter of Karl von den Steinen, a well-known ethnologist. Concerned by developments in Germany, he moved to Basel the same year, and there completed his \"Habilitation\" in classical archaeology. At first, he specialised in near-eastern and early-Christian archaeology. After the death of Ernst Pfuhl in 1940, he gradually became more and more responsible for all areas of teaching and finally, in 1953, the chair was transferred to him. He declined numerous appointments in other countries; through his research, and the foundation of a museum of antiquities, he developed the field of archaeology at Basel.\\n\\nSchefold was a member of the German, Austrian, and American archaeological institutes, and of the Bavarian and British Academy of Sciences. He held an honorary doctorate at the University of Thessaloniki. With Herbert A. Cahn he founded the Antikenmuseum Basel, the first museum for ancient art in Switzerland.\\n\\nHe had at three sons, Dian Schefold, Professor for public law in Bremen, Germany, Reimar Schefold, Professor for cultural anthropology, who lives in Amsterdam, Netherlands, and Bertram Schefold, Professor for Economics in Frankfurt, Germany.\\n\\nSection::::Work.\\nSchefold was known for his work on late-classical Attic vases, on the art of the Scythians in southern Russia, and his excavations at Larisa and Eretria.

For the period 1876â1892, he ranks behind only Cap Anson in career major league games played (1644), hits (2146), at-bats (6884), doubles (392) and total bases (2936), and behind only Harry Stovey in runs scored (1370) (Stovey was a younger player; Anson played five seasons and O\\'Rourke four prior to 1876.).\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nO\\'Rourke was born in East Bridgeport, Connecticut, and worked on his family\\'s farm while playing youth league and semi-pro baseball. He began his professional career as a member of the Middletown Mansfields in 1872, joining the one-year-old National Association team as a catcher. The Mansfields were not a top-tier team, and folded in August, but O\\'Rourke had impressed other teams sufficiently enough to be offered a contract with the Boston Red Stockings, with whom he played until 1878. On April 22, 1876, O\\'Rourke had the first base hit in National League history.\\n\\nHe graduated from Yale Law School in 1887 with an LL.B., practicing law in Bridgeport between early playing stints, and earning the nickname \"Orator Jim\" because of his verbosity on the field, his intellect, and his law degreeâuncommon in a game regarded as a rough immigrant sport at the time.\\n\\nAfter leaving the major leagues following the 1893 season he continued to play in the minor leagues until he was over 50 years old. As an executive of the Bridgeport team in the Connecticut League, in 1895 O\\'Rourke hired the first African American minor league baseball player in history.\\n\\nIn 1904, he made a final appearance with the New York Giants under manager and friend John McGraw, becoming at age 54 the oldest player ever to appear in the National League, and the oldest player to hit safely in a major league game. O\\'Rourke is one of only 29 players in baseball history to appear in Major League games in four decades.\\n\\nIn 1912, he returned to the field to catch a complete minor league game at the age of 60.\\n\\nO\\'Rourke died of pneumonia at age 68 in Bridgeport, Connecticut. He was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 1945 as one of the earliest inductees from the 19th century. His older brother John O\\'Rourke and his son James \"Queenie\" O\\'Rourke also played in the majors.\\n\\nOne legend concerning O\\'Rourke is that he was asked to drop the \"O\\'\" from his last name when he signed a contract with Boston and its Protestant backers. The son of Irish immigrants and the husband of a woman born in Ireland, O\\'Rourke refused, saying \"I would rather die than give up my father\\'s name. A million dollars would not tempt me.\"\\n\\nAnother legend about O\\'Rourke is that his signing by the Mansfields in 1872 was conditioned on the team finding someone to take over O\\'Rourke\\'s chores on his parents\\' farm.\\n\\nSection::::External links.\\n, or Retrosheet\\n', 'title': \"Jim O'Rourke (baseball)\", 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=759214'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'bQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '759514', 'text': 'Cowhill, Gloucestershire\\n\\nCowhill is a small village south of Oldbury, South Gloucestershire, England.

As part of the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde Acute Services Review, the centre is being centralised within new facilities at the Gartnavel General Hospital site.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Glasgow Cancer and Skin Institution, which had been founded at 400 St Vincent Street in 1886, acquired a house at 163 Hill Street in 1890. A ten-bed hospital was established to treat cancer patients. In 1893, Dr. George Beatson (who as Sir George Beatson KCB, KBE later served as President of the Scottish Red Cross Society), was appointed surgeon to the hospital. The following year, the Glasgow Cancer Hospital, the first of its kind in Scotland, was established, together with an outdoor dispensary, at 22 West Graham Street. A domiciliary nursing service was set up at the same time to care for cancer patients in their own homes.\\n\\nIn 1896 new premises, which could accommodate 30 beds, were acquired at 132 Hill Street. In the same year Beatson published his landmark paper in The Lancet, a report of three patients with breast cancer whom he had treated by bilateral oophorectomy. This work forms the basis of the current anti-hormonal treatment of breast cancer and the operation is still performed today. In 1912, HRH Princess Louise, Duchess of Argyll, opened the rebuilt facilities which were named the Royal Glasgow Cancer Hospital. In the same year a research department was founded and the first director of research (Dr. Charles Walker) was appointed, making the institute one of the oldest \"Comprehensive Cancer Centers\" in the world.\\n\\nWith the inception of the Scottish National Health Service (NHS) in 1948, the hospital came under control of the Western Board of Management, and was renamed the Royal Beatson Memorial Hospital in 1953. In 1967, the Research Laboratories were renamed the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research, which continued to occupy the upper floors of the hospital until 1977, when they moved to a new site at Garscube Estate (renamed the Beatson Institute for Cancer Research in 2013). The clinical section moved to a new centre within the Western Infirmary and was named the Beatson Oncology Centre.\\n\\nIn 2007, the Beatson Oncology Centre, which was by that time spread over four hospitals (Western Infirmary, Gartnavel General Hospital, Glasgow Royal Infirmary and Stobhill Hospital) moved to a newly built Cancer Hospital, The Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre.\\n\\nSection::::Support.\\nThe BWSCC was supported by charities Friends of the Beatson and The Beatson Oncology Centre Fund. In 2014 through a restructuring, and in partnership with NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde, the resources of both charities dedicated to supporting the Beatson West of Scotland Cancer Centre have combined to form a unitary charity to support and serve the Beatson.

Lightering is undertaken to reduce a vessel\\'s draft in order to enter port facilities which cannot accept very large ocean-going vessels. Lightering can also refer to the use of a lighter barge for any form of short-distance transport, such as to bring railroad cars across a river. In addition, lightering can refer to the process of removing oil or other hazardous chemicals from a compromised vessel to another vessel to prevent oil from spilling into the surrounding waters.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nLightering was practiced for all types of cargo for centuries. Prior to the 19th century introduction of steamships too large to enter some of the ports they intended to serve, in which case lightering became necessary to reduce the vessels\\' draft sufficiently to enter the port, cargoes ranging from water to ships\\'s stores (food, livestock, misc. supplies), to gunpowder and shot, were carried from dockside to sailing ships moored in harbors and roadways. Dredging, advances in dock construction, and containerization have reduced the frequency of the practice in dry bulk shipping after the middle of the 20th century. However, the practice remains in common usage in the oil tanking industry (\"wet\" cargo trade).\\n\\nSection::::Modern process.\\nSection::::Wet bulk.\\nLightering for tankers typically occurs in the EEZ, generally between and from the shore, and can be performed while the ships are at anchor, drifting, or underway. The product is typically transferred using specialized hoses which offload cargo from the larger vessel to the smaller. Fenders are used to separate the two ships moored to each other and prevent damage while the cargo is being transferred.\\n\\nSection::::Dry bulk.\\nIn many developing nations, such as China and especially India, dry bulk vessels still often lighter in order to meet draft restrictions at ports that either do not have natural deep water access or whose channels have yet to be dredged to sufficient depth to allow some of the larger-size bulk carriers to safely transit.\\n\\nIn dry bulk, lightering can be undertaken one of two ways. If the vessel to be lightered is geared, then it can discharge cargo to smaller, ungeared vessels (typically barges). If the vessel to be lightered is gearless, then floating cranes are often used to transfer cargo to another vessel or barge. A roll-on/roll-off discharge facility, a floating platform, can also be used to connect the vessels.\\n\\nAlso, although not very common, vessels will sometimes lighter before (or even between) berthings, shifting to shallower berths in order to discharge more quickly and also free up space for larger vessels.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Lightering', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7616809'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ewE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '761742', 'text': 'Fiesta Songs\\n\\nFiesta Songs is a 2003 album by SeÃ±or Coconut Y Su Conjunto (Uwe Schmidt).

The franchise is based on the idea of an alien EinsteinâRosen bridge device (the Stargate) that enables nearly instantaneous travel across the cosmos. The franchise began with the film \"Stargate\", released on October 28, 1994, by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer and Carolco, which grossed US$197\\xa0million worldwide. In 1997, Brad Wright and Jonathan Glassner created a television series titled \"Stargate SG-1\" as a sequel to the film. This show was joined by \"Stargate Atlantis\" in 2004, \"Stargate Universe\" in 2009, and a prequel web series, \"Stargate Origins\", in 2018. Also consistent with the same story are a variety of books, video games and comic books, as well as the direct-to-DVD movies \"Stargate: Children of the Gods\", \"\", and \"\", which concluded the first television show after 10 seasons.\\n\\nIn 2011, \"Stargate Universe\", the last \"Stargate\" program on television, ended its run. Brad Wright announced that there were no more plans to continue the same story in further productions. In 2016, comic publisher American Mythology acquired the rights to publish new \"Stargate Atlantis\" stories set within the established franchise canon. This was expanded in 2017 to include new \"Stargate Universe\" comics as well, resolving the cliffhanger that ended the show. The predominant story arc thus ran on television for 15 years, including 17 seasons (354 episodes) of programming, and 8 comic book issues as of July 2017. However, a variety of other media either ignore this main continuity or resets it, while maintaining essential elements that define the franchise (mainly, the inclusion of a Stargate device). These include the 2002 animated series \"Stargate Infinity.\"\\n\\nIn 2017, the franchise was revived with the announcement of a new prequel web series, \"Stargate Origins\". Episodes premiered on a central \"fan hub\" for the franchise called Stargate Command, with a first season of ten 10-minute episodes.\\n\\nSection::::Premise.\\n\"Stargate\" productions center on the premise of a \"Stargate,\" a ring-shaped portal that enables rapid transportation to other stargates located cosmic distances away. The story begins when one such device is discovered on Earth. The 1994 film and subsequent television series depict how the device is kept under the control of the United States government, who use it to conduct interplanetary missions by dialing the thousands of stargates located in the galaxy, which are the legacy of an ancient civilization. The expeditions originally had the goal of acquiring extremely rare resources, new technology and detecting threats; but often face scientific and humanitarian issues and the dilemmas of interacting with different societies. Finally they resulted in a unified \"United Nation\"-coalition to better support the constant need to continue the program to defend Earth from invading aliens.\\n\\nCombined with the notion that the Stargate is a secret, \"Stargate\" productions are notable for presenting no contradiction with reality, being set in the present day on an otherwise normal Earth, and being dominated by human interaction in the galaxy. In the story of the 1994 film, this is explained as being the result of forced deportations by aliens, with the suggestion that most ancient mythologies are the result of aliens posing as gods in the distant past (as in the unproven ancient astronaut hypothesis).\\n\\nThe longest-running series, \"Stargate SG-1\" sets the context having the \"Milky Way\" galaxy as a failed state in which Goa\\'uld System Lords war against each other, due to the death of Ra in the film undermining the existing social structure of the System Lords due to Ra\\'s status as the Supreme System Lord. Goa\\'uld used superior technology to pose as gods to the human populations who had been deported from Earth to everywhere in the galaxy (with evidence suggesting that most Goa\\'uld believe their propaganda); these people are kept in poverty, ignorance and slavery. The US Stargate Command represents simultaneously a higher level of civilization and a lower level of technology during conflicts. Only a small portion of stargate dial numbers do not lead to planets dominated by the Goa\\'uld.\\n\\nSection::::Franchise releases.\\nDue to multiple developers working separately and independently on the franchise over the years, the various \"Stargate\" productions are not entirely consistent with each other; and while no set of works forms an official canon, the largest following exists for the three live-action series. Through the work of various authors and developers, at least six separate story cycles can be discerned, some of which are continuations of the other ones (either endorsed or unendorsed by their predecessor).\\n\\n\\nSection::::Theatrical films.\\nSection::::\"Stargate\".\\nIn 1994, the military science fiction feature film \"Stargate\" was released, directed by Roland Emmerich and co-written by Emmerich and Dean Devlin. The film lays the foundation for all the Stargate productions that come after it, by explaining the notion, function, and history of the Stargate.\\n\\nThe film begins with the unearthing of the Stargate in Giza in 1928. In a present day, \"i.e.\", 1994, military base in Creek Mountain, Colorado, discredited Egyptologist Daniel Jackson (James Spader) enables use of the Stargate when he recognizes that symbols on the cover stones of the Stargate are asterisms used in a three dimensional coordinate system. A team led by Colonel Jack O\\'Neil (Kurt Russell) is ordered to step through the Stargate and identify potential military threats on the other side. Jackson accompanies them to operate the other Stargate with his knowledge of the coordinate system. The team discovers a slave civilization serving an alien who is posing as the Egyptian god Ra (Jaye Davidson). Ra and his minions have taken human form, dominating the slaves with brute force. With the help of the locals, O\\'Neil\\'s team is eventually able to instigate a slave rebellion, overwhelming Ra\\'s forces. Ra escapes in his mothership, but O\\'Neil is able to teleport a nuclear warhead on-board Ra\\'s ship in orbit and detonate it. With Ra dead, the civilization can live in peace; O\\'Neil and his team return home through the Stargate, but Daniel Jackson stays on the planet with a young local woman named Sha\\'uri.\\n\\nSection::::Other releases and possible future development.\\nAfter Bill McCay had written a series of five novels continuing the story the original creators had envisioned, and despite the success of the \"Stargate\" television series, Dean Devlin stated in 2006 that \"he has struck a production deal with MGM and is developing the long-delayed sequel feature films that will pick up the story from the 1994 original\" According to Devlin, two movie sequels would have picked up the story from the 1994 original, but not the mythology of the \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" series, with the original stars Kurt Russell and James Spader. Devlin regretted giving MGM control over the franchise. The first movie already tapped into Egyptian mythology; the second one would have moved into other mythologies; and the third would tie all the mythologies together. \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\" producer Brad Wright said in 2002 that \"Devlin can wish to do a sequel to \"Stargate\" all he wants. MGM owns the rights, and I doubt very much that they\\'ll ask him to do it. He knows better.\"\\n\\nPlans for producing two sequels of the original film were announced by the original film\\'s creator Dean Devlin at the 2006 San Diego Comic-Con. He was in talks with MGM to produce four films and he wanted two of them to be the final two films in his envisioned Stargate trilogy. In an interview with Sci Fi Wire, Devlin said that should the sequels be made, he hoped to enlist Kurt Russell and James Spader in the two sequels. Both Russell and Spader expressed interest, Devlin revealed. \"They\\'ve always said they wanted to do it. The irony is actually because it was 12 years ago that we made Stargate, [and] part two was actually supposed to take place about 12 years later. We were just going to kind of age them up as actors. So it actually works out really nicely.\" These sequels would bypass the 12 years of mythology created by \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" if they are ever produced.\\n\\nDean Devlin spoke out again on July 4, 2011 stating that he hadn\\'t given up on the idea of sequels to his 1994 feature film. He talked about the idea again in a new interview with Collider. Devlin actually wrote it as a trilogy of movies, but was never able to do parts two and three. His hope was, as the series started to wind down, that perhaps it would be time to actually get to do parts two and three.\\n\\nDevlin has said \"I think it\\'ll change a little bit from our original idea since so many years have passed.\" \"We wanted to explore the idea of how the Stargates were built originally, and where else in the universe they exist, and why they exist â and where else they exist on Earth. We had really planned out, as a trilogy of films, to allow this mythology to grow bigger and bigger.\" It was announced that MGM and Warner Bros. are partnering with both Emmerich and Devlin for a reboot of Stargate as a trilogy with Emmerich directing and Devlin producing. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot of a potential new series are stalled.\\n\\nSection::::Television.\\nSection::::\"SG-1\".\\nIn 1997, Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright co-developed \"Stargate SG-1\", a television series intended to continue the story laid down by the original film. Although new actors were cast, several roles from the film were reprised, including the main characters Daniel Jackson and Jack O\\'Neill (which was re-spelled to include an extra \"L\"). The Stargate Command setting was transferred from a fictional military facility located in Creek Mountain, to the Cheyenne Mountain Complex. Other variations and differences between the original film and \"SG-1\" mostly concern the location of the planet Abydos, the alien Ra, the race of Ra\\'s underlings (Jaffa), and Stargate travel.\\n\\nThe series debuted on Showtime on July 27, 1997, and moved to the Sci-Fi Channel after its fifth season. It starred Richard Dean Anderson (as O\\'Neill) and Michael Shanks (as Jackson), alongside Amanda Tapping, Christopher Judge and Don S. Davis respectively playing the new characters Samantha Carter, Teal\\'c and George Hammond. The cast remained fairly regular for most of \"SG-1\"\\'s run, but experienced some changes. Michael Shanks left the show at the end of Season 5 and was replaced by Corin Nemec as Jonas Quinn. Shanks returned at the beginning of Season 7 and Nemec was written out. At the end of Season 7 Davis left the show and Anderson filled the gap he left in the story. Season 9 saw the departure of Anderson, but added new regulars Beau Bridges and Ben Browder. After a debut episode in Season 8, followed by appearances in eight episodes of Season 9, Claudia Black\\'s popular reception earned her a position in the regular cast in Season 10.\\n\\nMGM put an average of $1,400,000 into each episode of the show, and regards it as one of its most important franchises. \"SG-1\" was taken off air in 2007; however, two direct-to-DVD movies entitled \"The Ark of Truth and Stargate Continuum\" were made to tie up loose ends.\\n\\nIn June 2009, \"Children of the Gods\", \"Stargate SG-1\"\\'s pilot episode, was re-cut into a \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD movie with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version.\\n\\nSection::::\"Atlantis\".\\nThe \"Stargate Atlantis\" series follows the adventures of the \"Atlantis expedition\", a combination of military forces and civilian scientists that travel to the Pegasus Galaxy in search of the Lost City of Atlantis, left behind by the most powerful race known to ever have lived, referred to as the Ancients, also known as Lanteans and Alterans. The finding of the city had been a plot arc for most of \"SG-1\"\\'s Season 7, and the Ancients themselves had been a long-running facet of the \"SG-1\" setting. Arriving at the City, the expedition discovers Atlantis rests at the bottom of an ocean, protected by shields keeping the City habitable. As the Atlantis Expedition Team explores the myriad corridors and equipment, they quickly drain the already nearly depleted power source (known as a ZPM) allowing the shields to hold and Atlantis remain watertight. As an emergency default \"programme\", Atlantis detects this sudden power drop, activates a failsafe, the City surfaces, and appears as an island in the middle of an ocean.\\n\\nUsing small ships discovered in the City, Team Members fly and discover the mainland, where they explore, meet the Indigenous Population, and learn that the Pegasus Galaxy is dominated by a terrible enemy known as the \"Wraith.\" Although first encountered whilst in a long-term hibernation state, the Expedition unintentionally and prematurely wakes the Wraith, alerting them to the reemergence of Atlantis, a new race of humans, and a potential new feeding ground: The Milky Way Galaxy. Despite being vastly outnumbered, the Team must defend and protect the City, the Locals, and the entire Expedition. \\n\\n\"Stargate Atlantis\" was a spin-off television series from \"Stargate SG-1\". A new feature film was originally intended to transition the two series after the sixth season of \"SG-1\". Later, \"SG-1\" was renewed for a seventh season, and the feature film was then planned to transition that season. Finally, when \"SG-1\" was renewed for an eighth season, the intended film instead became the two-part season finale episode \"Lost City\", and the setting of \"Stargate Atlantis\" was moved to the Pegasus galaxy. This allowed the two shows to exist side-by-side within the same fictional universe, and later the two shows even become interconnected. \"Atlantis\" was developed by most of the same people and in the same studios as \"SG-1\".\\n\\n\"Atlantis\" debuted on the Sci-Fi Channel on July 16, 2004, starring Joe Flanigan and Torri Higginson in the lead roles, with Rainbow Sun Francks, David Hewlett, and Rachel Luttrell alongside. Hewlett and Higginson\\'s characters had previously appeared in \"SG-1\" (though Higginson inherited the role from actress Jessica Steen). In \"Atlantis\"\\' second season, Paul McGillion and Jason Momoa (replacing Francks) were added as regulars. At the end of the third season, Higginson and McGillion were removed as regulars, both serving recurring roles in the 4th season. Season 4 brought in Amanda Tapping, reprising her role as Samantha Carter from SG-1, and Jewel Staite in a recurring role. Tapping left the show for season five to concentrate on \"Sanctuary\", and was replaced by Robert Picardo, who reprised his role as Richard Woolsey from both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\". However, in late summer 2008 it was announced that SciFi would not renew \"Atlantis\". The final episode aired on January 9, 2009.\\n\\nSection::::\"Universe\".\\n\"Stargate Universe\" is the third live-action \"Stargate\" series, and premiered on October 2, 2009. The series was pitched to the Sci Fi Channel in the fall of 2007, just before the writer\\'s strikeâwhich put a hold on the project. \"The pitch was received very well,\" according to Stargate Atlantis co-creator Brad Wright. Sci Fi Channel ordered \"Universe\" after announcing the cancellation of \"Stargate Atlantis\". Syfy announced on December 16, 2010 that they would not pick the show up for a third season. The final episode aired May 9, 2011.\\n\\nAfter the events of \"Stargate Atlantis\", research into the Stargate\\'s 9th and final chevron leads to an expedition being stranded several billion light years from earth on board an Ancient ship called \"Destiny\" which has been traveling through the universe unmanned for millions of years. The show follows the crew as they struggle to survive on board \"Destiny\" with no apparent way home. The show was intended to have a darker tone than its predecessors and delve more into the humanity of the characters and their relationships with each other.\\n\\nSection::::\"The Ark of Truth, Continuum & Children of the Gods\".\\n\"\" is a direct-to-DVD movie written and directed by Robert C.

The movie was released on DVD and Blu-ray Disc on July 29, 2008. The Region 4 DVD was released on August 6, 2008 with the Region 2 DVD released on August 18, 2008; followed by possible TV broadcasts. The film is a time-travel adventure and is the second sequel to \"Stargate SG-1\", after \"Stargate: The Ark of Truth\".\\n\\n\"Stargate: Children of the Gods\" is a direct-to-DVD movie written by Jonathan Glassner and Brad Wright and directed by Mario Azzopardi.\\nThe \"Stargate SG-1\" pilot episode was re-cut as a third \"Stargate SG-1\" direct-to-DVD special and released on July 21, 2009 in format. A few months before its release, executive producer Brad Wright announced it was to have with brand new visual effects and scenes not previously included in the television version. The beginning was to be slightly altered, a new scene added, and the nudity scene taken out to make this episode suitable for children, with the final movie roughly seven minutes shorter than the original episode.\\n\\nSection::::Post-\"Universe\" cancellation.\\nIn April 2009, MGM confirmed a third \"SG-1\" film that Brad Wright had first announced in May 2008. Wright was set to co-write the film with former \"Stargate Atlantis\" executive producer Carl Binder, with Martin Wood serving as director. According to Wright, the film would center on the Jack O\\'Neill character and reunite as many of the \"SG-1\" cast as possible, depending on the cost of the film and actor availability. Michael Shanks (Daniel Jackson) had confirmed his and Richard Dean Anderson\\'s participation. Amanda Tapping confirmed her appearance in the third SG-1 film and the first \"Atlantis\" movie. According to Wright, the character of Vala Mal Doran would not appear in this film. The working title for the film, \"\" was revealed by Joseph Mallozzi in his blog.\\n\\nAccording to Sci-Fi and Joseph Mallozzi, a \"Stargate Atlantis\" two-hour direct-to-DVD movie was given the go ahead after the series was cancelled at the end of its fifth season. More movies were expected to follow in the Atlantis series if the first movie was successful. The rumored working title for the film was \"Stargate Extinction\". By May 2009 the script for the film was finished.\\n\\nOn April 17, 2011, \"Stargate\" writer and executive producer Brad Wright announced that the \"SGU\" movie is not going to happen. He also confirmed that the proposed \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" movies have been permanently shelved, along with another movie idea he had been trying to get a greenlight on that would have involved cast members of all three series. Still, Wright did not rule out future \"Stargate\" films, saying; \"It\\'s a franchise. \"Stargate\" is not over. Somebody smart from MGM is going to figure it out, and something will happen.\"\\n\\nIn May 2014, MGM announced a re-imagined version of the original 1994 film to be produced as a trilogy with Warner Bros. Pictures. Emmerich will direct and Devlin will produce. This set of two sequel films to the original \"Stargate\" starring Kurt Russell and James Spader will take a dramatically different course than the \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" universe created in the following 15 years. On November 17, 2016, Devlin told Empire Online that the plans to make a reboot and potential new series are stalled.\\n\\nSection::::\"Stargate Origins\".\\nIn July 2017, a web series called \"Stargate Origins\" was announced at a San Diego Comic Con Panel celebrating the franchise\\'s 20th anniversary. It focuses on the character of Catherine Langford and is a prequel to both the television continuity and the original feature film. The shooting began in August 2017 and series premiered online at the Stargate Command website on February 14, 2018.\\n\\nThe cast includes Ellie Gall as the young Catherine Langford, Connor Trinneer as Catherine\\'s father, Professor Paul Langford, Aylam Orian as Dr. Wilhelm BrÃ¼cke, a high-ranking Nazi officer, Philip Alexander as Captain James Beal, British officer stationed in Egypt., and Shvan Aladdin as Wasif, a native Egyptian and a lieutenant in the British army.\\n\\nSection::::\"Infinity\".\\n\"Stargate Infinity\" is an American animated science fiction television series created by Eric Lewald and Michael Maliani as a spin-off from its sister show, \"Stargate SG-1\". The story arc in \"Infinity\" is set 30 years into the future and follows Gus Bonner and his team. Bonner\\'s team was created after he was framed for a crime he did not commit. He escaped from Stargate Command (SGC) after the hostile alien race Tlak\\'kahn attacked the SGC to find the chrysalis. Together with his team he escapes through the Stargate with the chrysalis. From that point forward they go from planet to planet until they find the evidence to clear their names while learning about the unique cultures in the galaxy, so that they can one day return to Earth. The story arc was never resolved because of low viewership ratings and the show was cancelled in 2003.\\n\\n\"Stargate Infinity\" premiered in September 2002 as part of 4Kids Entertainmentâs FOX BOX Saturday morning line-up on FOX and went off the air in June 2003. Due to its lack of popularity the show is almost completely unrecognized. The series was cancelled before any of its story arcs could be resolved. The show was of low budget, which was constantly noted by the media. DIC Entertainment released a 4-episode DVD on October 7, 2003 in Region 1. MGM Home Entertainment released a five disc season box set on August 13, 2007 in region 2. Shout! Factory, a company known for releasing cult animated series, acquired the rights to the show and released the entire series to DVD on May 13, 2008 in Region 1. , there is yet to come a release of \"Stargate Infinity\" package in Region 4, namely Oceania and Latin America.\\n\\nThe writers and producers of \"Stargate SG-1\", \"Stargate Atlantis\" and \"Stargate Universe\" and the main canon of the \"Stargate\" franchise were not involved with \"Infinity\", and neither MGM, the production teams nor the fans of \"Stargate\" consider \"Infinity\" to be an official part of the \"Stargate\" universe. According to \"Stargate SG-1\" co-creator Brad Wright, the animated series should not be considered official \"Stargate\" canon. Commenting on it, he stated, \"I don\\'t have a problem with it. I\\'m just not involved.\"\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\n\"Stargate\" took in $16.7\\xa0million on its opening weekend, and received mixed reactions from critics; while it was panned by some critics such as Roger Ebert, several positive reviews counterbalanced this leading to a score of 46% on Rotten Tomatoes. Although the film was originally intended as the first of a trilogy of films, Emmerich and Devlin ultimately moved on to produce \"Independence Day\", and it was not until 2006 that Devlin showed renewed interest in developing sequels. In the intervening time, copyright-holder MGM succeeded the film with the television series \"Stargate SG-1\" without the input of Emmerich and Devlin.\\n\\n\"Stargate SG-1\" has won the Saturn Award for \"Best Syndicated Television Series\" on numerous occasions, and its cast has won similar awards for acting. More recently it has received acclaim for its visual effects, which increased in quality and realism as the show gained a larger budget. On August 21, 2006, the Sci Fi Channel announced that it would not be renewing \"Stargate SG-1\" for an eleventh season after a series of poor performances in the Nielsen ratings. Many fans were enraged at the news, even creating websites in reaction to exhibit their commitment to the series. Spokesmen for the production have said all options for the continuation of \"SG-1\" are being considered, including complete digital broadcasting. Executive producer Robert C. Cooper told the fansite GateWorld exclusively that he was working to continue \"SG-1\". Currently, no network or company has ordered new episodes of \"SG-1\", so the show is on hold until a new buyer can be found. However, SciFi has attempted to block other networks from taking up the show, citing its original exclusive contract with MGM. \"Atlantis\" proved to be as successful as \"SG-1\", with Nielsen ratings and viewership. The \"Stargate\" franchise in 2009 won a Constellation Award in the category of Outstanding Canadian Contribution to Science Fiction Film or Television in 2008.\\n\\nThe average viewership to \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" was around 10\\xa0million a week worldwide. According to \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\" co-creator Brad Wright, the show is popular in Great Britain, Germany, France and Australia, but with a steadily declining viewership in homeland Canada. It was estimated that around 30\\xa0million \"Stargate\" DVDs were sold worldwide in 2006.\\n\\nThe DVD release of \"\" in the US earned MGM/Fox US $1.59\\xa0million in rentals in the first week after the release, and another US $1.38\\xa0million in rentals in the second week. In its third week it earned US $1.19\\xa0million in rentals totaling US $4.16\\xa0million. The DVD has also earned US $9.0\\xa0million in sales. \"\" would go on to gross over $8\\xa0million United States dollars in the United States. The film sparked mostly positive reviews with movie critics. A third \"Stargate SG-1\" movie was planned to follow \"Continuum\", but the third movie was put on hold with any other future Stargate movies; the film would have centered around the character of Jack O\\'Neill.\\n\\nSection::::Literature.\\nThere are three series of novels based on the Stargate franchise, one based on the original \"Stargate\" film and two based in the \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\" television shows. A series of books written by Bill McCay were published from 1995 to 1999 that were unofficial sequels to the film. These were produced by consulting the original notes made by Dean Devlin and Roland Emmerich, in an attempt to envision where the film \"would have gone\". Neither party has commented on whether McCay\\'s interpretation was correct. Despite attempting to remain close to the original vision, the subsequent television series \"Stargate SG-1\" (which began under an entirely independent development) developed the story along different lines, making no attempt to reconcile the plot lines of the books. This marked the first major branching of the franchise.\\n\\nFrom 1999 to 2001, ROC published four novels based in \"Stargate SG-1\" written by Ashley McConnell. In 2004, UK-based Fandemonium Press started a new series of licensed tie-in novels based on \"Stargate SG-1\". Due to the conflict with ROC\\'s license, these books were available in Australia, Canada, New Zealand, South Africa and the UK, but not in the US. Fandemonium books became available in the US in 2006. The official \"Stargate Magazine\", produced by Titan Publishing, began publishing short stories written by Fandemonium authors in their 8th issue. The stories alternate between both \"SG-1\" and \"Atlantis\".\\n\\nA series of comic books, based on \"Stargate SG-1\" and \"Stargate Atlantis\", began to be published by Avatar Press in 2003. Five have been published to date, with stories by James Anthony and artwork by Jorge Correa. In February 2008 it was announced that Big Finish Productions would release officially licensed audiobooks featuring members of the cast reading new stories. The first two stories, available on CD and digital download, are \"Gift of the Gods\" read by Michael Shanks and \"A Necessary Evil\" read by Torri Higginson.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Stargate', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=762849', 'cat_id': '762849', 'cat_title': 'Destroyers_of_the_Royal_Norwegian_Navy', 'cat_pages': '10', 'cat_subcats': '6', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'fwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '763125', 'text': 'Kronstadt\\n\\nKronstadt ( ), also spelled Kronshtadt, Cronstadt or KronÅ¡tÃ¡dt (from for \"crown\" and \"Stadt\" for \"city\"; ) is an early 18th-century foundation which became an important international centre of commerce whose trade role was eclipsed by the growth of its strategic significance in the ensuing centuries as the primary maritime defence outpost of the former Russian capital. It is now the port city in Kronshtadtsky District of the federal city of Saint Petersburg, Russia, located on Kotlin Island, west of Saint Petersburg, near the head of the Gulf of Finland. It is linked to the former Russian capital by a combination levee-causeway-seagate, the St Petersburg Dam, part of the city\\'s flood defences, which also acts as road access to Kotlin island from the mainland. In March 1921, the island city was the site of the Kronstadt rebellion.\\n\\nThe main base of the Russian Baltic Fleet was located in Kronstadt guarding the approaches to Saint Petersburg. The historic centre of the city and its fortifications are part of the World Heritage Site that is \"Saint Petersburg and Related Groups of Monuments\".\\n\\nKronstadt has been a place of pilgrimage for Orthodox Christians for many years due to the memory of Saint John of Kronstadt.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Foundation.\\nKronstadt was founded by Peter the Great, whose Imperial Russian forces took the island of Kotlin from the Swedes during the Great Northern War in 1703. The first fortifications were inaugurated on . These fortifications, known as (ÐÑÐ¾Ð½ÑÐ»Ð¾Ñ), were constructed very quickly. During the winter the Gulf of Finland freezes over completely. Under the command of Governor-general Alexander Danilovich Menshikov, workers used thousands of frames made of oak logs filled with stones which were carried by horses across the frozen sea, and placed in cuttings made in the ice. Thus, several new small islands were created, and forts were erected on them, virtually closing access to Saint-Petersburg by sea. Only two narrow navigable channels remained, with forts guarding them.\\n\\nOne of the first Governors of Kronstadt was a veteran of the Royal Scots Navy, Admiral Thomas Gordon who was a refugee in Russia from the Scottish union with England and became Commander-in-chief from 1727 to 1741.\\n\\nJust as Kronstadt became populated and fortified, it attracted merchants from maritime powers most notably, the Dutch, the British and the Germans through the old \"Hanse\" connections. The community of British merchants or \"factors\" came to be known as the \"English Factory\", despite the fact that many of them were Scots. They settled both in Kronstadt and in St Petersburg itself and for a time dominated both inward and outward trade, especially in the reign of Catherine the Great. They became an integral part of British trade and foreign policy through the Board of Trade in London. A number of the British settlers became naturalised Russians. Trading alliances were sharply interrupted by the outbreak of the Crimean War (1854).\\n\\nKronstadt was thoroughly refortified in the 19th century. The old three-decker forts, five in number, which formerly constituted the principal defences of the place and had resisted the Anglo-French fleets during the Crimean War, became of secondary importance. From the plans of Eduard Totleben a new fort, \"Constantine\", and four batteries were constructed (1856â1871) to defend the principal approach, and seven batteries to cover the shallower northern channel. All these fortifications were low and thickly armoured earthworks with heavy Krupp guns on their ramparts. The city is surrounded by an enceinte.\\n\\nIn summer 1891, the French fleet was officially received in Kronstadt. It was a first step towards the forthcoming Franco-Russian Alliance.\\n\\nSection::::Russian Civil War.\\nDuring the Petrograd (now Saint Petersburg) riots of the February revolution, the sailors of Petrograd joined the revolution and executed their officers, thus gaining a reputation as dedicated revolutionaries. During the civil war, the sailors participated on the \"red side\", until 1921, when they rebelled against Bolshevik rule.\\n\\nKronstadt with its supporting forts and minefields was key in protecting Petrograd from foreign forces. Despite this, the cruiser \"Oleg\" was torpedoed and sunk by a small motor boat after participating in the bombardment of Krasnaya Gorka fort that had revolted against the Bolsheviks. This was followed on August 18, 1919, by a raid of seven Royal Navy Coastal Motor Boats inside the harbour of Kronstadt itself, damaging the Soviet battleships and \"Andrei Pervozvanny\", and sinking a submarine supply ship, the .\\n\\nSection::::Kronstadt Rebellion.\\nIn 1921, a group of naval officers and men, together with soldiers and civilian supporters, rebelled against the Bolshevik government in Soviet Kronstadt. The garrison had previously been a centre of major support for the Bolsheviks, and throughout the Civil War of 1917â1921, the naval forces at Kronstadt had been at the vanguard of the main Bolshevik attacks. Their demands included freedom of speech, the end of deportation to work camps, a change in Soviet war politics, and liberation of the soviets (workers\\' councils) from \"party control\". After brief negotiations, Leon Trotsky (then the Minister of War in the Soviet Government, and the leader of the Red Army) responded by sending the army to Kronstadt, along with the Cheka. The uprising was thus suppressed.\\n\\nSection::::World War II.\\nIn the late 1930s, the fortified city became the base of the Soviet Baltic Fleet. During that time it was an important training centre for the Soviet navy. The Kronstadt naval dockyard overhauled and repaired surface ships and submarines for the Baltic Fleet. All forts and batteries of the city were reconstructed.\\n\\nAt 23:37 on June 21, 1941, fleet operational readiness Number 1 was announced by Baltic Fleet Commander Vice Admiral V. Tributs on the order of the People\\'s Commissar of the Navy Admiral N.G. Kuznetsov. Several hours later the first German aircraft began dropping mines into the canal outside Kronstadt. The duty officer, first lieutenant S. Kushnerev, ordered anti-aircraft batteries to open fire on enemy planes. Several aircraft were shot down or damaged. Twenty-seven German planes took part in the first attack, and three were destroyed by the anti-aircraft guns of the 1st Air Defence Regiment of the Baltic Fleet. This regiment was situated in the southern forts.\\n\\nDuring World War II, Kronstadt was subject to several bombing raids by the Luftwaffe. In August 1941 the Luftwaffe began bombing Kronstadt repeatedly. The most notable bombing was Stuka ace Hans-Ulrich Rudel\\'s sinking of the \"Marat\".\\n\\nTo prevent an enemy landing, 13 artillery batteries were established in Kronstadt with nine more batteries outside the city, on the island of Kotlin. The main lookout was located in the \"Naval Cathedral\". Visual range reached . The coastal defence forces of Kronstadt included two infantry regiments.\\n\\nIn late August, the Red Army in the Baltic States was in a critical situation. Tallinn, the main base of the fleet, was in danger and an order to relocate the fleet from Tallinn to Kronstadt was given. By the time the Soviets had decided on a maritime evacuation of Tallinn, over 200 Soviet civilian and military vessels had been assembled in Tallinn harbour.\\n\\nAfter the evacuation of Tallinn, a submarine subdivision had been organized in Kronstadt. By the end of 1941, 82 naval operations had taken place. Hitler was enraged, because Soviet submarines frequently disrupted military supplies of strategic materials from Sweden to Germany. The Germans tried to block the exit completely from the Gulf of Finland with anti-submarine nets and mines. Despite these efforts, the Soviet submariners continued to attack German ships. In 1942, 29 German vessels were sunk. Submarines cooperated with reconnaissance aircraft in searching for military targets.\\n\\nSoviet submarines had broken through the mine barrages in the Gulf of Finland in 1942. To keep the Soviet submarine force away from Baltic shipping stronger efforts were planned. The minefields would be larger and in addition a double submarine net would be laid from Porkkala to Naissaar in \"Operation Walross\". The blockade of the Gulf of Finland turned out to be 100% effective. But in 1944, when Finland signed a peace treaty with the Soviet Union, one of the conditions was that the Soviets could locate one naval base in Finland at Porkkala. Submarine warfare in the Baltic Sea reached its final stage after peace was reached with Finland.\\n\\nThe Baltic Fleet sent more than 125,000 people to serve on shore at the front. Eighty-three thousand people fought directly on the Leningrad Front. For the protection of Leningrad 10 brigades of marines, four regiments, and more than 40 separate battalions and companies were formed in Kronstadt.\\n\\nThe Luftwaffe and German artillery sent thousands of bombs and shells onto the naval dockyard and the Arsenal factory. The German air raids in September 1941, damaged ships of the Baltic Fleet and the infrastructure of the naval dockyard. Several sections of the yard were destroyed, the docks were heavily bombed causing the death of dozens of workers and engineers. Nevertheless, the naval yard continued its work. Despite the siege, the workers persevered with their work, often working 18â20 hours a day.\\n\\nThanks to the power of the Kronstadt Fortress the destruction of Leningrad, then the main industrial and cultural centre of the Soviet Union, was successfully prevented. The honorary status of \"City of Military Glory\" was conferred on it by the President of the Russian Federation Dmitriy Medvedev on April 27, 2009, citing the \"courage, endurance and mass heroism, exhibited by defenders of the city in the struggle for the freedom and independence of the Motherland\".\\n\\nSection::::Population.\\nWith changing historical trends, the population saw peaks and troughs partly determined by the expansion and then decline of the naval base and dockyard.\\n\\nRecent population data indicate it has stabilised as follows: \\n\\nSection::::Places of interest.\\nThe city of Kronstadt is built on level ground on the island and is thus exposed to flooding, most notably in 1824. The port is ice-bound for 140â160 days in the year, from the beginning of December to April. A very large proportion of the inhabitants are sailors. On the south side of the city there are three harbours: the large western or merchant harbour, the western flank of which is formed by a great pier joining the fortifications which traverse the breadth of the island on one side. The middle harbour was used chiefly for fitting out and repairing vessels. The eastern or military harbour was used for docking vessels of the Russian Navy. The Peter and Catherine Canals connected with the merchant and middle harbours across the city. Between them stood the old \"Italian Palace\" of Prince Menshikov, whose site was later occupied by a school for pilots. In the second half of the 18th century the building of the former Italian palace was used by various military training institutions. In 1771â1798 the Sea Cadet Corps was housed there before being transferred to St Petersburg. From 1798 to 1872 the Navigation School was situated in the former palace.\\nThe Kronstadt tide gauge is situated near the former Italian palace. Sea level observations in Saint Petersburg began already in 1703. On Kotlin Island, the main naval fortress of the Russian Empire began observations in 1707. This monitoring was necessary because the water level of the Finnish Gulf could change considerably in a short time, creating problems for shipping. The annual flood also required close monitoring of the water level. The Kronstadt sea-gauge with the tide gauge pavilion is the zero level of the Baltic system of highs and lows. All depths and altitudes (even the heights of spacecraft) in Russia and some other countries of the former Russian Empire are measured according to the Kronstadt sea-gauge. Yuri Gagarin, the first man in space, said in 1967 that it was \"the Hub of the Universe\".\\n\\nThe modern city\\'s most striking landmark is considered to be the enormous Naval Cathedral, dedicated to St Nicholas and built between 1908 and 1913 in Anchor Square which also contains many military memorials. The Cathedral is regarded as the culmination of Russian Neo-Byzantine architecture.\\nThe Pyotrovsky Gardens is a park that surrounds the monument to Peter the Great who founded the city.\\nThere are a number of historic buildings, such as the \"Dutch Kitchen\" and the former \"Italian Palace\", that recall the city\\'s mercantile and military past. \\nAmong other public buildings are the Naval Hospital, the British Seamen\\'s Hospital (established in 1867), the Civic Hospital, the Admiralty (founded in 1785), the arsenal, dockyards and foundries, the School of Marine Engineering, and the English Church. \\n\\nThe Kronstadt port was considered the most fortified one in the world. It still retains some of its old \"forts\" on small fortified artificial islands. Originally, there were 22 such forts, situated in line with the southern and northern shores of the Gulf of Finland. Some fortifications were located inside the city itself and one was on the western shore of Kronslot Island, on the other side of the main navigational channel.\\n\\nThe construction of the Saint Petersburg Dam led to some of the forts being demolished. The dam, a \"levee-causeway-Seagate combination\" also enabled Kronstadt and some of the forts being reached by land. Among the most important surviving forts are:\\n\\n\\nThere are daily bus and water tours to Kronstadt from Saint Petersburg.\\n\\nSection::::Devotion to St. John of Kronstadt.\\nThe now demolished older St Andrew Cathedral(1817), once a prominent Kronstadt landmark, was destroyed on Communist orders in 1932. St John of Kronstadt, one of the most venerated Russian saints, served there as priest from 1855 to 1908.\\n\\nSection::::Saint Petersburg Dam.\\nThe controversial dam that took 30 years to build (1980â2011) now links Kotlin island to the mainland from north and south, not only acts as part of the flood defences, but lets through shipping and completes the St Petersburg ring-road system, across the island. It is a feat of marine engineering consisting of a combination of levee-causeway and seagate. Its construction on the shoals of the Gulf of Finland involved the removal of some of the historic fortifications.\\n\\nSection::::International relations.\\nSection::::Twin towns and sister cities.\\nKronstadt is twinned with:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kronstadt', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=763125'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'gAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '76349', 'text': 'Shock Corridor\\n\\nShock Corridor is a 1963 American drama film directed and written by Samuel Fuller.

In some localities green bins are also used to contain unsorted municipal waste. The bins are designed and manufactured by Norseman Environmental (an ORBIS brand), a manufacturer of recycling and organic waste containers in North America.\\n\\nThe program's purpose is to reduce the amount of waste shipped to landfills by turning organic waste into compost. The programs collect kitchen and related organic waste (typically including soiled paper products, pet waste, sawdust, and similar items) using a waist-high green curbside container, for which the programs are named. The municipality picks up the waste on a regular basis along with other garbage and recycling collecting, and composts it in an industrial composting facility. While it is true that home composting can also serve this purpose, the green bin programs are viewed as being more convenient and more inclusive of source materials.\\n\\nSection::::Green bins by country.\\nSection::::Canada.\\nThe following municipalities have implemented a Green Bin program:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Compliance.\\nGreen bin programs have thus far been optional for residents excluding those in Hamilton, Ontario. Many residents willingly cooperate with the programs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nIn all programs, some residents perceive an increase in workload related to garbage handling, and object to the program on that basis. In Durham Region, some residents object to a requirement to use biodegradable liner bags, which adds a cost to the home-owner that does not exist in Toronto. The York Region and Toronto Green Bin programs allow residents to use regular plastic grocery sacks as liner bags.\\n\\nThe following mechanisms are typically used to encourage compliance:\\n\\nSection::::United Kingdom.\\nGreen Bin programmes are now common in the UK. Green Bins have been rolled out over the past 10 years to reduce the quantities of biodegradable waste contained in the black bag in response to the Landfill Directive. Another common colour in the UK for garden waste collection is a brown bin. Some councils collect food waste in a separate container for example, for anaerobic digestion or mixed with garden waste in the wheelie bin, where they go to an in vessel composter. In both cases a kitchen caddy, a 7-litre tub is provided by the council, with cornstarch liners and when full are emptied into a small curbside box or into the garden waste bin.

He was a passenger in the car carrying Archduke Franz Ferdinand of Austria and his wife Duchess Sophie of Hohenberg when they were assassinated in Sarajevo on 28 June 1914. In the following World War I, Potiorek commanded the Austro-Hungarian forces in the Serbian Campaign of 1914/15.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn in Bad Bleiberg, Carinthia the son of a mining official, Potiorek attended the Imperial and Royal military institute of technology and the \"Kriegsschule\" academy in Vienna. He joined the Austro-Hungarian general staff in 1879, appointed deputy chief by Emperor Franz Joseph in 1902. However, the emperor ignored his ambitions, when in 1906 he filled the post of Chief-of-Staff with \"Feldmarschall-Leutnant\" Franz Conrad von HÃ¶tzendorf at the behest of heir presumptive and deputy commander-in-chief Archduke Franz Ferdinand. Potiorek became Commanding General at Graz, Styria in the rank of a \"Feldzeugmeister\". Serving as Inspector General in Sarajevo since 1910, he was appointed Bosnian governor (\"Landeschef\") the next year, holding both civil and military offices.\\n\\nIn 1913 Potiorek had invited Archduke Franz Ferdinand and his wife Sophie to watch his troops on maneuvers scheduled for 26 and 27 June 1914. An attack on the life of former governor Marijan VareÅ¡anin in 1910 and several rumours on future assaults (leaked by Serbian Prime Minister Nikola PaÅ¡iÄ) did not keep the archduke from a public appearance in Sarajevo, backed by Potiorek who worried about his own prestige.\\n\\nSection::::Assassination of Archduke Ferdinand.\\nOn 28 June the royal couple arrived from IlidÅ¾a by train and went to Philipovic army camp where Franz Ferdinand performed a brief review of the troops. Potiorek was waiting to take the royal party to the city hall (present-day National and University Library of Bosnia and Herzegovina) for the official reception. Franz Ferdinand, his wife and several officials switched into a six-car motorcade driving down Appel Quay along Miljacka River without further security measures. Potiorek was in the second car, a GrÃ¤f & Stift \"Double Phaeton\" , open six-seater driven by Leopold Lojka, together with the owner Count Harrach and the royal couple. At 10:10, when the vehicles passed the central police station, assassin Nedeljko ÄabrinoviÄ hurled a hand grenade at the archduke\\'s car. Lojka accelerated when he saw the object flying towards the car, the grenade bounced off the coachwork and exploded under the wheel of the next car, wounding the passengers and several spectators.\\n\\nA furious Franz Ferdinand, after attending the official reception at the City Hall, asked about visiting the members of his party that had been wounded by the bomb. A member of the archduke\\'s staff, Andreas von Morsey, according to his own accounts suggested this might be dangerous, but Potiorek replied \"Do you think Sarajevo is full of assassins? I will take responsibility\". Nevertheless, the governor decided that the royal car should travel on an alternative route to the Sarajevo hospital. However, he forgot to tell the driver about this decision. On the way to the hospital, he took a right turn on the Latin Bridge, where one of the conspirators, Gavrilo Princip, was sitting in a corner cafÃ© at the time. The assassin had already abandoned his plans, when he saw the alerted driver began to back up the car right in front of him. He stepped forward, drew his gun, and at a distance of about five feet, fired several times into the car. Franz Ferdinand was hit in the neck and Sophie in the abdomen. Neither Potiorek nor Count Harrach or Lojka were injured. Princip later claimed that the bullet that killed Sophie was meant for the governor.\\n\\nSection::::After Ferdinand\\'s assassination.\\nFollowing the assassination, Potiorek organized and stimulated Anti-Serb riots in Sarajevo. Potiorek reestablished an auxiliary militia Schutzkorps to implement the policy of anti-Serb repression. Schutzkorps, predominantly recruited among Bosniak population, were involved in the persecution of people of Serb ethnicity particularly in Serb populated areas of eastern Bosnia. Around 5,500 citizens of Serb ethnicity in Bosnia and Herzegovina were arrested, between 700 and 2,200 died in prison while 460 were executed. Around 5,200 Serb families were forcibly expelled from Bosnia and Herzegovina.\\n\\nDespite his responsibility, Potiorek remained in office. When the assassination and the succeeding July Crisis led to the outbreak of World War I, he became the commander of all Austro-Hungarian forces on the Balkans. It is speculated that this \"survivor\\'s guilt\" led Potiorek to take charge of the Austro-Hungarian army and lead the first mission to \"punish\" Serbia. He was reportedly very zealous in his actions (multiple times he claimed \"I was spared at Sarajevo so that I may die avenging it!\"), but was apparently an inept commander. The small Royal Serbian Army remained undefeated in all major battles and after the textbook military disasters at the Battle of Cer and the Battle of Kolubara with huge numbers of casualties, he was removed from command on 22 December 1914 and replaced by Archduke Eugen of Austria, a choice that reportedly made him suicidal.\\n\\nSection::::Death and legacy.\\nPotiorek retired to Carinthian Klagenfurt, where he died in 1933.

He campaigned on a platform of campaign finance reform, calling for a $10,000 spending limit and a full disclosure of sources before an election. Markin indicated that his own expenses would be limited to $5,000. He was twenty-seven years old.\\n\\nMarkin's election to the Board of Control gave him an automatic seat on the Metropolitan Toronto council. He emerged as an opponent of downtown Toronto councillor John Sewell, and in 1975 advocated that Metro Council assume direct control of the city's downtown area. He later brought forward a censure motion against Sewell for having said that Metro Parks Commissioner Tommy Thompson deliberately misled council.\\n\\nMarkin called for a reform of North York's election laws in 1975, to permit the senior controller to take over as mayor if the incumbent leaves office in mid-term. He acknowledged to reporters that he held mayoral ambitions himself, but added that he would not seek the position as long as it was held by Mel Lastman, a personal friend.\\n\\nMarkin obtained some national notoriety in late 1976 for speaking out against the federal government's decision to adopt the metric system.\\n\\nMarkin's promising political career came to an unexpected end in late 1976. He attended only one North York council meeting in the second half of the year, and left the city in November to take rabbinical studies in New York. He did not seek re-election in the 1976 campaign.

The lawyer in question had hired Scott as his representative in a disciplinary case six years earlier, and later accused Scott of negligence when the result led to his disbarment. The suit received extensive media coverage before being dismissed by a jury. In 1995, Markin represented a teacher who claimed he was discriminated against by the Toronto Separate (ie. Roman Catholic) School Board, because he himself was not a Catholic. In 2001, he represented Toronto Transit Commission workers who argued that they were exposed to asbestos dust while rebuilding the Sheppard subway station.\\n\\nHe represented Salim Damji in a major fraud case in 2002, and oversaw Damji's plea of guilty to the charges against him.

Markin appealed for a light sentence, arguing that Damji had been put up to the scheme by figures involved in organized crime.\\n\\nSection::::Other.\\nMarkin opened Le Karem kosher wine store in 1986, selling eight types of wine made in accordance with Talmudic principles.

Despite this advantages, it didn't proved very successful, mainly due to low number of manufactured vehicles, as only about 400\\xa0vehicles were manufactured between 1994 and 2002 (taking in consideration all its versions (220, 230, 260) and derivate vehicles â coach, trolleybus, shorter wheelbase version), and probably by concurrence (mainly second hand vehicles but also some new busses) and high price.

Most of the events took place in the Upper South. While the fighting stretched across the entire period, there were times of little or no action, at times spanning several months.\\n\\nThe Cherokee leader Dragging Canoe, whom some historians call \"the Savage Napoleon\", and his warriors and other Cherokee fought alongside and in conjunction with Indians from a number of other tribes, most often Muscogee in the Old Southwest and the Shawnee in the Old Northwest. During the Revolutionary War, they also fought alongside British troops, Loyalist militia, and the King\\'s Carolina Rangers.\\n\\nOpen warfare broke out in the summer of 1776 along the frontier of the Watauga, Holston, Nolichucky, and Doe rivers in East Tennessee, as well as the colonies (later states) of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. It later spread to those along the Cumberland River in Middle Tennessee and in Kentucky.\\n\\nThe wars can be divided into two phases. The first phase one place from 1776 to 1783, in which the Cherokee fought as allies of the Kingdom of Great Britain against the American colonies. The Cherokee War of 1776 encompassed the entirety of the Cherokee nation. At the end of 1776, the only militant Cherokee were those who migrated with Dragging Canoe to the Chickamauga towns and were known as the \"Chickamauga Cherokee\". The second phase lasted from 1783 to 1794, in which the Cherokee served as proxies of the Viceroyalty of New Spain against the recently formed United States of America. Because of their relocation westward to new homes initially known as the \"Five Lower Towns\", they then became known as the Lower Cherokee, a moniker which persisted well into the 19th century. In 1786, the Lower Cherokee became founding members of the Native Americans\\' Western Confederacy, organized by Mohawk leader Joseph Brant, and took an active part in the Northwest Indian War.\\n\\nThe conflict ended in November 1794 with the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. The Northwest Indian War, in which the Cherokee were also involved, ended with the Treaty of Greenville in 1795. \\n\\nSection::::Prelude (1763â75).\\nThe French and Indian War and the related European theater conflict known as the Seven Years\\' War laid many of the foundations for the conflict between the Cherokee and the American settlers on the frontier. These tensions on the frontier broke out into open hostilities with the advent of the American Revolution.\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath of the French and Indian War.\\nThe action of the French and Indian War in North America included the Anglo-Cherokee War, lasting 1758â1761. British forces under general James Grant destroyed a number of major Cherokee towns, which were never reoccupied. Kituwa was abandoned, and its former residents migrated west; they took up residence at \"Mialoquo\", called Great Island Town, on the Little Tennessee River among the Overhill Cherokee.\\n\\nAt the end of this conflict, the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston with the Colony of Virginia (1761) and the Treaty of Charlestown with the Province of South Carolina (1762). Conocotocko (Standing Turkey), the First Beloved Man during the conflict, was replaced by Attakullakulla, who was pro-British.\\n\\nValuing the support of Native Americans, King George III issued the Royal Proclamation of 1763. This prohibited colonial settlement west of the Appalachian Mountains, in an effort to preserve territory for the native tribes. Many colonials resented the interference with their drive to the vast western lands. The proclamation was a major irritant to the colonists, contributing to their support for the American Revolution and ending interference by the Crown.\\n\\nSection::::Treaties and land cessation.\\nTo resolve the problem of settlers living beyond the line established in the previous treaty, John Stuart, as Superintendent for Southern Indian Affairs, negotiated a treaty signed on October 17, 1768, with the Cherokee surrendering their claims to the Colony of Virginia to the land between the Allegheny Mountains and the Ohio River. Essentially, it covered what is now West Virginia and eastern Kentucky, with a bit of the southwest corner of Pennsylvania.\\n\\nAfter Pontiac\\'s War (1763â64), the Iroquois Confederacy ceded to the British government its claims to the hunting grounds between the Ohio and Cumberland rivers, known to them and other Indians as Kain-tuck-ee (Kentucky), in the 1768 Treaty of Fort Stanwix.\\n\\nIn 1769, developers and land speculators planned to start a new colony called Vandalia in the territory ceded by the Cherokee. Plans for that fell through, however, and Virginia annexed it as the District of West Augusta in 1774. On June 1, 1773, the Cherokee and the Muskogee ceded their claims to 2 million acres in the northern sector of the Georgia colony, in return for the cancellation of their debts. Most of the Muscogee refused to recognize the treaty, and the British government rejected it.\\n\\nSection::::Dunmore\\'s War (1774).\\nThe next year, Daniel Boone led a group to establish a temporary settlement inside the hunting grounds of modern day Kansas. In retaliation the Shawnee, Lenape (Delaware), Mingo, and some Cherokee attacked a scouting and forage party, which included Boone\\'s son James. James Boone and Henry Russell (a member of one of the two parties) were captured by the Native Americans and ritually tortured to death. The colonists responded with the beginning of Dunmore\\'s War (1773â1774).\\n\\nThe Cherokee and the Muscogee were active also, mainly confining themselves to small raids on the backcountry settlements of the Carolinas and Georgia. \\n\\nSection::::Early colonial settlements in Upper East Tennessee (1768â1772).\\nThe earliest colonial settlement in the vicinity of what became Upper East Tennessee was Sapling Grove (Bristol). The first of the North-of-Holston settlements, it was founded by Evan Shelby, who \"purchased\" the land in 1768 from John Buchanan. Jacob Brown began another settlement on the Nolichucky River, and John Carter another in what became known as Carter\\'s Valley (between Clinch River and Beech Creek), both in 1771. Following the Battle of Alamance in 1771, James Robertson led a group of some twelve or thirteen Regulator families from North Carolina to the Watauga River.\\n\\nEach of the groups thought they were within the territorial limits of the colony of Virginia. After a survey proved their mistake, Alexander Cameron, Deputy Superintendent for Indian Affairs, ordered them to leave. Attakullakulla, First Beloved Man (Principal Chief) of the Cherokee, interceded on their behalf. The settlers were allowed to remain, provided no additional people joined them.\\n\\nOn May 8, 1772, the settlers on the Watauga and on the Nolichucky signed the Watauga Compact to form the Watauga Association.\\n\\nSection::::Henderson Purchase (1775).\\nOn March 17, 1775, a group of North Carolina speculators led by Richard Henderson negotiated the Treaty of Watauga at Sycamore Shoals with the older Overhill Cherokee leaders; Oconostota and Attakullakulla, the most prominent, ceded the claim of the Cherokee to the Kain-tuck-ee lands. The Transylvania Land Company believed it was gaining ownership of the land, not realizing that other tribes, such as the Lenape, Shawnee, and Chickasaw, also claimed these lands for hunting. Documented Cherokee towns like Sullen Possum in southeast Kentucky and in other areas of Kentucky did exist with links to what is called the Overhill towns and other Cherokee towns.\\n\\nDragging Canoe, headman of Great Island Town and son of Attakullakulla, refused to go along with the deal. He told the North Carolina men, \"You have bought a fair land, but there is a cloud hanging over it; you will find its settlement dark and bloody\". The governors of Virginia and North Carolina repudiated the Watauga treaty, and Henderson fled to avoid arrest. George Washington also spoke out against it. The Cherokee appealed to John Stuart, the Indian Affairs Superintendent, for help, which he had provided on previous such occasions, but the outbreak of the American Revolution intervened.\\n\\nHenderson and frontiersmen thought the outbreak of the Revolution superseded the judgments of the royal governors. The Transylvania Company began recruiting settlers for the region they had \"purchased\".\\n\\nSection::::Revolutionary War phase: Cherokee War of 1776.\\nDuring the Revolutionary War, the Cherokee not only fought against the settlements in the Overmountain region, and later in the Cumberland Basin, defending against territorial encroachment, they also fought as allies of Great Britain against its rebellious subjects. British strategy was focused on the North, and not so much on the backwoods settlements, especially those in the west. The Cherokee, therefore, were on their own, except for supplies from British ports on the coast and some joint operations in South Carolina.\\n\\nSection::::Flight of the Loyalists.\\nAs tensions rose, Loyalist John Stuart, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs, was besieged by a mob at his house in Charleston and had to flee for his life. His first stop was St. Augustine in East Florida.\\n\\nAnother noted Loyalist later associated with the Cherokee, Thomas Brown, was not nearly so fortunate. In his home of Brownsborough, Georgia, near Augusta, he was assaulted by a crowd of the Sons of Liberty, tied to a tree, roasted with fire, scalped, tarred, and feathered. After his escape, he took up residence among the Seminole commanding his East Florida Rangers, who fought with them and some of the Lower Muskogee.\\n\\nFrom St. Augustine, Stuart sent his deputy, Alexander Cameron, and his brother Henry to Mobile to obtain short-term supplies and arms for the Cherokee. Dragging Canoe took a party of 80 warriors to provide security for the pack train. He met Henry Stuart and Cameron (whom he had adopted as a brother) at Mobile on March 1, 1776. He asked how he could help the British against their rebel subjects, and for help with the illegal settlers. The two men told him to wait for regular troops to arrive before taking any action.\\n\\nWhen the two arrived at Chota, Henry Stuart sent out letters to the frontier settlers. He informed them that they were illegally on Cherokee land and gave them 40 days to leave. In an exercise of propaganda, people sympathetic to the Revolution forged a letter to indicate a large force of regular troops, plus Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Muscgoee, was on the march from Pensacola and planning to pick up reinforcements from the Cherokee. The forged letters alarmed the settlers, who began gathering together in closer, fortified groups, building stations (small forts), and otherwise preparing for an attack.\\n\\nSection::::Visit from the northern tribes.\\nIn May 1776, partly at the behest of Henry Hamilton, the British governor in Detroit, the Shawnee chief Cornstalk led a delegation from the northern tribes (Shawnee, Lenape, Iroquois, Ottawa, others) to the southern tribes. He traveled to Chota to meet with the southern tribes (Cherokee, Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw) about fighting with the British against their common enemy. Cornstalk called for united action against those they called the \"Long Knives\", the squatters who settled and remained in Kain-tuck-ee, or, as the settlers called it, Transylvania. At the close of his speech, Cornstalk offered his war belt, and Dragging Canoe accepted it. Dragging Canoe also accepted belts from the Ottawa and the Iroquois.\\n\\nTo prepare themselves for the coming campaign, the Overhill Cherokee began raiding into Kentucky, often with the Shawnee. Before the northern delegation had left, Dragging Canoe led a small war party into Kentucky and returned with four scalps to present to Cornstalk before they departed. In another raid, a war party led by Hanging Maw, captured three teenage settler girls, Jemima Boone and Elizabeth and Frances Callaway, on July 14 but lost them three days later to a rescue party led by Daniel Boone, father of Jemima, and Richard Callaway, father of Elizabeth and Frances.\\n\\nSection::::First Cherokee campaigns.\\nIn late June, war parties from the Lower Towns began attacking the frontier of South Carolina. On July 1, the Out, Middle, and Valley Towns sent out war parties raiding the frontiers settlements of North Carolina east of the Blue Ridge coming down the Catawba River. Meanwhile, traders warned the Overmountain settlers of the impending attacks from the Overhill Towns. They had come from Chota bearing word from Nancy Ward, the Beloved Woman (leader or Elder). The Cherokee offensive proved to be disastrous for the attackers.\\n\\nOn July 3, a small war party of Cherokee besieged a small fort on the North Carolina frontier. The garrison managed to keep from being overrun until a large body of militia arrived in the rear of besiegers, who then retreated.\\n\\nA 190-strong war party of Cherokee and Loyalist partisans dressed as Cherokee attacked the large fort on the South Carolina frontier known as Lindley\\'s Station. Its 150-man Patriot garrison had just finished building it the day before. After repulsing the attack, the Patriots gave chase, killing two Loyalists and capturing ten, but inflicting no casualties on the Cherokee.\\n\\nDragging Canoe\\'s forces advanced up the Great Indian Warpath and had a small skirmish with a body of militia numbering twenty who quickly withdrew. Pursuing them and intending to take Fort Lee at Long-Island-on-the-Holston, his force advanced toward the island. However, on July 20, it encountered a larger force of militia six miles from their target, about half the size of his own but desperate, in a stronger position than the small group before. During the \"Battle of Island Flats\" which followed, Dragging Canoe was wounded in his hip by a musket ball, and his brother Little Owl incredibly survived after being hit eleven times. His force then withdrew, raiding isolated cabins on the way and returned to the Overhill area with plunder and scalps, after raiding further north into southwestern Virginia.\\n\\non July 21, Abraham of Chilhowee led his party in attempting to capture Fort Caswell on the Watauga, but his attack was driven off with heavy casualties. Instead of withdrawing, however, he put the garrison under siege, a tactic which had worked well the previous decade with Fort Loudon. After two weeks, though, he and his warriors gave that up. Savanukah\\'s party raided from the outskirts of Carter\\'s Valley far into the Clinch River Valley in Virginia, but those targets contained only small settlements and isolated farmsteads, so he did no real military damage.\\n\\nSection::::Colonial response.\\nThe affected colonies of Virginia, North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia conferred and decided that swift and massive retaliation was the only way to preserve peace on the frontier. The colonials gathered militia who retaliated against the Cherokee. North Carolina sent Griffith Rutherford with 2,400 militia to scour the Oconaluftee and Tuckasegee river valleys, and the headwaters of the Little Tennessee and Hiwassee. South Carolina sent 1,800 men to the Savannah, and Georgia sent 200 to attack Cherokee settlements along the Chattahoochee and Tugaloo rivers.\\n\\nNot long after leaving Fort McGahey on July 23, Rutherford\\'s militia, accompanied by a large contingent of Catawba warriors, encountered an ambush by the Cherokee at the Battle of Cowee Gap in what is now western North Carolina. After defeating the attackers, he proceeded to a designated rendezvous with the South Carolina militia.\\n\\nOn August 1, Cameron and the Cherokee ambushed Andrew Williamson and his South Carolina militia force near the Lower Cherokee town of Isunigu known to whites as Seneca, in the Battle of Twelve Mile Creek. The South Carolina Militia retreated and later joined up with the militia force of Andrew Pickens. The next day, August 2, the joint militia force bivouacked, and Pickens led a party of 25 to forage for food and firewood. In what is known as the Ring Fight, 200 Cherokee surrounded and attacked the party, which withdrew into a ring and were able to hold their attackers at bay until reinforcements arrived. Pickens and his militia defeated the Cherokee on the Tugaloo River in the Battle of Tugaloo, which they then burned on August 10. On August 12, Williamson and Pickens defeated the Cherokee at the Battle of Tamassee. With this, they had completed their destruction of the Lower Towns, Keowee, Estatoe, Seneca, and the rest. Afterwards, they proceeded north to meet up with the North Carolina militia of Griffith Rutherford.\\n\\nRutherford\\'s militia traversed Swannanoa Gap in the Blue Ridge on September 1, and reached the outskirts of the Out, Valley, and Middle Towns on September 14, at which they started burning towns and crops. Williamson\\'s militia were attacked at the Battle of Black Hole near Franklin, North Carolina on September 19 but were able to fend off the Cherokee and meet up with Rutherford. In all, Williamson, Pickens, and Rutherford destroyed more than 50 towns, burned the houses and food stores, destroyed the orchards, slaughtered livestock, and killed hundreds of Cherokee. They sold captives into slavery, and these were often transported to the Caribbean.\\n\\nIn the meantime, the Continental Army sent Col. William Christian to the lower Little Tennessee Valley with a battalion of Continentals, 500 Virginia militia, 300 North Carolina militia, and 300 rangers. Upon reaching the Little Tennessee in late October, Christian\\'s Virginia force found those towns from whence the militant attackers had sprungâGreat Island, Citico (\"Sitiku\"), Toqua (\"Dakwayi\"), Tuskegee (\"Taskigi\"), Chilhowee, and Great Tellicoânot only deserted but burned to the ground by their own former inhabitants, along with all the food and stores that could not be carried away.\\n\\nSection::::Migration to Chickamauga.\\nOconostota supported making peace with the colonists. Dragging Canoe called for the women, children, and old to be sent below the Hiwassee and for the warriors to burn the towns, then ambush the Virginians at the French Broad River. Oconostota, Attakullakulla, and the older chiefs decided against that plan. Oconostota sent word to the approaching colonial army, offering to exchange Dragging Canoe and Cameron if the Overhill Towns were spared.\\n\\nDragging Canoe spoke to the council of the Overhill Towns, denouncing the older leaders as rogues and \"Virginians\" for their willingness to cede land for an ephemeral safety. He concluded, \"As for me, I have my young warriors about me. We will have our lands.\" Afterward, he and other militant leaders, including Ostenaco, gathered like-minded Cherokee from the Overhill, Valley, and Hill towns, and migrated to what is now the Chattanooga, Tennessee area,\\nwhere the Great Indian Warpath crossed the Chickamauga River (South Chickamauga Creek). Since Dragging Canoe made that town his seat of operations, frontier Americans called his faction the \"Chickamaugas\". Other Cherokee refugees turned up in Pensacola and wintered there.\\n\\nJohn McDonald already had a trading post across the Chickamauga River. This provided a link to Henry Stuart, brother of John, in the West Florida capital of Pensacola. Cameron, the British deputy Indian superintendent, accompanied Dragging Canoe to Chickamauga. Nearly all the whites legally resident among the Cherokee were part of the related exodus.\\nIn March 1777, Cameron sent the refugees to Chickamauga along with a sizable amount of goods. The colonials learned of the materiel and planned to intercept it. When Cameron informed him of the danger, Emistisigua, Paramount Chief of the Upper Muscogee, sent a force of 350 warriors to guard them as well as to assist in rebuilding and waging war.\\n\\nSection::::Treaties of 1777.\\nPreliminary negotiations between the Overhill Towns and Virginia were held at Fort Patrick Henry in April 1777. Nathaniel Gist, later father of Sequoyah, led the talks for Virginia, while Attakullakulla, Oconostota, and Savanukah headed the delegation of Cherokee.\\n\\nThe Cherokee signed the \"Treaty of Dewitt\\'s Corner\" with Georgia and South Carolina on May 20 and the \"Treaty of Fort Henry\" with Virginia and North Carolina on July 20. They promised to stop warring, with those colonies promising in return to protect them from attack. In the Treaty of Dewitt\\'s Corner, the Lower Towns ceded all their land in modern South Carolina except for a small strip in what is now Oconee County. One provision of the Treaty of Fort Henry required that James Robertson and a small garrison be quartered at Chota on the Little Tennessee. He had been appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for North Carolina, while Joseph Martin had been appointed Superintendent of Indian Affairs for Virginia.\\n\\nSection::::Targets of the Cherokee.\\nFrom their new bases, the Cherokee conducted raids against settlers on the Holston, Doe, Watauga, and Nolichucky rivers, on the Cumberland and Red rivers, and those in the isolated frontier stations in between. The Cherokee ambushed parties traveling on the Tennessee River, and on local sections of the many ancient trails that served as \"highways\", such as the Great Indian Warpath (Mobile to northeast Canada), the Cisca and St. Augustine Trail (St. Augustine to the French Salt Lick at Nashville), the Cumberland Trail (from the Upper Creek Path to the Great Lakes), and the Nickajack Trail (Nickajack to Augusta). Later, the Cherokee stalked the Natchez Trace and roads improved by the uninvited settlers, such as the Kentucky, Cumberland, and Walton roads. Occasionally, the Cherokee attacked targets in Virginia, the Carolinas, Georgia, Kentucky, and the Ohio country.\\n\\nIn contempt of the peace proceedings at Fort Henry in April 1777, Dragging Canoe led a war party that killed a settler named Frederick Calvitt and stole 15 horses from James Robertson, then moved to Carter\\'s Valley, killing the grandparents of David Crockett along with several children near the modern Rogersville, and marauding across the valley. In all the raiders took twelve scalps.\\n\\nIn summer 1777, Deputy Superintendents Cameron and Taitt led a large contingent of Cherokee and Muscogee warriors against the back country settlements of the Carolinas and Georgia. The Cherokee established a camp at the confluence of the Tennessee and Ohio Rivers (near present-day Paducah, Kentucky) to prevent infiltration into the Mississippi in the spring of 1778.\\n\\nSection::::Revolutionary War phase: Southern strategy (1778â1783).\\nIn late 1778, British strategy shifted south. As their attention went, so too did their efforts, their armies, and their supplies, including those slated for the Southern Indians. The Southern theater had the added advantage of being home to more Loyalists than the North. With all these new advantages, the Cherokee were able to greatly renew their territorial defense. Both the Cherokee and the Upper Creek signed on for active participation.\\n\\nSection::::British victory in the North.\\nOn December 17, 1778, Henry Hamilton captured Fort Vincennes and used it as a base to plan a spring offensive against George Rogers Clark, whose forces had recently seized control of much of the Illinois Country. His plans were to assemble 500 warriors from various Indian nations, including the Cherokee, the Chickasaw, the Shawnee, and others, for a campaign to expel Clark\\'s forces back east, then drive through Kentucky clearing American settlements. McDonald\\'s headquarters at Chickamauga was to be the staging ground and commissary for the Cherokee and the Muscogee. Clark recaptured Fort Vincennes, and Hamilton along with it, on February 25, 1779, after the Siege of Fort Vincennes. The Chickamauga Cherokee turned their sights to the northeast.\\n\\nSection::::Battles in the Deep South.\\nThe British captured Savannah on December 29, 1778, with help from Dragging Canoe, John McDonald, and the Cherokee, along with McGillivray\\'s Upper Muscogee force and McIntosh\\'s band of Hitichiti warriors. Just over a month later, January 31, 1779, they captured Augusta, Georgia, as well, though they quickly had to retreat. With these victories, the remaining neutral towns of the Lower Muscogee Threw in their lot with the British side. Thomas Brown of the King\\'s Carolina Rangers was assigned to the Atlantic District to work with the Cherokee, Muscogee, and Seminole.\\n\\nCharlestown was captured on May 12, 1780, after a siege that began March 29. Along with it, the British took prisoner some 3,000 Patriots, including South Carolina militia leader Andrew Williamson. Upon giving his parole that he would not again take up arms, Williamson became a double agent for the Patriots, according to testimony after the war by Patriot General Nathanael Greene.\\n\\nSection::::Fort Nashborough.\\nIn early 1779, Robertson and John Donelson traveled overland along the Kentucky Road and founded Fort Nashborough on the Cumberland River. It was the first of many such settlements in the Cumberland area, which subsequently became the focus of attacks by all the tribes in the surrounding region. Leaving a small group there, both returned east. In autumn 1779, Robertson and a group of fellow Wataugans left the east down the Kentucky Road headed for Fort Nashborough. They arrived on Christmas Day 1779 without incident.\\n\\nDonelson journeyed down the Tennessee River with a party that included his family, intending to go across to the mouth of the Cumberland, then upriver to Fort Nashborough. They departed the East Tennessee settlements on February 27, 1780. Eventually, the group did reach its destination, but only after being ambushed several times. In the first encounter near Tuskegee Island on March 7, the Cherokee warriors under Bloody Fellow attacked the boat in the rear. Its passengers had come down with smallpox. They took as captive the one survivor, who was later ransomed by American colonists. The victory proved to be a pyrrhic one for the Cherokee, a smallpox epidemic spread among its people, killing several hundred in the vicinity. Several miles downriver, beginning with the obstruction known as the Suck or the Kettle, the party was fired upon throughout their passage through the Tennessee River Gorge (Cash Canyon); one person died and several were wounded. At Muscle Shoals, the Donelson party was attacked by Muscogee and Chickasaw, up into Hardin County, Tennessee. The Donelson party reached its destination on April 24, 1780. The group included John\\'s daughter Rachel, the future wife of future U.S. Representative, Senator, and President Andrew Jackson, who fought a duel in her honor in 1806. Shortly after his party\\'s arrival at Fort Nashborough, Donelson along with Robertson and others formed the Cumberland Compact.\\n\\nSection::::Overmountain theatre.\\nRobertson heard warning from Chota that Dragging Canoe\\'s warriors were going to attack the Holston area. In addition, he had received intelligence that McDonald\\'s place was the staging area for the northern campaign that Hamilton had been planning to conduct, and that a stockpile of supplies equivalent to that of 100 packhorses was stored there. Small parties of Cherokee began repeated small raids on the Holston frontier shortly thereafter.\\n\\nIn the summer of 1780, Thomas Brown planned to have a joint conference between the Cherokee and Muscogee to plan ways to coordinate their attacks, but those plans were forestalled when Georgians under Elijah Clarke made a concerted effort to retake Augusta in September, where he had his headquarters. His King\\'s Carolina Rangers and 50 Muscogee warriors formed the entire garrison against Clarke\\'s 700 fighters.\\n\\nThe arrival of a sizable war party from the Chickamauga and Overhill Towns and a force from Fort Ninety-Six in South Carolina prevented the capture of both, and the Cherokee and Brown\\'s rangers chased Elijah Clarke\\'s army into the arms of John Sevier, wreaking havoc on rebellious settlements along the way. This set the stage for the Battle of Kings Mountain October 7, 1780, in which Loyalist militia American Volunteers under Patrick Ferguson moved south trying to encircle Clarke; they were defeated by a force of 900 frontiersmen under Sevier and William Campbell, who were referred to as the Overmountain Men.\\n\\nBrown, aware that nearly 1,000 men were away from the American settlements with the militias, urged Dragging Canoe and other Cherokee leaders to strike while they had the opportunity. Under the influence of Savanukah, the Overhill Towns gave their full support to the new offensive. Both Brown and the Cherokee had been expecting a quick victory by Patrick Ferguson and were stunned that he suffered such a resounding defeat so soon. But their planned assault on the settlements was in motion.\\nLearning of the new invasion from Nancy Ward (her second documented betrayal of Dragging Canoe), Virginia Governor Thomas Jefferson sent an expedition of 700 Virginians and North Carolinians against the Cherokee in December 1780, under the command of Sevier. The expedition routed a Cherokee war party at the Battle of Boyd\\'s Creek on December 16.\\n\\nAfter that battle, Sevier\\'s army was joined by forces under Arthur Campbell and Joseph Martin. The combined force marched against the Overhill towns on the Little Tennessee and the Hiwassee, burning seventeen of them, including Chota, Chilhowee, the original Citico, Tellico, Great Hiwassee, and Chestowee, finishing up on January 1, 1781. Afterwards, the Overhill leaders withdrew from further active conflict for a time, though warriors from the Middle and Valley Towns continued to harass colonists on the frontier. \\n\\nNot long after returning home from his destruction of the Overhill towns, Sevier had received word that the warriors from the Middle Towns were bent on revenge. At the beginning of March, Sevier raised a force for a campaign against the Middle and Out Towns east of the mountains. Beginning at Tuckasegee and ending at Cowee, they burned 15 towns, killed 29 Cherokee, and took 9 prisoners.\\n\\nWhile Dragging Canoe and his warriors turned their attentions to the Cumberland, the Shawnee began raiding settlements in Upper East Tennessee and Southwest Virginia, the latter by now having become Washington County. In particular they targeted those along the Clinch and Holston Rivers and in Powell\\'s Valley. These Shawnee came down from their homes on the Ohio River by way of the Warriors\\' Path through the Cumberland Gap. Their attacks continued, along with occasional forays by McGillivray\\'s Upper Muscogee, even after sporadic raids by the Cherokee renewed, until they began to focus all their attention on the Northwest Indian War.\\n\\nIn midsummer 1781, a party of Cherokee came west over the mountains and began raiding the new settlements on the French Broad River. Sevier raised a force of 150 and attacked their camp on Indian Creek.\\n\\nOn July 26, 1781, the Overhill Towns signed the second Treaty of Long-Island-on-the-Holston, this time directly with the Overmountain settlements. In response to incursions by new settlers beyond the limits of the treaties, warriors from the Chickamauga Towns began harassing the Holston frontier in the spring and summer of 1782. In September, an expedition under Sevier once again destroyed many of the towns in the Chickamauga vicinity, and those Cherokee of the former Lower Towns now in North Georgia, from Buffalo Town at the modern Ringgold, Georgia south to Ustanali (\"Ustanalahi\") near modern Calhoun, Georgia, including what he called Vann\\'s Town, as well as Ellijay and Coosawattee. Most of the towns were deserted because having advance warning of the impending attack, Dragging Canoe and his fellow leaders chose relocation westward. Meanwhile, Sevier\\'s army, guided by John Watts, somehow never managed to cross paths with any parties of Cherokee.\\n\\nSection::::Attacks at Chickamauga.\\nAt the beginning of April 1779, a group of 300 Cherokee and 50 Loyalist Rangers under Walter Scott, left the Chickamauga Towns headed for a marauding campaign against the frontier settlements in Georgia and South Carolina. Hearing of their departure, Joseph Martin, Indian agent for the Americans at Chota, sent word to Governor Patrick Henry of their absence.\\n\\nThe state governments of Virginia and North Carolina made a joint decision to send an expedition against the Chickamauga Towns, who were thought to be responsible for the raids. Most of those warriors, however, were in South Carolina with Cameron and Dragging Canoe. A thousand Overmountain men under Evan Shelby (father of Isaac Shelby, first governor of the State of Kentucky) and a regiment of Continentals under John Montgomery disembarked on April 10, boating down the Tennessee in a fleet of dugout canoes. They arrived in the Chickamauga towns ten days later. For the next two weeks, they destroyed the eleven towns in the immediate area, and most of the food supply, along with McDonald\\'s home, store, and commissary. Because the warriors were on a campaign in Georgia and South Carolina, there was no resistance and only four deaths among the inhabitants. Whatever was not destroyed was confiscated and sold at what became known as Sale Creek.\\nUpon hearing of the devastation of the towns and loss of all their stores, Dragging Canoe, McDonald, and their men, including the Rangers, returned to Chickamauga and its vicinity. The Shawnee sent envoys to Chickamauga to find out if the destruction had caused Dragging Canoe\\'s people to lose the will to fight, along with a sizable detachment of warriors to assist them. In response to their inquiries, Dragging Canoe held up the war belts he had accepted when the delegation visited Chota in 1776, and said, \"We are not yet conquered\". To cement the alliance, the Cherokee responded to the Shawnee gesture by sending nearly 100 warriors north. The towns in the Chickamauga area were rebuilt. Dragging Canoe responded to the Shelby expedition with punitive raids on the frontiers of both North Carolina and Virginia.\\n\\nIn midsummer 1779, Cameron arrived at Chickamauga with a company of Loyalist Refugees and convinced the Cherokee to join them on their march to South Carolina. Three hundred took up arms and headed out to maraud the backcountry of Georgia and South Carolina. Later in October, Andrew Williamson\\'s South Carolina militia responded by attacking several towns on the eastern frontier of Cherokee territory and burning their foodstores.\\n\\nSection::::Chickasaw-American war.\\nThe Chickasaw transformed from river sentries into attacking warriors in June 1780 when George Rogers Clark and a party of over 500, including some Kaskaskia of the Illinois Confederation, built Fort Jefferson and the surrounding settlement of Clarksville near the mouth of the Ohio, inside their hunting grounds. The building had begun in April and finished before the first attack on June 7.\\n\\nAfter learning of the trespass, the Chickasaw destroyed the settlement, laid siege to the fort, and began attacking settlers on the Kentucky frontier. They continued attacking the Cumberland and into Kentucky through early the following year. Their last raid was in conjunction with Dragging Canoe\\'s Cherokee, upon Freeland\\'s Station on the Cumberland on January 11, 1781.\\n\\nThree months after the first Chickasaw attack on the Cumberland, on April 2, 1781, the Cherokee launched their largest campaign of the wars against those settlements. This culminated in what became known as the Battle of the Bluff, led by Dragging Canoe. It lasted through to the next day and was the last attack of this war. Afterward, settlers began to abandon these frontier settlements until only three stations were left, a condition which lasted until 1785.\\n\\nSection::::Lenape refugees.\\nWhile the Middle Towns warriors kept the Overmountain Men busy, the Chickamauga Towns welcome a sizable party of Lenape warriors seeking refuge from the fighting in the Illinois and Ohio Countries. These were not just warriors down south temporarily but permanent settlers who brought their families.\\n\\nSection::::Politics in the Overhill Towns.\\nIn the fall of 1781, the British engineered a coup d\\'Ã©tat of sorts that put Savanukah as First Beloved Man in place of the more pacifist Oconostota, who succeeded Attakullakulla. For the next two years, the Overhill Cherokee openly, as they had been doing covertly, supported the efforts of Dragging Canoe and his militant Cherokee.\\n\\nSection::::Death of Alexander Cameron.\\nOn December 27, 1781, Alexander Cameron, British Superintendent of Indian Affairs for the Mississippi District, blood brother to Dragging Canoe, and friend to all Cherokee, died in Savannah. He was replaced by John Graham.\\n\\nSection::::Diplomatic mission to Fort St. Louis.\\nA party of Cherokee joined the Lenape, Shawnee, and Chickasaw in a diplomatic visit to the Spanish at Fort St. Louis in the Missouri country in March 1782 seeking a new avenue of obtaining arms and other assistance in the prosecution of their ongoing conflict with the Americans in the Ohio Valley. One group of Cherokee at this meeting led by Standing Turkey (Conocotocko) sought and received permission to settle in Spanish Louisiana, in the region of the White River.\\n\\nSection::::Migration to the Lower Towns.\\nUpon finishing their move, Dragging Canoe and his people established what whites called the Five Lower Towns downriver from the various natural obstructions in the 26-mile Tennessee River Gorge, known locally as Cash Canyon. Starting with Tuskegee (aka Brown\\'s or Williams\\') Island and the sandbars on either side of it, these obstructions included the Tumbling Shoals, the Holston Rock, the Kettle (or Suck), the Suck Shoals, the Deadman\\'s Eddy, the Pot, the Skillet, the Pan, and, finally, the Narrows, ending with Hale\\'s Bar. The whole 26 miles was sometimes called The Suck, and the stretch of river was notorious enough to merit mention even by Thomas Jefferson. These navigational hazards were so formidable, in fact, that the French agents attempting to travel upriver to reach Cherokee country during the French and Indian War, intending to establish an outpost at the spot later occupied by British agent McDonald, gave up after several attempts.\\n\\nThe Five Lower Towns included Running Water (\"Amogayunyi\"), at the current Whiteside in Marion County, Tennessee, where Dragging Canoe made his headquarters; Nickajack (\"Ani-Kusati-yi\", or Koasati place), eight kilometers down the Tennessee River; Long Island (\"Amoyeligunahita\"), on the Tennessee just above the Great Creek Crossing; Crow Town (\"Kagunyi\") on the Tennessee, at the mouth of Crow Creek; and Stecoyee (\"Utsutigwayi\", Lookout Mountain Town), at the current site of Trenton, Georgia. Tuskegee Island Town was reoccupied as a lookout post by a small band of warriors to provide advance warning of invasions, and eventually many other settlements in the area were resettled as well.\\n\\nBecause this was a move into the outskirts of Muscogee territory, Dragging Canoe, knowing such a move might be necessary, had previously sent a delegation under Little Owl to meet with Alex McGillivray, the major Muscogee leader in the area, to gain their permission. When the Cherokee moved their base, so too did John McDonald, now deputy to Thomas Brown, along with his own assistant Daniel Ross, making Running Water the base of operations. Graham\\'s deputy, Alexander Campbell, set up his own base at what became Turkeytown.\\n\\nCherokee continued to migrate westward to join Dragging Canoe\\'s militant band. Many in this influx were Cherokee from North Georgia, who fled the depredations of expeditions such as those of Sevier; a large majority of these were former inhabitants of the original Lower Towns. Cherokee from the Middle, or Hill, Towns also came, a group of whom established a town named Sawtee (\"Itsati\") at the mouth of South Sauta Creek on the Tennessee.\\n\\nLater major settlements included Willstown (\"Titsohiliyi\") near the later Fort Payne; Turkeytown (\"Gundigaduhunyi\"), at the head of the Cumberland Trail where the Upper Creek Path crossed the Coosa River near Centre, Alabama; Creek Path (\"Kusanunnahiyi\"), near at the intersection of the Great Indian Warpath with the Upper Creek Path at the modern Guntersville, Alabama; Turnip Town (\"Ulunyi\"), 7 miles from the present-day Rome, Georgia; and Chatuga (\"Tsatugi\"), nearer the site of Rome.\\n\\nPartly because of the large influx from North Georgia added to the fact that they were no longer occupying the Chickamauga area as their main center, Dragging Canoe\\'s followers and others in the area began to be referred to as the Lower Cherokee. The ranks of these new Lower Cherokee were further swelled by runaway slaves, white Tories, Muscogee, Yuchi, Natchez, and Shawnee, plus a few Spanish, French, Irish, and Germans. The town Coosada came into the coalition when its Koasati and Kaskinampo inhabitants joined Dragging Canoe\\'s coalition. The band of Chickasaw living at Ditto\\'s Landing south of Huntsville, Alabama, also joined the coalition. The rest of the Chickasaw, however, were trying to play the Americans and the Spanish against each other with no interest in the British.\\n\\nSection::::Cherokees to the North.\\nIn November 1782, twenty representatives from four northern tribesâWyandot, Ojibwa, Ottawa, and Potowatamiâtraveled south to consult with Dragging Canoe and his lieutenants at his new headquarters in Running Water Town, which was nestled far back up the hollow from the Tennessee River onto which it opened. Their mission was to gain the help of Dragging Canoe\\'s Cherokee in attacking Pittsburgh and the American settlements in Kentucky and the Illinois country. When the party returned north, Turtle-at-Home, brother of Dragging Canoe, took 70 warriors north to fight alongside the Shawnee. \\n\\nAt the beginning of 1783, there were at least three major communities of Cherokee in the region. One lived among the Chalahgawtha (Chillicothe) Shawnee. The second Cherokee community lived among the mixed Wyandot-Mingo towns on the upper Mad River near the later Zanesfield, Ohio. A third group of Cherokee is known to have lived among and fought with the Munsee-Lenape, the only portion of the Lenape nation at war with the Americans. Though filled by different warriors shifted back and forth, these three bands remained in the northwest until after the Treaty of Greenville in 1795.\\n\\nSection::::Georgia Indian war of 1782.\\nAt the end of 1781, the Cherokee invaded Georgia once again with a group of Muscogee, this time being met by South Carolina and Georgia troops under Andrew Pickens and Elijah Clarke at the Oconee River after much back country raiding. Evading the American force, the Cherokee withdrew, adopting a scorched earth strategy to deny their foes supplies. The force eventually retreated, opening the back country to further raids.\\n\\nBy the fall of 1782, Lt. Col. Thomas Waters of the Loyalist Rangers, formerly stationed at Fort Ninety-Six in South Carolina, had retreated to the frontier of Cherokee-Muscogee territory just outside Georgia. From his base at the mouth of Long Swamp Creek on Etowah River, he and his remaining rangers, in conjunction with Cherokee and Muscogee warriors, ravaged backwoods homesteads and settlements.\\n\\nThe states of South Carolina and Georgia sent out a joint expedition led by Andrew Pickens and Elijah Clarke to put an end to his insurgency. Leaving September 16, they invaded that section of the country, ranging at least as far as Ustanali, where they took prisoners. In all they destroyed thirteen towns and villages. By October 22, Waters and his men had escaped and the Cherokee sued for peace.\\n\\nSection::::St. Augustine conference.\\nIn January 1783, Dragging Canoe and 1,200 Cherokee traveled to St. Augustine, the capital of East Florida, for a summit meeting with a delegation of western tribes (Shawnee, Muscogee, Mohawk, Seneca, Lenape, Mingo, Tuscarora, and Choctaw) called for a federation of Indians to oppose the Americans and their frontier colonists. Brown, the British Indian Superintendent, approved the concept.\\n\\nAt Tuckabatchee a few months later, a general council of the major southern tribes (Cherokee, Muscogee, Chickasaw, Choctaw, and Seminole) plus representatives of smaller groups (Mobile, Catawba, Biloxi, Huoma, etc.) took place to follow up, but plans for the federation were cut short by the signing of the Treaty of Paris. Signed May 30, 1783, the treaty confirmed the northern boundary between the State of Georgia and the Cherokee, with the Cherokee ceding large amounts of land between the Savannah and Chattachoochee Rivers.\\n\\nSection::::Overhill politics.\\nIn the fall of 1783, the older pacifist leaders replaced Savanukah with another of their number, Corntassel (\"Kaiyatsatahi\", known to history as \"Old Tassel\"), and sent messages of peace along with complaints of settler encroachment to Virginia and North Carolina. Opposition from pacifist leaders, however, never stopped war parties from traversing the territories of any of the town groups, largely because the average Cherokee supported their cause, nor did it stop small war parties of the Overhill Towns from raiding settlements in East Tennessee, mostly those on the Holston.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty of Paris (1783).\\nSigned between Great Britain and the United States on September 3, 1783, the Treaty of Paris treaty formally ended the American Revolution. The U.S. had already unilaterally declared hostilities over the previous April. Brown had already received orders from London in June to cease and desist.\\n\\nFollowing that treaty, Dragging Canoe turned to the Spanish (who still claimed all the territory south of the Cumberland and were now working \"against\" the Americans) for support, trading primarily through Pensacola and Mobile. Dragging Canoe also maintained relations with the British governor at Detroit, Alexander McKee, through regular diplomatic missions there under his brothers Little Owl and The Badger (\"Ukuna\").\\n\\nWith the end of the Revolutionary War, new settlers began flooding into the Overmountain settlements. The reaction from the Cherokee was predictable, only it did not come from the towns on the lower Little Tennessee. Instead, warriors from the Middle Towns east of the mountains on the upper Little Tennessee began retaliation against the settlements on the west side, targeting the newer ones on the Pigeon and French Broad rivers. In late 1783, Major Peter Fine raised a small militia and crossed the mountains to the east side and burned down the town of Cowee.\\n\\nSection::::Treaties with the Chickasaw and Muscogee.\\nThe Chickasaw signed the Treaty of French Lick with the new United States of America on November 6, 1783, and never again took up arms against it. The Lower Cherokee were also present at the conference and apparently made some sort of agreement to cease their attacks on the Cumberland, for after this Americans settlements in the area began to grow again.\\n\\nAlso in November 1783, the pro-American camp of the Lower Muscogee nation signed the Treaty of Augusta with Georgia, ceding their claims to territory in northern Georgia known as the Oconee Country, after the tribe who lived there. This enraged McGillivray, who wanted to keep fighting; he burned the houses of the leaders responsible and sent warriors to raid Georgia settlements.\\n\\nSection::::Post-Revolution: New directions (1783â1788).\\nSection::::Spanish alliance.\\nThe Spanish now held East Florida and West Florida in addition to Louisiana, Tejas, Nuevo Mexico, and Nueva California. Partly to hold the Americans at bay and partly to regain lost parts of La Florida, they armed and supplied the Southern Indians both to curry favor and to encourage them to turn their weapons on the frontier settlements. Largely through the efforts of Alex McGillivray, the Spanish signed the Treaty of Pensacola for alliance and commerce with the Upper Muscogee and the Lower Cherokee on May 30, 1784. On June 22, 1784, the Treaty of Mobile was signed with the Choctaw and the Alabama. The Chickasaw, also at this conference, refused to sign because of their treaty with the Americans. With the signing of these two treaties, McDonald and Ross relocated to Turkeytown to consolidate their efforts and business with those of Campbell closer to their Spanish suppliers and to the British trading house of Panton, Leslie & Company in Pensacola.\\n\\nSponsored by the Spanish, Running Water Town hosted a grand council of western nations and tribes in the summer of 1785 to formulate a strategy for resisting encroachment by settlers from the new United States. Besides the Chickamauga Cherokee, the Upper Muscogee and the Choctaw attended from the South, while representatives from the Shawnee, Lenape, Mingo, Miami, Illinois, Wyandot, Ottawa, Mohawk, Kickapoo, Kaskaskia, Odawa, Potawatomi, Ojibwe, Wabash Confederacy, and the Iroquois League, came from the North. The same parties met again under sponsorship of the British at Detroit in the fall of 1785. The parties at these two councils agreed among themselves and with their sponsors to deal with the Americans as a unit. This laid the groundwork for the confederacy formally established the next year.\\n\\nSection::::Overmountain region.\\nWith these assurances of support, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns renewed raiding the Overmountain settlements that summer. These remained only sporadic until the fall, when an incident between one of the settlers, James Hubbard, and a noted Cherokee leader in the Overhill Towns, Noonday, brought the younger Overhill warriors into the fight and incited them all to more violence. This could be considered the start of a Southwest Indian War, fought by the Cherokee and later the Muscogee too.\\nIn May 1785, the settlements of Upper East Tennessee, then comprising four counties of western North Carolina, petitioned the Congress of the Confederation to be recognized as the \"State of Franklin\". Even though their petition failed to receive the two-thirds votes necessary to qualify, they proceeded to organize what amounted to a secessionist government, holding their first \"state\" assembly in December 1785. One of their chief motives was to retain the foothold they had recently gained in the Cumberland Basin. The Cumberland settlements were included in the government, but being separated by a wide stretch of hostile Cherokee territory, they were essentially autonomous.\\n\\nOne of the first acts of the new State of Franklin was to negotiate with the Overhill Towns the Treaty of Dumplin Creek, signed on June 10, 1785, which ceded the \"territory south of the French Broad and Holston Rivers and west of the Big Pigeon River and east of the ridge dividing Little River from the Tennessee River\" to the State of Franklin.\\n\\nThe Cherokee in the Overhill, Hill, and Valley Towns signed the Treaty of Hopewell with the United States government on November 28, 1785, under duress, the frontier colonials by this time having spread further along the Holston and onto the French Broad. Several leaders from the Lower Cherokee signed, including two from Chickamauga Town (which had been rebuilt) and one from Stecoyee.\\n\\nSection::::Oconee War.\\nIn spring 1785, McGillivray had convened a council of war at the dominant Upper Muscogee town of Tuckabatchee about recent incursions of Georgian settlers into the Oconee territory. The council, attended by most of the nations and tribes of the soon-to-be Western Confederacy, decided to go on the warpath against the trespassers, starting with the recent settlements along the Oconee River. McGillivray had already secured support from the Spanish in New Orleans. This began the Oconee War, which lasted from May 1785 until September 1794.\\n\\nGeorgia officials signed a new treaty with a few compliant Lower Muscogee micos (headmen) in which the latter ceded the land between the Altamaha and St. Mary\\'s Rivers, and from the head of the latter to the Oconee River. They called this wide stretch of land the Tallassee Country, after the tribe which lived there.\\n\\nSection::::Houston County, Georgia.\\nAfter the Hopewell Treaty, the legislature of the State of Georgia, which claimed all of what became Mississippi Territory created Houston County, to take in the Great Bend of the Tennessee River. The project was a joint venture between Georgia and the State of Franklin. To stake their claim, Valentine Sevier and 90 men went south to what is now South Pittsburg, Tennessee, and built a stockaded settlement and blockhouse in early December 1785.\\n\\nThe chosen location lay midway between Nickajack and Long Island towns of the Chickamauga-Lower Cherokee. By mid-January 1786, the pioneers tired of the constant life-or-death fighting and ended the project. The Houston County project collapsed, leaving the name open for the current Houston County, Georgia, established in 1821.\\n\\nIn order to prevent a re-occurrence, the Cherokee established the town of Crowmocker on Battle Creek near the site of the Civil War-era Fort McCook.\\n\\nSection::::Spanish conspiracy.\\nStarting in 1786, the leaders of the State of Franklin and the Cumberland District began secret negotiations with Esteban RodrÃ­guez MirÃ³, governor of Spanish Louisiana, to deliver their regions to the jurisdiction of the Spanish Empire. Those involved included James Robertson, Daniel Smith, and Anthony Bledsoe of the Cumberland District; John Sevier and Joseph Martin of the State of Franklin; James White, recently appointed American Superintendent for Southern Indian Affairs; and James Wilkinson, governor of Kentucky.\\n\\nThe irony lay in the fact that the Spanish backed the Cherokee and Muscogee harassing their territories. MirÃ³\\'s negotiations with Wilkinson, initiated by the latter, to bring Kentucky into Spanish control also were separate but simultaneous. The conspiracy went as far as the Franklin and Cumberland officials promising to take the oath of loyalty to Spain and renounce allegiance to any other nation. Robertson even successfully petitioned the North Carolina assembly create the \"Mero Judicial District\" for the three Cumberland counties (Davidson, Sumner, Tennessee). There was a convention held in the failing State of Franklin on the question, and those present voted in its favor.\\n\\nA large part of their motivation, besides the desire to secede from North Carolina, was the hope that this course of action would bring relief from Indian attacks. The series of negotiations involved Alex McGillivray, with Robertson and Bledsoe writing him of the Miro District\\'s peaceful intentions toward the Muscogee and simultaneously sending White as emissary to Gardoqui to convey news of their overture.\\n\\nSection::::Cherokee war of 1786.\\nConflict erupted largely because of dissatisfaction over the Treaty of Hopewell, the flames of which were fanned by Dragging Canoe. In the east, it primarily involved warriors from the Overhill and Valley Towns against Franklin, while the Lower Towns to the west primarily raided the Cumberland. In large part elated by their crushing defeat of the attempted Houston County, Cherokee warriors from the Lower Towns raided the Franklin settlements in small parties throughout the spring of 1786. First attacking a homestead on Beaver Creek near the newly established White\\'s Fort (at the modern Knoxville, Tennessee) on July 20, they dispersed into small parties raiding the upper Holston and other parts of Franklin. Throughout the summer of 1786, Dragging Canoe and his warriors along with a large contingent of Muscogee raided the Cumberland region, with several parties raiding well into Kentucky.\\n\\nAfter the rise of the \"local\" Cherokee, Sevier responded with a force under joint command of Alexander Outlaw and William Cocke, which drove off the raiders from the Holston before marching for Coyatee near the mouth of the Little Tennessee. Once there, they burned the crops and the town\\'s council house. Meanwhile, Sevier led another expedition across the mountains to attack the Valley Towns on the headwaters of the Hiwassee. The end result was the Treaty of Coyatee on August 3, 1786, in which the State of Franklin forced Corntassel, Hanging Maw, Watts, and the other Overhill leaders to cede the remaining land between the boundary set by the Dumplin Treaty and the Little Tennessee River to the State of Franklin.\\n\\nSection::::Formation of the Western Confederacy.\\nIn addition to the small bands still operating with the Shawnee, Wyandot-Mingo, and Lenape in the Northwest, a large contingent of Cherokee led by The Glass (Tagwadihi) attended and took an active role in a grand council of western tribes (Six Nations Iroquois, Wyandot, Lenape, Shawnee, Odawa, Ojibwe, Potawotami, Twigtis, Wabash Confedracy, and, of course, the Cherokee themselves) lasting November 28 â December 18, 1786, in the Wyandot town of Upper Sandusky just south of the British capital of Detroit. British agents attended, and zealous warriors brought recently acquired scalps.\\n\\nThis meeting, initiated by Joseph Brant, the Mohawk leader who was head chief of the Iroquois Six Nations and like Dragging Canoe fought on the side of the British during the American Revolution, led to the formation of the Western Confederacy to resist American incursions into the Old Northwest. Dragging Canoe and his Cherokee were full members of the Confederacy. The purpose of the Confederacy was to coordinate attacks and defense in the Northwest Indian War of 1785â1795. According to John Norton, Brant\\'s adopted son, it was here in the north that The Glass formed a friendship with his adopted father that lasted well into the 19th century. The passage of the Northwest Ordinance by the Congress of the Confederation in 1787, establishing the Northwest Territory and essentially giving away the land upon which they lived, only exacerbated the resentment of the tribes in the region.\\n\\nSection::::Trouble with Franklin and Kentucky.\\nIn early 1787, encroachments by American settlers became so great that the Overhill Towns held a council on whether to completely abandon their homes on the Little Tennessee for more removed locations to the west. They elected to stay, but the crisis provoked another rise in the small-scale raiding which never really ceased completely. The situation of the Overhill Cherokee was so bad that refugees appeared in Muscogee towns, and the Chickasaw threatened to break the treaty of 1783 and go on the warpath if something were not done to alleviate the situation.\\n\\nThough they provided auxiliary support against Franklin, the Cherokee of the Lower Towns, playing their role as members of the confederacy, had made Kentucky the target of most of their efforts. A sally from the Kentucky militia led by John Logan mistakenly attacked a hunting party from the Overhill Towns and killed several of its members. In their non-apology to Chota, the Kentuckians warned the Overhill Towns to control Dragging Canoe\\'s warriors or there would be widespread indiscriminate revenge.\\n\\nSection::::Coldwater Indian war (1785â1787).\\nAround 1785, Cherokee and Muscogee warriors bgan to gather in Coldwater town, who then attacked the American settlements along the Cumberland and its environs. The fighting contingent eventually numbered approximately 9 Frenchmen, 35 Cherokee, and 10 Muscogee. Because the townsite was well-hidden and its presence unannounced, James Robertson, commander of the militia in the Cumberland\\'s Davidson and Sumner Counties, at first accused the Lower Cherokee of the new offensives. In 1787, he marched his men to their borders in a show of force, but without an actual attack, then sent an offer of peace to Running Water. In answer, Dragging Canoe sent a delegation of leaders led by Little Owl to Nashville under a flag of truce to explain that his Cherokee were not the responsible parties. Meanwhile, the attacks continued.\\n\\nAt the time of the conference in Nashville, two Chickasaw out hunting game along the Tennessee in the vicinity of Muscle Shoals chanced upon Coldwater Town, where they were warmly received and spent the night. Upon returning home to Chickasaw Bluffs, now Memphis, Tennessee, they informed their head man, Piomingo, of their discovery. Piomingo then sent runners to Nashville. Just after these runners had arrived in Nashville, a war party attacked one of its outlying settlements, killing Robertson\\'s brother Mark. In response, Robertson raised a group of 150 volunteers and proceeded south by a circuitous land route, guided by two Chickasaw. Somehow catching the town off guard despite the fact they knew Robertson\\'s force was approaching, they chased its defenders to the river, killing about half of them and wounding many of the rest. They then gathered all the trade goods in the town to be shipped to Nashville by boat, burned the town, and departed. After the wars, Coldwater Town became the site of Colbert\\'s Ferry, owned by Chickasaw leader George Colbert, the crossing place of the Natchez Trace over the Tennessee River.\\n\\nSection::::Post-Revolution: Peak of Cherokee influence (1788â1792).\\nSection::::Cherokee-Franklin war (1788â1789).\\nThe conflict between the Cherokee and the Americans in the State of Franklin erupted into its bloodiest and most widespread since 1776, beginning in late spring and lasting well into the beginning of the following year. One important feature of this conflict was the introduction of large numbers of Muscogee warriors fighting in Cherokee war parties, which continued until the end of the Cherokee wars.\\n\\nSection::::Isolated massacres.\\nIn May 1788, a party of Cherokee from Chilhowee came to the house of John Kirk\\'s family on Little River, while he and his oldest son, John Jr., were out. When Kirk and John Jr. returned, they found the other eleven members of their family dead and scalped. This was the beginning of a Cherokee campaign of raids across the region, to which the frontiers people responded by retreating inside forts and stations.\\n\\nIn May 1788, James Brown of North Carolina departed departed Long-Island-on-the-Holston by boat, destined for the Cumberland to settle there. When they passed by Williams Island in Chattanooga, Bloody Fellow stopped them, looked around the boat, then let them proceed, meanwhile sending messengers ahead to Running Water.\\n\\nUpon the family\\'s arrival at Nickajack, a party of 40 under mixed-blood John Vann boarded the boat and killed Col. Brown, his two older sons on the boat, and five other young men traveling with the family. Mrs. Brown, the two younger sons, and three daughters were taken prisoner and distributed to different families. When he learned of the massacre the following day, The Breath, Nickajack\\'s headman, was angered. He later adopted into his own family the Browns\\' son Joseph as a son. Mrs. Brown and one of her daughters were given to the Muscogee and ended up in the personal household of Alex McGillivray.\\n\\nSection::::Franklinite invasion of the Overhill Towns.\\nIn June 1788, John Sevier, no longer governor of the State of Franklin, raised 100 volunteers and set out for the Overhill Towns. After a brief stop at the Little Tennessee, the group went to Great Hiwassee and burned it to the ground. Then they returned to the Little Tennessee and burned down Tallasee. \\n\\nReturning to Chota, Sevier sent a detachment led by James Hubbard to Chilhowee to punish those responsible for the Kirk massacre. Hubbard\\'s force included John Kirk Jr. Hubbard brought along Corntassel and Hanging Man from Chota. At Chilhowee, Hubbard raised a flag of truce and took Corntassel and Hanging Man to the house of Abraham, still headman of the town. He was there with his son, also bringing along Long Fellow and Fool Warrior. Hubbard posted guards at the door and windows of the cabin, and gave John Kirk Jr. a tomahawk to get his revenge.\\n\\nThe murder of the pacifist Overhill chiefs under a flag of truce angered the entire Cherokee nation. Men who had been reluctant to participate took to the warpath. The increase in hostility lasted for several months. Doublehead, Corntassel\\'s brother, was particularly incensed. Not only did the Cherokee from the Overhill Towns join those from the Lower Towns on the warpath, so too did a large number of Muscogee warriors.\\n\\nHighlighting the seriousness of the matter, Dragging Canoe came to address the general council of the Nation, meeting at Ustanali on the Coosawattee River (one of the former Lower Towns on the Keowee River relocated to the vicinity of Calhoun, Georgia) to which the seat of the council had been moved. The council elected Little Turkey as First Beloved Man to succeed the murdered chief. The election was contested by Hanging Maw of Coyatee; he had been elected chief headman of the traditional Overhill Towns on the Little Tennessee. Both men had been among those who originally followed Dragging Canoe into the southwest.\\n\\nSection::::Siege of Houston\\'s Station.\\nIn August 1788, the commander of the garrison at Houston\\'s Station (near the present Maryville, Tennessee) received word that a Cherokee force of nearly 500 was planning to attack his position. He therefore sent a large reconnaissance patrol to the Overhill Towns.\\n\\nStopping in the town of Citico on the south side of the Little Tennessee, which they found deserted, the patrol scattered throughout the town\\'s orchard and began gathering fruit. Six of them died in the first fusilade, another ten while attempting to escape across the river.\\n\\nWith the loss of those men, the garrison at Houston\\'s Station was seriously beleaguered. Only the arrival of a relief force under John Sevier saved the fort from being overrun and its inhabitants slaughtered. With the garrison joining his force, Sevier marched to the Little Tennessee and burned Chilhowee.\\n\\nSection::::Attempted invasion of the Lower Towns.\\nLater in August, Joseph Martin (who was married to Betsy, daughter of Nancy Ward, and living at Chota), with 500 men, marched to the Chickamauga area, intending to penetrate the edge of the Cumberland Mountains to get to the Five Lower Towns. He sent a detachment to secure the pass over the foot of Lookout Mountain, which was ambushed and routed by a large party of Dragging Canoe\\'s warriors, with the Cherokee in hot pursuit. One of the participants later referred to the spot as \"the place where we made the Virginians turn their backs\". According to one of the participants on the other side, Dragging Canoe, John Watts, Bloody Fellow, Kitegisky, The Glass, Little Owl, and Dick Justice were all present at the encounter.\\n\\nDragging Canoe raised an army of 3,000 Cherokee warriors, which he split into more flexible war bands of hundreds of warriors each. One band was headed by John Watts, with Bloody Fellow, Kitegisky, and The Glass. It included a young warrior named Pathkiller, who later became known as The Ridge.\\n\\nSection::::Battles of Gillespie\\'s Station and others.\\nIn October 1788, Watts\\' band advanced across country toward White\\'s Fort. Along the way, they attacked Gillespie\\'s Station on the Holston River after capturing settlers who had left the enclosure to work in the fields, storming the stockade when the defender\\'s ammunition ran out, killing the men and some of the women and taking 28 women and children prisoner. They then proceeded to attack White\\'s Fort and Houston\\'s Station, only to be beaten back. Afterward, the war band wintered at an encampment on the Flint River in present-day Unicoi County, Tennessee as a base of operations.\\n\\nAn attack by another large party against Sherrill\\'s Station on Nolichucky River was driven off by a force commanded by Sevier. In response to the Cherokee incursions, the settlers increased their retaliatory attacks. Troops under Sevier invaded the Middle and Valley Towns in North Carolina.\\n\\nBob Benge, with a group of Cherokee warriors, evacuated the general population from Ustalli, on the Hiwassee; they left a rearguard to ensure their escape. After firing the town, Sevier and his group pursued the fleeing inhabitants, and were ambushed at the mouth of the Valley River by Benge\\'s party.\\n\\nThe U.S. soldiers went to the village of Coota-cloo-hee and burned down its cornfields, but they were chased off by 400 warriors led by Watts (Young Tassel). Watts\\' army trailed Sevier\\'s all the way from Coota-cloo-hee back to the Franklin settlements, attacking at random. Consequently, the Overhill Cherokee and refugees from the Lower and Valley towns virtually abandoned the settlements on the Little Tennessee and dispersed south and west. Chota was the only Overhill town left with many inhabitants.\\n\\nSection::::Council at Coweta.\\nOn March 2, 1789, the Lower Muscogee chief town of Coweta hosted a council between their division of the Muscogee Confederacy and the Cherokee. As town headman, John Galphin, half-blood son of former Indian Commissioner for the United States George Galphin, presided. Dragging Canoe and Hanging Maw led the Cherokee delegation. The representative of the two nations present agreed they trusted neither the Americans nor the Spanish and drafted a letter to the government of Great Britain, pledging their loyalty in return for the king\\'s direct assistance. They promised that if this happened, then the Mohawk, the Choctaw, and the Chickasaw would come over. Nothing ever came of the petition.\\n\\nSection::::Prisoner exchange.\\nJohn Watts\\' band on Flint Creek fell upon serious misfortune in January 1789. They were surrounded by a force under John Sevier that was equipped with grasshopper cannons. The gunfire from the Cherokee was so intense, however, that Sevier abandoned his heavy weapons and ordered a cavalry charge that led to savage hand-to-hand fighting. Watt\\'s band lost nearly 150 warriors.\\n\\nWord of their defeat did not reach Running Water until April, when it arrived with an offer from Sevier for an exchange of prisoners which specifically mentioned the surviving members of the Brown family, including Joseph, who had been adopted first by Kitegisky and later by The Breath. Among those captured at Flint Creek were Bloody Fellow and Little Turkey\\'s daughter.\\n\\nJoseph and his sister Polly were brought immediately to Running Water, but when runners were sent to Crow Town to retrieve Jane, their youngest sister, her owner refused to surrender her. Bob Benge, present in Running Water at the time, mounted his horse and hefted his famous axe, saying, \"I will bring the girl, or the owner\\'s head\". The next morning he returned with Jane. The three were handed over to Sevier at Coosawattee on April 20. McGillivray delivered Mrs. Brown and Elizabeth to her son William during a trip to Rock Landing, Georgia, in November. George, the other surviving son from the trip, remained with the Muscogee until 1798.\\n\\nSection::::Non-treaty of Swannanoa.\\nThe next month, on May 25, 1789, the Cherokee were supposed to sign a peace treaty with the United States at the War Ford on the French Broad River, near Swannanoa, North Carolina. The Americans chose the location because it was scene of a major Cherokee defeat in 1776. The Cherokee leaders never showed, but when the Americans under Andrew Pickens ran across Cherokee on their way to Rock Landing on the Oconee River to meet with the Muscogee, they were assured hostilities were over.\\n\\nSection::::Doublehead\\'s war.\\nThe opposite end of Muscle Shoals from Coldwater Town was occupied in 1790 by a roughly 40-strong warrior party under Doublehead. He had gained permission to establish his town at the head of the Shoals, which was in Chickasaw territory, because the local headman, George Colbert, the mixed-blood leader who later owned Colbert\\'s Ferry at the foot of Muscle Shoals, was his son-in-law.\\n\\nLike the former Coldwater Town, Doublehead\\'s Town was diverse, with Cherokee, Muscogee, Shawnee, and a few Chickasaw. It quickly grew beyond the initial 40 warriors, who carried out many small raids against settlers on the Cumberland and into Kentucky. During one foray in June 1792, his warriors ambushed a canoe carrying the three sons of Valentine Sevier (brother of John) and three others on a scouting expedition searching for his party. They killed the three Seviers and another man; two escaped.\\n\\nDoublehead conducted his operations largely independently of the Lower Cherokee, though he did take part in large operations with them on occasion, such as the invasion of the Cumberland in 1792 and that of the Holston in 1793.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty of New York (1790).\\nDragging Canoe\\'s long-time ally among the Muscogee, Alex McGillivray, led a delegation of twenty-seven leaders north, where they signed the Treaty of New York in August 1790 with the United States government on behalf of the \"Upper, Middle, and Lower Creek and Seminole composing the Creek nation of Indians\". In it, McGillivray, who was made an America brigadier general, ceded in the name of the Confederacy the Oconee Country. In return the federal government upheld Muscogee rights to all of the Tallassee Country.\\n\\nAlthough intended to end the Oconee War, it angered the American settlers expelled from the Tallassee Country and Muscogee who wanted to keep the Oconee Country, so the war continued. The treaty also marked the beginning of the decline of McGillivray\\'s influence in the Muscogee Confederacy and the rise of that of William Augustus Bowles, a bitter rival dating back to the Spanish campaign against Pensacola. By mid-1791, Bowles wielded enough influence to send large war parties raiding the Cumberland once again despite the treaty.\\n\\nSection::::Muscle Shoals settlement.\\nIn January 1791, a group of land speculators named the Tennessee Company from the Southwest Territory, led by James Hubbard and Peter Bryant, attempted to gain control of the Muscle Shoals and its vicinity by building a settlement and fort at the head of the Shoals. They did so against an executive order of President Washington forbidding it, as relayed to them by the governor of the Southwest Territory, William Blount. The Glass came down from Running Water with 60 warriors and descended upon the defenders, captained by Valentine Sevier, brother of John. The Glass told them to leave immediately or be killed, then burned their blockhouse as they departed.\\n\\nSection::::Bob Benge\\'s war.\\nStarting in 1791, Benge and his brother The Tail, based at Willstown, began leading attacks against settlers in East Tennessee, Southwest Virginia, and Kentucky, often in conjunction with Doublehead and his warriors from Coldwater. Eventually, he became one of the most feared warriors on the frontier.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty of Holston (1791).\\nThe Treaty of Holston, signed in July 1791, required the Upper Towns to cede more land in return for continued peace because the U.S. government proved unable to stop or roll back illegal settlements. As it appeared to guarantee Cherokee sovereignty, the chiefs of the Upper Cherokee believed they had the same status as states. Several representatives of the Lower Cherokee participated in the negotiations and signed the treaty, including John Watts, Doublehead, Bloody Fellow, Black Fox (Dragging Canoe\\'s nephew), The Badger (his brother), and Rising Fawn.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of the Wabash.\\nLater in the summer, a small delegation of Cherokee under Dragging Canoe\\'s brother Little Owl traveled north to meet with the Indian leaders of the Western Confederacy, chief among them Blue Jacket of the Shawnee, Little Turtle of the Miami, and Buckongahelas of the Lenape. While they were there, word arrived that Arthur St. Clair, Governor of the Northwest Territory, was planning an invasion against the allied tribes in the north. Little Owl immediately sent word south to Running Water.\\n\\nDragging Canoe quickly sent a 30-strong war party north under his brother The Badger, where, along with the warriors of Little Owl and Turtle-at-Home they participated in the decisive encounter in November 1791 known as the Battle of the Wabash, the worst defeat ever inflicted by Native Americans upon the American military, the American military body count of which far surpassed that at the more famous Battle of the Little Bighorn in 1876.\\n\\nAfter the battle, Little Owl, The Badger, and Turtle-at-Home returned south with most of the warriors who had accompanied the first two. The warriors who had come north years earlier remained in the Ohio region, but the returning warriors brought back a party of 30 Shawnee under the leadership of one known as Shawnee Warrior that frequently operated alongside warriors under Little Owl.\\n\\nSection::::Death of Dragging Canoe.\\nInspired by news of the northern victory, Dragging Canoe embarked on a mission to unite the native people of his area as had Little Turtle and Blue Jacket by visiting the other major tribes in the region. His embassies to the Lower Muscogee and the Choctaw were successful, but the Chickasaw living to the west refused his overtures. Upon his return, which coincided with that of The Glass and Dick Justice, and of Turtle-at-Home, a huge all-night celebration was held at Stecoyee at which the Eagle Dance was performed in his honor.\\n\\nBy the morning of March 1, 1792, Dragging Canoe was dead, as a result of exhaustion from dancing all night, or possibly a heart attack. A procession of honor carried his body to Running Water, where he was buried. By the time of his death, the resistance of the Chickamauga/Lower Cherokee had led to grudging respect from the settlers, as well as the rest of the Cherokee nation. He was even memorialized at the general council of the Nation held in Ustanali on June 28, 1792, by his nephew Black Fox:\\n\\n\"The Dragging Canoe has left this world. He was a man of consequence in his country. He was friend to both his own and the white people. His brother\" [Little Owl] \"is still in place, and I mention it now publicly that I intend presenting him with his deceased brother\\'s medal; for he promises fair to possess sentiments similar to those of his brother, both with regard to the red and the white. It is mentioned here publicly that both red and white may know it, and pay attention to him\".\\n\\nThe minutes of the council list Little Turkey as \"Great Beloved Man of the whole Nation\", Hanging Maw as \"Beloved Man of the Northern Division\" (Overhill Towns), and The Badger as \"Beloved Man of the Southern Division\" (Upper Towns in North Georgia).\\n\\nSuch was the respect for him as a leader and patriot of his people that Governor Blount, leader of his greatest enemies, remarked upon hearing of his death that, \"Dragging Canoe stood second to none in the Nation\".\\n\\nSection::::Post-Revolution: the Watts years (1792â1795).\\nAt his own previous request, Dragging Canoe was succeeded as leader of the Lower Cherokee by John Watts, although The Bowl succeeded him as headman of Running Water. Bloody Fellow and Doublehead continued Dragging Canoe\\'s policy of Indian unity, including an agreement with McGillivray of the Upper Muscogee to build joint blockhouses from which warriors of both tribes could operate at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers, at Running Water and at Muscle Shoals.\\n\\nWatts, Tahlonteeskee, and \\'Young Dragging Canoe\\' (whose actual name was \"Tsula\", or \"Red Fox\") traveled to Pensacola in May at the invitation of Arturo O\\'Neill de Tyrone, Spanish governor of West Florida. They took with them letters of introduction from John McDonald. Once there, they forged a treaty with O\\'Neill for arms and supplies. Upon returning north, Watts moved his base of operations to Willstown.\\n\\nMeanwhile, John McDonald, now British Indian Affairs Superintendent, moved to Turkeytown with his assistant Daniel Ross and their families. Some of the older chiefs, such as The Glass of Running Water, The Breath of Nickajack, and Dick Justice of Stecoyee, abstained from active warfare but did nothing to stop the warriors in their towns from taking part in raids and campaigns.\\n\\nThe Trans-Appalachian communities formerly of North Carolina became the Southwest Territory of the United States in 1790. For administrative purposes, the territorial government grouped the counties in the Overmountain region together as the Washington District, while those in the Cumberland region became the Mero District, already the name for its judicial district since 1788.\\n\\nCherokee and Muscogee warriors and their Shawnee guests began raiding both districts of the Southwest Territory. In April 1792, a Cherokee-Shawnee war party led by Bob Benge and Shawnee Warrior invaded the Holston region and began raids all over the vicinity. In the summer of 1792, a war party from Running Water led by Little Owl and the Shawnee Warrior joined them in their raids. On June 26, the same day that Dragging Canoe was being memorialized at the national council in Ustanali, the combined group of Cherokee, Shawnee, and a few Muscogee destroyed Zeigler\\'s Station in Sumner County. This action led the Governor James Robertson of the Mero District to call up a battalion of troops to spread throughout the region as guards.\\n\\nSection::::Invasion of the Mero District.\\nOn September 7 or 8, 1792, a council of Cherokee meeting at Running Water formally declared war against the United States. Watts orchestrated a large campaign intending to attack the Washington District with a large combined army in four bands of 200 each. When the warriors were mustering at Stecoyee, however, he learned that their planned attack was expected and decided to aim for the Mero District instead. The army Watts led into the Cumberland region was nearly 1,000 strong, including a contingent of cavalry.\\n\\nFrom their launch point, Tahlonteeskee (Doublehead\\'s brother) and The Tail (Bob Benge\\'s brother) led a party to ambush the Kentucky Road. Doublehead led another to the Cumberland Road. Middle Striker led his party to do the same on the Walton Road. Watts led the main force, made up of 280 Cherokee, Shawnee, and Muscogee warriors plus cavalry, intending to go against the fort at Nashville. He sent out George Fields and John Walker, Jr., as scouts ahead of the army, and they killed the two scouts sent out by James Robertson from Nashville.\\n\\nNear their target on the evening of September 30, Watts\\'s combined force came upon a small fort known as Buchanan\\'s Station, commanded by John Buchanan. Talotiskee, leader of the Muscogee, wanted to attack it immediately, while Watts argued in favor of saving it for the return south. After much bickering, Watts gave in around midnight. The assault proved to be a disaster for Watts. Watts was wounded, and many of his warriors were killed, including Talotiskee and some of Watts\\' best leaders; Shawnee Warrior, Kitegisky, and Dragging Canoe\\'s brother Little Owl were among those who died in the encounter.\\n\\nDoublehead\\'s group of 60 ambushed a party of 6 and took one scalp then headed toward Nashville. On their way, they were attacked by a militia force and lost 13 men. Tahlonteeskee\\'s party, meanwhile, stayed out into early October, attacking Black\\'s Station on Crooked Creek, killing three, wounding more, and capturing several horses. Middle Striker\\'s party ambushed a large armed force coming to the Mero District down the Walton Road in November and routed it completely without losing a single man.\\n\\nIn revenge for the deaths at Buchanan\\'s Station, Benge, Doublehead, and his brother Pumpkin Boy led a party of 60 into southwestern Kentucky in early 1793 during which their warriors, in an act initiated by Doublehead, cooked and ate the enemies they had just killed. Afterwards, Doublehead\\'s party returned south and held scalp dances at Stecoyee, Turnip Town, and Willstown, since warriors from those towns had also participated in the raid in addition to his and Benge\\'s groups.\\n\\nSection::::Spring and summer campaigns, 1793.\\nA party of Muscogee under a mixed-race warrior named Lesley began attacking isolated farmsteads. Lesley\\'s party continued harassment of the Holston settlements until the summer of 1794. Lesley\\'s group was not the only Muscogee party, nor were the Muscogee alone. Warriors from the Upper Towns and some from the Overhill and Valley Towns, also raided the eastern districts in the spring and summer of 1793.\\n\\nIn the Mero District, besides scalping raids, two parties attacked Bledsoe\\'s Station and Greenfield Station in April 1793. Another party attacked Hays\\' Station in June. In August, the Coushatta from Coosada raided the country around Clarksville, Tennessee, attacking the homestead of the Baker family, killing all but two who escaped and one taken prisoner who was later ransomed at Coosada Town.\\n\\nSection::::Peace overtures.\\nAfter the visit of the Shawnee, Watts sent envoys to Knoxville, then the capital of the Southwest Territory, to meet with Governor William Blount to discuss terms for peace. The party that was sent from the Lower Towns that May included Bob McLemore, Tahlonteeskee, Captain Charley of Running Water, and Doublehead, among several others. They met at Henry\\'s Station on February 4, 1793, and Blount invited the Lower Cherokee to send a delegation to the Philadelphia to meet with President Washington.\\nThe meeting in Philadelphia was scheduled for June 1793. On the way, the diplomatic party from the Lower Towns stopped in Coyatee because Hanging Maw and other chiefs from the Upper Towns were going also. A large party of Lower Cherokee had been raiding the Upper East, killed two men, and stole twenty horses. On their way out, they passed through Coyatee, to which the pursuit party tracked them. \\n\\nThe militia violated their orders not to cross the Little Tennessee, then the border between the Cherokee nation and the Southwest Territory, firing indiscriminately. In the ensuing chaos, 11 leading men were killed, including Captain Charley, and several wounded, including Hanging Maw, his wife and daughter, Doublehead, and Tahlonteeskee; one of the white delegates was among the dead. The Cherokee, including Watts\\' hostile warriors, agreed to await the outcome of the subsequent trial. The trial proved to be a farce, in large part because John Beard, the man responsible, was a close friend of John Sevier.\\n\\nSection::::Invasion of the Eastern Districts.\\nWatts responded to Beard\\'s acquittal by invading the Holston area with one of the largest Indian forces ever seen in the region, over 1,000 Cherokee and Muscogee, plus a few Shawnee, intending to attack Knoxville. The plan was to have four bodies of troops march toward Knoxville separately, converging at a rendezvous point along the way.\\n\\nIn August, Watts attacked Henry\\'s Station with a force of 200 but fell back after sustaining overwhelming gunfire coming from the fort. The four columns converged a month later near the present Loudon, Tennessee, and proceeded toward their target. On the way, the Cherokee leaders were discussing among themselves whether to kill all the inhabitants of Knoxville, or just the men, James Vann advocating the latter while Doublehead argued for the former.\\n\\nFurther on the way, they encountered a small settlement called Cavett\\'s Station on September 25, 1793. After they had surrounded the place, Benge negotiated with the inhabitants, agreeing that if they surrendered, their lives would be spared. However, after the settlers had walked out, Doublehead\\'s group and his Muscogee allies attacked and began killing them, over the pleas of Benge and the others. Vann managed to grab one small boy and pull him onto his saddle, only to have Doublehead smash the boy\\'s skull with an axe. Watts intervened in time to save another young boy, handing him to Vann, who put the boy behind him on his horse and later handed him over to three of the Muscogee for safe-keeping; one of the Muscogee chiefs killed the boy and scalped him a few days later.\\n\\nBecause of this incident, Vann called Doublehead \"Babykiller\" (deliberately parodying the honorable title \"Mankiller\") for the remainder of his life; and it also began a lengthy feud which defined the politics of the early 19th century Cherokee Nation and only ended in 1807 with Doublehead\\'s death at Vann\\'s orders. By this time, tensions among the Cherokee broke out into such vehement arguments that the force broke up, with the main group retiring south.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of Hightower.\\nSevier countered the invasion with an invasion and occupation of Ustanali, which had been deserted; there was no fighting there other than an indecisive skirmish with a Cherokee-Muscogee scouting party. He and his men then followed the Cherokee-Muscogee force south to the town of Etowah (near the site of present-day Cartersville, Georgia across the Etowah River from the Etowah Indian Mounds), leading to the \"Battle of Hightower\" on October 17, 1793. His force defeated their opponents soundly, then went on to destroy several Cherokee villages to the west before retiring to the Southwest Territory. The battle was the last pitched battle of the wars between the Cherokee and the American frontier people.\\n\\nSection::::Spring and summer 1794.\\nBetween January and September 1794, there were more than forty raids by war parties of both Cherokee and Muscogee on the Mero District. On the part of the Cherokee, these were mostly carried out by Doublehead. These raids precipitated the Nickajack Expedition in September which ended the CherokeeâAmerican wars once and for all.\\n\\nMeanwhile, Bob Benge attacked Washington District and Southwest Virginia, losing his life in the latter on April 6, 1794. The militia sent his red-haired scalp to Governor Henry Lee III. Benge was not alone in raiding the Eastern Districts. Fifty horses were stolen in the region that same month. Twenty-five warriors attacked the Town Creek blockhouse. An entire family save one was massacred south of the French Broad. There were many other attacks.\\n\\nFrustrated with the governor\\'s call for restraint, John Beard, leader of the chase group that attacked the diplomatic party, organized a party of 150 men in the Washington District and attacked the Hiwasee Towns, burning two, including Great Hiwassee, and killing several Cherokee. Against orders, George Doherty of the Hamilton District militia mustered his men and attacked Great Tellico, burning it to the ground, then crossed the mountains into the Valley Towns, in which they burned at least two towns and several acres of crops.\\n\\nOn June 9, 1794, a party of Cherokee under Whitemankiller (George Fields) overtook a river party under William Scott at Muscle Shoals. They killed its white passengers, looted the goods, and took the African-American slaves as captives.\\n\\nOn June 26, 1794, the federal government and the Cherokee signed the Treaty of Philadelphia, which essentially reaffirmed the land cessions of the 1785 Treaty of Hopwell and the 1791 Treaty of Holston. Both the Doublehead and Bloody Fellow signed it.\\n\\nSection::::End of Lesley\\'s war party.\\nIn July 1794, Hanging Maw sent his men along with the volunteers from the Holston settlements to pursue Lesley\\'s Muscogee war party, killing two and handing over a third to the whites for trial and execution on August 4. Two days later, a small war party of Muscogee crossed the Tennessee River at Chestua Creek in modern Bradley County. Hanging Maw called up his warriors, 50 of whom joined with federal troops in pursuit, while the rest guarded Coyatee. They caught up with the party they were pursuing on August 12 near Craig\\'s Station and defeated them. Different Muscogee war parties, however, escaped their pursuers and attacked the Holston frontier for the rest of the month.\\n\\nSection::::Nickajack Expedition and peace treaty.\\nDesiring to end the wars once and for all, Robertson sent a detachment of U.S. regular troops, Mero District militia, and Kentucky volunteers to the Five Lower Towns under U.S. Army Major James Ore. Guided by knowledgeable locals, including former captive Joseph Brown, Ore\\'s army traveled down the Cisca and St. Augustine Trail toward the Five Lower Towns.\\n\\nOn September 13, the army attacked Nickajack without warning, slaughtering many of the inhabitants, including its pacifist chief The Breath. After torching the houses, the soldiers went upriver and burned Running Water, whose residents had long fled. Joseph Brown fought alongside the soldiers but tried to spare women and children. The Cherokee casualties were relatively light, as the majority of the population of both towns were in Willstown attending a major stickball game.\\n\\nWatts finally decided to call for peace: he was discouraged by the destruction of the two towns, the death of Bob Benge in April, and the recent defeat of the Western Confederacy by General \"Mad Anthony\" Wayne\\'s army at the Battle of Fallen Timbers. More than 100 Cherokee had fought there. The loss of support from the Spanish, who had their own problems against France in the War of the First Coalition, convinced Watts to end the fighting. \\n\\nOn November 7, 1794, he made the Treaty of Tellico Blockhouse. It was notable for not requiring any more land cessions by the Cherokee, other than finally ended the series of conflicts, which was notable for not requiring any further cession of land other than requiring the Lower Cherokee to recognize the cessions of the Holston Treaty. This led to a period of relative peace into the 19th century.\\n\\nThe Muscogee kept on fighting after the destruction of Nickajack and Running Water and the following peace between the Lower Cherokee and the United States. In October 1794, they attacked Bledsoe\\'s Station again. In November, they attacked Sevier\\'s Station and massacred fourteen of the inhabitants, Valentine Sevier being one of the few survivors.\\n\\nIn December 1794, a force of Cherokee warriors from the Upper Towns stopped a Muscogee campaign against the frontier settlements of the state of Georgia and warned them to cease attacking the Southwest Territory\\'s Eastern Districts as well. In early January 1795, however, the Chickasaw, who had sent warriors to take part in the Army of the Northwest, began killing Muscogee warriors found in Middle Tennessee as allies of the United States and taking their scalps, so in March, the Muscogee began to turn their attentions away from the Cumberland to the Chickasaw, over the entreaties of the Cherokee and the Choctaw.\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath.\\nFollowing the peace treaty, leaders from the Lower Cherokee were dominant in national affairs. When the national government of all the Cherokee was organized, the first three persons to hold the office of Principal Chief of the Cherokee Nation â Little Turkey (1788â1801), Black Fox (1801â1811), and Pathkiller (1811â1827) â had previously served as warriors under Dragging Canoe, as had the first two Speakers of the Cherokee National Council, established in 1794, Doublehead and Turtle-at-Home.\\n\\nThe domination of the Cherokee Nation by the former warriors from the Lower Towns continued well into the 19th century. Even after the revolt of the young chiefs of the Upper Towns, the Lower Towns were a major voice, and the \"young chiefs\" of the Upper Towns who dominated that region had themselves previously been warriors with Dragging Canoe and Watts.\\n\\nBecause of the continuing hostilities that followed the Revolution, the United States placed one of the two permanent garrisons of the new country at Fort Southwest Point at the confluence of the Tennessee and Clinch Rivers; the other was at Fort Pitt in Pennsylvania. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'CherokeeâAmerican wars', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7666345'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'lQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7670', 'text': 'Central Coast\\n\\nCentral Coast may refer to:\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Central Coast', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7670', 'cat_id': '7670', 'cat_title': '1574_births', 'cat_pages': '133', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'lgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7670177', 'text': \"Dermot Keely\\n\\nDermot Keely (born 8 March 1954) is an Irish former manager and player.\\n\\nSection::::Family.\\nKeely's family have played League of Ireland football at various levels. His late father Peter Keely played for Shelbourne, his brother Joe played on the same Home Farm FAI Cup winning side of 1975 as Dermot himself. And his son Alan Keely also played in the League of Ireland.\\n\\nSection::::Player.\\nAs a player Keely started with Home Farm and then signed for St. Patrick's Athletic under Barry Bridges who appointed him club captain. He played with Terry Venables while at Richmond Park (football ground). In June 1977 he was about to depart for Adelaide on a 2-year contract when the deal fell through.\\n\\nHe then moved to Dundalk where he made his debut against Shamrock Rovers in September 1978. In his first season the County Louth outfit won the domestic double. In 1981 Keely captained Dundalk to win the FAI Cup. The League Cup was also won this season.\\n\\nKeely then signed for Glentoran in the Irish League where in his two seasons there he won the Irish Cup, a Gold Cup and an Ulster Cup.\\n\\nKeely's time with Dundalk and Glentoran saw him play in notable European Cup ties. In 1979, Dundalk reached the second round of the 1979â80 European Cup and were drawn with Celtic. The first leg saw Dundalk produce a notable display to come away with a 3â2 defeat at Parkhead. In the return leg in front of a packed Oriel Park with Keely as captain, Dundalk missed a last-minute opportunity to win the tie on away goals and the game finished 0â0 . This is regarded as one of the best performances by a League of Ireland club in European competition.\\n\\nTwo years later, Keely played his part in Glentoran's run to the second round of the European Cup. In the first leg against CSKA Sofia, they lost 2â0. However, the return leg saw Glentoran take a 2â0 lead, forcing the game into extra time. With only five minutes remaining, CSKA scored the goal they needed. The tie finished 3â2 on aggregate, which had been the closest Glentoran came to reaching the last eight of European competition since 1974.\\n\\nSection::::Player-manager.\\nKeely's first managerial job was as UCD player-manager. However, after just two months at Belfield Jim McLaughlin (football manager) persuaded Keely to sign for Shamrock Rovers. He made his debut against Athlone Town in November 1983. He scored his first goal for Rovers in a 3â2 defeat to Shelbourne at Harold's Cross on 11 December 1983. When McLaughlin left at the end of the 1985/86 season to manage his home club Derry City Dermot was appointed player-manager on 16 May.\\n\\nIn the 1986/87 season, Rovers owners controversially announced the sale of Glenmalure Park near the end of season. However, Rovers won another double in this their final season at Milltown to bring Keely's Rovers haul to 4 League championships and 3 FAI Cups.\\n\\nThe 1987/88 season started with Rovers controversially playing at Tolka Park. Rovers fans boycotted the ground en masse. Every game was picketed and with the crowds practically gone the team invariably suffered. Keely was quoted years later as saying: \\n\\nHe resigned after the last game of the season on 8 April 1988. During his time at Rovers he won one Inter-League cap and represented the club 6 times in European competition.\\n\\nIn May 1988 Keely signed for Bray Wanderers However, he never played for the Seasiders and by November Keely was player/assistant manager to Ray Treacy at Home Farm F.C..\\n\\nSection::::Manager.\\nHe then took over as manager of Sligo Rovers in 1989 and achieved promotion in his first season. He guided Sligo Rovers to their highest Premier Division place in a decade in the 1990/91 season by finishing 5th.\\n\\nAfter a brief spell at Longford Town he took over at Dundalk where he won the League Championship in 1995. He then guided Finn Harps to promotion to the Premier Division in 1996. After managing Athlone Town he took over the reins at Home Farm Everton where he won the League of Ireland First Division Shield in 1998.\\n\\nIn the calendar year 1996 Keely managed four clubs: Dundalk, Finn Harps, Athlone Town and Home Farm.\\nHe took over as manager of Shelbourne in July 1998 and won two championships (1999â2000 and 2001â02) and one FAI Cup (2000) in his time at Tolka Park. He also guided Shels to victory over Macedonian side Sloga Jugomagnat in the first round of the 2000â01 UEFA Champions League qualifiers. Shels 1â0 win in the first leg in Skopje was the first away win for a League of Ireland side in any UEFA competitions for eighteen years.\\n\\nKeely then became the first manager of new league club Kildare County in 2002. After a credible 5th-place finish he then walked out to manage Derry City lasting only 3 months\\n\\nAfter a spell out of the game he then took over at Dublin City. He then took over the management position at Shelbourne FC in 2007 and in his first season back finished fifth in the first division. In his second season in charge, Shelbourne lead the division going into the final game, and needed a home win against mid-table Limerick to gain promotion, but were denied by a 92nd-minute equaliser, and so were overhauled by Dundalk, who won away to Kildare County. On 27 May 2010, Keely stepped down as manager of Shelbourne to become Shelbourne's youth team manager and community development officer.\\n\\nKeely has also been working as a Maths and English teacher in De La Salle College Churchtown for over 20 years until he retired at Christmas 2011 he also has a weekly column in the Irish Sun.\\n\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Dermot Keely', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7670177'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'lwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7671062', 'text': 'Real estate owned\\n\\nReal estate owned or REO is a term used in the United States to describe a class of property owned by a lenderâtypically a bank, government agency, or government loan insurerâafter an unsuccessful sale at a foreclosure auction. A foreclosing beneficiary will typically set the opening bid at a foreclosure auction for at least the outstanding loan amount. If there are no bidders that are interested, then the beneficiary will legally repossess the property. This is commonly the case when the amount owed on the home is higher than the current market value of this foreclosure property, such as with a high loan-to-value mortgage following a real estate bubble. As soon as the beneficiary repossesses the property it is listed on their books as REO and categorized as an asset. (See \"non-performing asset\").\\n\\nSection::::Origin.\\nThe term originates from the term \"other real estate owned\" (OREO), which is used on financial statements to classify real estate property owned by a financial institution but which is not directly related to its business. These financial institutions are often the lender. Lenders are primarily in the business of making loans with the intent that nearly all of those loans will be repaid in full with interest. Seizing, managing and reselling real property collateral to recover unpaid loan balances is secondary to lenders\\' primary line of business. Property management companies, for whom real estate management \"is\" their primary business, use the term OREO. \\n\\nIn balance sheet terms, OREO assets are considered non-earning assets for purposes of regulatory accounting. In the context of national banks in the U.S., the term OREO is legally defined by the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency in regulations promulgated pursuant to , specifically in and .\\n\\nSection::::Process.\\nAs soon as a property goes into a distressed status (the borrower/home owner misses mortgage payments) the beneficiary will want to determine the amount of equity that the property has. A popular method to determine the equity is to obtain a Broker\\'s Price Opinion (BPO) or order an appraisal. Based on the amount of equity that is determined from the BPO, the bank will decide whether to allow a short sale (if requested by the homeowner). If no short sale is requested by the home owner, the beneficiary will continue the foreclosure process. If the beneficiary is unable to sell the property through a short sale or at a foreclosure auction it will now become an REO property. \\n\\nAfter a repossession from which the property becomes classified as REO, the beneficiary will go through the process of trying to sell the property on its own or obtain the service of an REO Asset Manager. The beneficiary will remove the liens and other debts on the home and try to resell it to the public, either through future auctions, direct marketing through a real estate broker, or by itself. The asset manager may also try to contact REO realtors that specialize in certain ZIP codes to help sell this bank owned property. Real estate investors will often purchase these properties because of discounts offered to compensate for the condition of the property.\\n\\nMany larger banks and government institutions have REO/asset management departments that field bids and offers, oversee up keep, and handle sales. Some REO properties on the open market will be listed in MLS by the broker who performed the BPO. \\n\\nSection::::Property preservation.\\nBank REO properties are generally in poor condition and need repairs and maintenance, both to satisfy property upkeep laws and to preserve and prepare the property for sale. Maintenance is generally the responsibility of the mortgage servicer and is often in turn provided by a specialized property preservation company. These \"property preservation services\" include: securing a property (changing locks, boarding up), debris removal, property maintenance (winterizing, cutting grass, repairing or tarping roof leaks), and rehabilitation.\\n\\nIn addition to preventing damage to the property, securing a property is used to prevent or discourage re-entry by former occupants or by squatters, which can both damage the property and require legal proceedings to remove, further complicating a sale. Swimming pools must also be secured to prevent deaths or injuries from drowning and falls.\\n\\nLenders may purchase \"real estate owned\" insurance to protect against loss and liability relating to lender-owned properties. REO insurance differs from \"forced placed\" insurance (also \"lender placed\" insurance), which a lender purchases for borrower-owned property when the borrower does not insure the property.\\n\\nSection::::Bulk real estate owned.\\nBulk REO or bulk real estate owned, from a real estate investorâs point of view, is like investing on wholesale real estate properties. On the other hand, banks or lenders sell or open their assets in group for auction at a very low price compared to their market value. \\n', 'title': 'Real estate owned', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7671062'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'mAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7673868', 'text': \"Francisco 'Paco' Bautista\\n\\nFrancisco 'Paco' Bautista is an IFBB professional bodybuilder.

The brig was \"Resolution\", a sloop of war, of 18 guns and 149 men, under the command of Don Francisco Darrichena. She was the former British navy cutter \"Resolution\" and had sailed from Vera Cruz three days earlier. After securing the prize, \"Apollo\" set out after the xebec, sighting her an hour after daybreak. \"Apollo\" finally captured the xebec \"Marte\", of 75 tons, at three in the afternoon. She had been sailing from Vera Cruz for Havana. \"Apollo\" towed \"Resolution\" until 27 November, when she lost her mast. \"Resolution\" was in such an irreparable state Halkett destroyed her. Then on 7 December \"Apollo\" captured the schooner \"St Joseph\", of 70 tons.\\n\\nIn addition to these three vessels, between 3 August 1800 and 3 January 1801, \"Apollo\" captured two other Spanish merchant vessels:\\n\\nOn 18 February 1801, \"Apollo\" captured the French 14-gun privateer \"Vigilante\". \\n\\nHead money for \"Aquilla\", \"Cantabria\" and \"Vigilante\" was paid in August 1828.

At 3:30 in the morning of 2 April, \"Apollo\" unexpectedly ran aground when their calculations showed them well offshore. In the morning \"Apollo\" discovered that she had run aground about nine miles south of Cape Mondego on the coast of Portugal. Twenty-five or six of the vessels in the convoy, traveling closely behind due to the low visibility and bad weather, were also wrecked. Next day some more vessels wrecked. In all, 29 vessels ran aground. \\n\\nAll the boats of the frigate were destroyed, and it took two days to transfer \"Apollo\"s crew to land. Sixty-two officers and men died; around twenty of the crew died in the first few hours, but most perished of exposure waiting to be rescued. The number of dead in the merchant vessels is not known, but the \"Naval Chronicle\" reported that \"dead bodies were every day floating ashore, and pieces of wreck covered the beach upwards of ten miles.\" \\n\\n\"Carysfort\" had shifted course on the evening of 1 April, and so escaped grounding. She gathered the 38 surviving vessels and proceeded with the convoy.\\n\\nAt the time, accounts blamed strong currents. Later it was discovered that \"Apollo\" had taken on board an iron tank, but that no one had adjusted her compass for the influence of this large magnetic mass. Consequently, a small error in direction accumulated over the course of the five days; at the time \"Apollo\" struck Dixon thought she was forty or so miles out to sea. Because the convoy had endured bad weather since leaving Cork, no one had taken sightings that would have enabled them to correct their estimates of their position.

He succeeded his uncle-in-law Guo Wei, whose surname he had adopted.\\n\\nEmperor Shizong is considered a highly successful emperor of the Five Dynasties period. He centralized military power by his reforms, and proved his military prowess by a series of victories against Northern Han, Later Shu, Southern Tang, and the Liao Dynasty. Although his accomplishments were limited due to his premature death, they paved way for Chinese reunification later completed by the Song Dynasty, founded by his trusted general Zhao Kuangyin.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nChai Rong was born in Xingzhou (é¢å·; modern Xingtai, Hebei). As a child he came to live with his aunt â a younger sister of his father Chai Shouli (æ´å®ç¦®) â and her husband Guo Wei, an official in the Later Tang military. The Guos had no sons, so they adopted the quiet nephew as their own. The youngster grew up into a muscular young man skilled at mounted archery, while also possessing a basic understanding of Chinese classics, history, and the Huang-Lao philosophy.\\n\\nSection::::Career under Later Han.\\nAfter the establishment of the Later Han in 947, the Guo family's condition improved dramatically. Guo Wei became the commissioner of military affairs (æ¨å¯ä½¿) in 948, and his adopted son became the left commandant for palace-gate security (å·¦å éè¡å°è»). On 4 May 950, Guo was promoted to military governor of Tianxiong Command (å¤©éè») and delegated to garrison at Weizhou (é­å·; modern Linzhang County, Hebei) at the Later Han-Liao Dynasty border to prevent a possible Liao incursion. Ten days later, his adopted son was appointed Tianxiong Command's chief director of military headquarters (çå§é½ææ®ä½¿) to follow him in Weizhou. Chai Rong â by now known as Guo Rong â was also given a nominal post of prefect of Guizhou (è²´å·).\\n\\nIn 950, the Later Han emperor Liu Chengyou unexpectedly killed the entire family of Guo Wei as a plot to liquidate the most powerful ministers in his nation. Guo Wei decided to rebel. As Guo Rong's wife Lady Liu (åæ°) and children including 3 young sons also remained in the capital Bianzhou (æ±´å·; today's Kaifeng, Henan), they were all slaughtered as well. Guo Wei asked Guo Rong to stay behind at the frontier as he led his main army southbound towards Bianzhou.\\n\\nSection::::Career under Emperor Taizu of Later Zhou.\\nIn a few months, Liu Chengyou was killed, Later Han was terminated, as Guo Wei founded the Later Zhou. Guo Rong became the military governor of Zhenning Command (é®å¯§è») and went to Chanzhou (æ¾¶å·; today's Qingfeng County, Henan). At Chanzhou, he quickly eradicated militarized outlaws in the region and promoted literati to enforce laws more effectively, winning the support of the people. He also initiated projects to tear down dilapidated street walls and build new public office buildings and residential housings.\\n\\nChancellor Wang Jun, the most powerful minister, did not see eye-to-eye with Guo Rong on some issues and prevented him from visiting the capital on more than one occasion. In 952, Guo Rong requested permission to lead an army to quell a rebellion, but Wang Jun vetoed it for fear that Guo Rong would hold too much military power. At the end, Guo Wei had to personally lead the troops as an emperor. It was not until Wang's banishment in early 953 that Guo Rong finally got a chance to come back to the capital, when in April 953 he was named Prince of Jin (æç). By this time he was again married, to a Lady Fu, a widowed daughter of general Fu Yanqing. His son Chai Zongxun was born in late 953 in Chanzhou.\\n\\nSection::::Emperor of Later Zhou.\\nGuo Rong (posthumously known as Shizong of Later Zhou) became emperor in 954 upon his adoptive fatherâs death. Like his father, he was considered an able ruler. He continued reforms introduced by his father. More importantly, he began putting pressure on the Northern Han and even the Liao Dynasty, though nothing substantial came of it. More success was met in the south as some minor successes were made against the Southern Tang and Later Shu, paving the way to eventual unification by the Song Dynasty.\\n\\nSection::::Campaign against Liu Chong.\\nOne month after Chai Rong took the throne, Liu Chong, Emperor of Northern Han, colluded with Liao Dynasty to launch an assault on Later Zhou. Against the advice of Minister Feng Dao, Chai Rong decided to lead the army to fight against the incursion. When Chai Rong engaged Liu Chong at Gao Ping (in modern Jincheng), two of Chai's general Fan Aineng, He Hui fled from battlefield along with their troops. At this critical moment, Chai Rong risked his life to break through the defense and crushed Liuâs forces. After this campaign, Chai Rong consolidated his power.\\n\\nHe suffered an early death at the age of 38 when he died from illness while out on the field in 959. He left behind him a six-year-old heir to succeed him. This led to the fall of the dynasty and the rise of the Song Dynasty, which eventually succeeded in reunifying China.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Chai Rong', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7685714'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ngE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7686358', 'text': 'The Beat Continues\\n\\n\"The Beat Continues\" is the big band Entre\\'act overture from the musical \"Over Here!\", which opened on Broadway at the Shubert Theatre (Broadway) on March 6, 1974.

Baseball NT was formed in 1968 under its original name, the Northern Territory Baseball League. Baseball NT is governed nationally by the Australian Baseball Federation. Historically, baseball in Australia and the Northern Territory has been an amateur sport.\\n\\nSection::::Overview.\\nOrganised baseball is played in Darwin, Alice Springs and Katherine. Darwin has four clubs; Nightcliff Tigers, Palmerston Reds, Pints and Tracy Village Rebels. The East Darwin Beasts disbanded in 1987 and the South Darwin Rabbitohs disbanded in 2004. In Darwin, baseball is a dry-season sport, played between April and September each year. Baseball in Darwin is controlled by the Darwin Baseball Association.\\n\\nThe Katherine Baseball Association has four teams; Dodgers, Cubs, Angels and Braves. The sport is usually played between the months of February through to September, during the dry season. Predominantly, only under seventeen competitions are played due to a lack of interested players. Although a high percentage of participating players are successful in making local squads and Territory/ state teams.\\n\\nAlice Springs has six teams; Bulls, Cubs, Demons, Panthers, Redbacks and Venom. In Alice Springs, baseball is a summer sport, usually played between October and March. Baseball in Alice Springs is controlled by the Alice Springs Baseball Association.\\n\\nThe Northern Territory competed in the national Claxton Shield competition between 1981 and 1989. During its nine-year admittance, the Northern Territory won only one game, in 1987, against South Australia with a score of 20-11. Bill Hutcheson, a Catcher, from originally Tennant Creek and later Darwin, was the only player to play in all nine Claxton Shields. He was also the first Territorian to hit a home run in 1984, against Victoria.\\n\\nIn 1991, the Territory joined the national Australian Provincial Championship (also known as the Commonwealth Cup) competition for regional Australian baseball. Bill Fryar became the first Territorian to hit a home run in 1992, against Queensland. In 1999, the Northern Territory won the Cup for the first time under the leadership of player/coach, Andrew Kendray.\\n\\nSuccess for the Northern Territory is difficult as promising juniors are attracted away from the Territory to pursue careers in the southern leagues where their development and opportunities are greater. Several Territorian home-grown players have gone onto successful baseball careers and these most notably include Greg Mosel, Max Hardy, Jon Mellor, Lachlan Burrows, Darren Welch, Wilson Lee, Sam Tibbits, Dushan Ruzic and Adrian Burnside. Rarely do these players return to the Northern Territory. This has created a catch 22 situation for Baseball NT whereby it understands that by developing home-grown talent, there is a good possibility these players will be lost to southern leagues, unlikely to return to the Northern Territory. \\n\\nIn November 1983 however, Territory players were selected to play for Australia against the touring Japanese Industrial League champions, Toshiba, and included, Bill Fryar and Laurie Moore from Darwin; John Baldock from Tennant Creek and Darren Welch from Alice Springs.\\n\\nSince the late 1990s, the popularity and standard of baseball in the Northern Territory has steadily declined as it struggles to compete against Australian icon sports such as cricket, as well as attract juniors away from the information technology revolution such as computer games and the \"hip-hop\" culture.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Baseball NT', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7692683'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'pQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7692961', 'text': 'Nazareth Baptist Church\\n\\nThe Nazareth Baptist Church (Alternatively called \"The Nazarite Church\" \"iBandla lamaNazaretha\") is the second largest, (first and largest being Zion Christian Church with a membership of between 8 to 10 million), African initiated church founded by Isaiah Shembe in 1910.\\n\\nIt has approximately 3.2 million members.

She is known for her role as receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the CBS sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" (1978â1982), which earned her three Golden Globe Award and two Emmy Award nominations.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nAnderson was born in Saint Paul, Minnesota, the daughter of Maxine Hazel (nÃ©e Kallin; 1924â1985), a model, and Klaydon Carl \"Andy\" Anderson (1922â1977), an environmental chemist. She grew up in suburban Roseville, Minnesota. As a senior at Alexander Ramsey Senior High School in Roseville, she was voted Valentine Queen of the Valentine\\'s Day Winter Formal of 1963. She attended the University of Minnesota. As she says in her autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels\", her father was originally going to name her \"Leiloni\" but then realized to his horror that when she got to her teen years it was likely to be twisted into \"Lay Loni\". So it was changed to simply \"Loni\".\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nHer acting debut came with a bit part in the film \"Nevada Smith\" (1966), starring Steve McQueen. After that, she went virtually unemployed as an actress for nearly a decade, before she finally began achieving guest roles on episodic television series in the mid-1970s. She appeared in two episodes of \"S.W.A.T.\", and later appeared on the sitcom \"Phyllis\", as well as the detective series \"Police Woman\" and \"Harry O\". In 1978, she guest-starred as Susan Walters on a season two episode of the popular sitcom \"Three\\'s Company\", after auditioning well but not winning the role of Chrissy at the start of the series. Her appearance on the show brought her to the attention of the ABC network.\\n\\nAnderson\\'s most famous acting role came as the sultry receptionist Jennifer Marlowe on the sitcom \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" (1978â1982). She was offered the role when producers saw the poster of her in a red swimsuitâa pose similar to Farrah Fawcett\\'s famous 1976 pin-up. The sitcom\\'s creator, Hugh Wilson, later admitted Anderson got the role because her body resembled Jayne Mansfield and because she possessed the innocent sexuality of Marilyn Monroe.\\n\\nAlthough the series suffered in the Nielsen ratings throughout the majority of its four-year run, it had a strong and loyal following among teenagers, young adults and disc jockeys. Owing to her rising popularity as the series\\' so-called \"main attraction\", Anderson walked out on the sitcom during the 1980 summer hiatus, requesting a substantial salary increase. During her hiatus, while she was renegotiating her contract, she starred as blonde bombshell Jayne Mansfield in the CBS made-for-television film \"The Jayne Mansfield Story\" (1980). After the network agreed to her requests, Anderson returned to the series and remained with it until its cancellation in 1982. The series has since remained popular in syndication around the world.\\n\\nAside from her acting career, Anderson has become known for her colorful personal life, particularly her relationship and marriage to actor Burt Reynolds.\\nThey starred in the comedy film \"Stroker Ace\" (1983), which was a critical and box office failure. She later appeared as herself in the romantic comedy \"The Lonely Guy\" (1984), starring Steve Martin. She voiced Flo, a collie in the animated classic film \"All Dogs Go to Heaven\" (1989).\\nIn the mid-to-late 1980s, Anderson\\'s acting career gradually declined. She was teamed with \"Wonder Woman\" actress Lynda Carter in the television series, \"Partners in Crime\" in 1984. She appeared in television adaptations of classic Hollywood films, such as \"A Letter to Three Wives\" (1985) with Michele Lee, and \"Sorry, Wrong Number\" (1989) with Patrick Macnee and Hal Holbrook, both of which received little attention. After starring in \"Coins in the Fountain\" (1990), Anderson received considerable praise for her portrayal of comedian actress Thelma Todd in the television movie \"\" (1991). In the early 1990s, she attempted to co-star with her husband Burt Reynolds on his new CBS sitcom \"Evening Shade\", but the network was not fond of the idea, thus replacing Anderson with Marilu Henner. After Delta Burke was fired from the CBS sitcom \"Designing Women\" in 1991, producers offered Anderson a role as Burke\\'s replacement, which never came to pass because the network refused to pay Anderson the salary she had requested. She agreed to return as Jennifer Marlowe on two episodes of \"The New WKRP in Cincinnati\", a sequel to the original series. In 1993, Anderson was added to the third season of the NBC sitcom \"Nurses\", playing hospital administrator Casey MacAffee. Although her entering the series was an attempt to boost the series\\' ratings, the series was canceled shortly thereafter. Anderson has since returned to guest-starring on several popular television series, such as playing the \"witch-trash\" cousin on \"Sabrina the Teenage Witch\" and as Vallery Irons\\' mother on \"V.I.P.\" She also starred in the comedy film \"A Night at the Roxbury\" (1998).\\n\\nIn April 2018, Anderson was seen promoting the \"WKRP in Cincinnati\" television series and other classic television series on the MeTV television network.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nAnderson has been married four times; her first three marriages were to: Bruce Hasselberg (1964â1966), Ross Bickell (1973â1981), and actor (and \"Stroker Ace\" (1983) co-star) Burt Reynolds (1988â1993). On May 17, 2008, Anderson married musician Bob Flick, one of the founding members of the folk band The Brothers Four. The couple had first met at a movie premiere in Minneapolis in 1963.\\n\\nAnderson has two children: a daughter, Deidre Hoffman (fathered by Hasselberg), who was a school administrator in California; and a son, Quinton Anderson Reynolds (born August 31, 1988), whom she and Reynolds adopted. She also has a sister named Andrea Sams. Anderson\\'s autobiography, \"My Life in High Heels\", was published in 1997.\\n\\nGrowing up with parents of the World War II generation, who both smoked, Anderson witnessed the effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), a lung disease often caused by smoking. In 1999, she became a spokesperson about COPD.

Trawling is a method of fishing that involves actively dragging or pulling a trawl through the water behind one or more trawlers. Trawls are fishing nets that are pulled along the bottom of the sea or in midwater at a specified depth. A trawler may also operate two or more trawl nets simultaneously (double-rig and multi-rig).\\n\\nThere are many variants of trawling gear. They vary according to local traditions, bottom conditions, and how large and powerful the trawling boats are. A trawling boat can be a small open boat with only 30\\xa0horsepower or a large factory ship with 10,000\\xa0horsepower. Trawl variants include beam trawls, large-opening midwater trawls, and large bottom trawls, such as \"rock hoppers\" that are rigged with heavy rubber wheels that let the net crawl over rocky bottom.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nDuring the 17th century, the British developed the Dogger, an early type of sailing trawler commonly operated in the North Sea. The Dogger takes its name from the Dutch word \"dogger\", meaning a fishing vessel which tows a trawl. Doggers were slow but sturdy, capable of fishing in the rough conditions of the North Sea.\\n\\nThe modern fishing trawler was developed in the 19th century, at the English fishing port of Brixham. By the early 19th century, the fishermen at Brixham needed to expand their fishing area further than ever before due to the ongoing depletion of stocks that was occurring in the overfished waters of South Devon. The Brixham trawler that evolved there was of a sleek build and had a tall gaff rig, which gave the vessel sufficient speed to make long distance trips out to the fishing grounds in the ocean. They were also sufficiently robust to be able to tow large trawls in deep water. The great trawling fleet that built up at Brixham, earned the village the title of \\'Mother of Deep-Sea Fisheries\\'.\\n\\nThis revolutionary design made large scale trawling in the ocean possible for the first time, resulting in a massive migration of fishermen from the ports in the South of England, to villages further north, such as Scarborough, Hull, Grimsby, Harwich and Yarmouth, that were points of access to the large fishing grounds in the Atlantic Ocean. The small village of Grimsby grew to become the \\'largest fishing port in the world\\' by the mid 19th century. With the tremendous expansion in the fishing industry, the Grimsby Dock Company was opened in 1854 as the first modern fishing port. The facilities incorporated many innovations of the time â the dock gates and cranes were operated by hydraulic power, and the Grimsby Dock Tower was built to provide a head of water with sufficient pressure by William Armstrong.\\n\\nThe elegant Brixham trawler spread across the world, influencing fishing fleets everywhere. By the end of the 19th century, there were over 3,000 fishing trawlers in commission in Britain, with almost 1,000 at Grimsby. These trawlers were sold to fishermen around Europe, including from the Netherlands and Scandinavia. Twelve trawlers went on to form the nucleus of the German fishing fleet.\\n\\nSection::::Advent of steam power.\\nThe earliest steam powered fishing boats first appeared in the 1870s and used the trawl system of fishing as well as lines and drift nets. These were large boats, usually in length with a beam of around . They weighed 40â50 tons and travelled at .\\n\\nThe earliest purpose built fishing vessels were designed and made by David Allan in Leith in March 1875, when he converted a drifter to steam power. In 1877, he built the first screw propelled steam trawler in the world. This vessel was \"Pioneer LH854\". She was of wooden construction with two masts and carried a gaff rigged main and mizen using booms, and a single foresail. Allan argued that his motivation for steam power was to increase the safety of fishermen. However local fishermen saw power trawling as a threat. Allan built a total of ten boats at Leith between 1877 and 1881. Twenty-one boats were completed at Granton, his last vessel being \"Degrave\" in 1886. Most of these were sold to foreign owners in France, Belgium, Spain and the West Indies.\\n\\nThe first steam boats were made of wood, but steel hulls were soon introduced and were divided into watertight compartments. They were well designed for the crew with a large building that contained the wheelhouse and the deckhouse. The boats built in the 20th century only had a mizzen sail, which was used to help steady the boat when its nets were out. The main function of the mast was now as a crane for lifting the catch ashore. It also had a steam capstan on the foredeck near the mast for hauling nets. These boats had a crew of twelve made up of a skipper, driver, fireman (to look after the boiler) and nine deck hands.\\n\\nSteam fishing boats had many advantages. They were usually about than the sailing vessels so they could carry more nets and catch more fish. This was important, as the market was growing quickly at the beginning of the 20th century. They could travel faster and further and with greater freedom from weather, wind and tide. Because less time was spent travelling to and from the fishing grounds, more time could be spent fishing. The steam boats also gained the highest prices for their fish, as they could return quickly to harbour with their fresh catch.\\n\\nSteam trawlers were introduced at Grimsby and Hull in the 1880s. In 1890 it was estimated that there were 20,000 men on the North Sea. The steam drifter was not used in the herring fishery until 1897. The last sailing fishing trawler was built in 1925 in Grimsby.\\n\\nSection::::Further development.\\nTrawler designs adapted as the way they were powered changed from sail to coal-fired steam by World War I to diesel and turbines by the end of World War II.\\n\\nThe first trawlers fished over the side, rather than over the stern. In 1947, the company Christian Salvesen, based in Leith, Scotland, refitted a surplus \"Algerine\"-class minesweeper (HMS \"Felicity\") with refrigeration equipment and a factory ship stern ramp, to produce the first combined freezer/stern trawler in 1947.\\n\\nThe first purpose built stern trawler was \"Fairtry\" built in 1953 at Aberdeen. The ship was much larger than any other trawlers then in operation and inaugurated the era of the \\'super trawler\\'. As the ship pulled its nets over the stern, it could lift out a much greater haul of up to 60 tons. \"Lord Nelson\" followed in 1961, installed with vertical plate freezers that had been researched and built at the Torry Research Station. These ships served as a basis for the expansion of \\'super trawlers\\' around the world in the following decades.\\n\\nSince World War II, commercial fishing vessels have been increasingly equipped with electronic aids, such as radio navigation aids and fish finders. During the Cold War, some countries fitted fishing trawlers with additional electronic gear so they could be used as spy ships to monitor the activities of other countries.\\n\\nSection::::Modern trawlers.\\nModern trawlers are usually decked vessels designed for robustness. Their superstructure (wheelhouse and accommodation) can be forward, midship or aft. Motorised winches, electronic navigation and sonar systems are usually installed. Fishing equipment varies in sophistication depending on the size of the vessel and the technology used. Design features for modern fishing trawlers vary substantially, as many national maritime jurisdictions do not impose compulsory vessel inspection standards for smaller commercial fishing vessels.\\n\\nSection::::Mechanised hauling.\\nMechanised hauling devices are used on modern trawlers. Trawl winches, such as Gilson winches, net drums and other auxiliary winches are installed on deck to control the towing warps (trawling wires) and store them when not in use.\\n\\nSection::::Electronics.\\nModern trawlers make extensive use of contemporary electronics, including navigation and communication equipment, fish detection devices, and equipment to control and monitor gear. Just which equipment will be installed depends on the size and type of the trawler.\\n\\nMuch of this equipment can be controlled from the wheelhouse or bridge. Smaller trawlers have wheelhouses, where electronic equipment for navigation, communications, fish detection and trawl sensors are typically arranged about the skipper\\'s chair. Larger vessels have a bridge, with a command console at the centre and a further co-pilot chair. Modern consoles display all the key information on an integrated display. Less frequently used sensors and monitors may be mounted on the deckhead.\\n\\nNavigational instruments, such as an autopilot and GPS, are used for manoeuvering the vessel in harbour and at sea. Radar can be used, for example, when pair trawling to keep the correct distance between the two vessels. Communication instruments range from basic radio devices to maritime distress systems and EPIRBs, as well as devices for communicating with the crew. Fish detection devices, such as echosounders and sonar, are used to locate fish.\\nDuring trawling operations, a range of trawl sensors may be used to assist with controlling and monitoring gear. These are often referred to as \"trawl monitoring systems\" or \"net mensuration systems\".\\n\\nSection::::Fish storage and processing.\\nModern trawlers store the fish they catch in some form of chilled condition. At the least, the fish will be stored in boxes covered with ice or stored with ice in the fish hold. In general, the fish are kept fresh by chilling them with ice or refrigerated sea water, or freezing them in blocks. Also, many trawlers carry out some measure of onboard fish processing, and the larger the vessel, the more likely it is to include fish processing facilities. For example, the catch can undergo some preliminary processing by being passed through sorting and washing devices. At a further stage, the fish might be mechanically gutted and filleted. Factory trawlers may process fish oil and fish meal and may include canning plants.\\nSection::::Other design features.\\nCrew quarters are usually below the wheelhouse and may include bunks, with cot sides to stop the occupant from rolling out in heavy weather. The need for drying sea clothes is shown by a notice in at least one steam trawler\\'s boiler room saying \"\"Do not dry oil frocks over the boiler\"\".\\nSection::::Trawler types.\\nTrawlers can be classified by their architecture, the type of fish they catch, the fishing method used, or geographical origin. The classification used below follows the FAO, who classify trawlers by the gear they use.\\n\\nSection::::Outrigger trawlers.\\nOutrigger trawlers use outriggers, or booms, to tow the trawl. These outriggers are usually fastened to, or at the foot of the mast and extend out over the sides of the vessel during fishing operations. Each side can deploy a twin trawl or a single otter trawl. Outrigger trawlers may have the superstructure forward or aft. Warp winches with capstans are installed on the deck to haul the catch.\\n\\nOutrigger trawlers use vertical fish finders of different kinds, according to their size. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Beam trawlers.\\nBeam trawlers are a type of outrigger trawler (above), with the superstructure aft and the working deck amidships. They use a very strong outrigger boom on each side, each towing a beam trawl, with the warps going through blocks at the end of the boom. This arrangement makes it easier to stow and handle the large beams. The outriggers are controlled from a midship A-frame or mast. The towing winch is forward of the superstructure, with the towing warps passed through deck bollards and then out to the towing blocks on the booms.\\n\\nBeam trawling is used in the flatfish fisheries in the North Sea. They are equipped with equipment for hauling the net and stowing it aboard. Typically an echosounder and sonar is used for finding fish.\\n\\nThey are medium-sized and high powered vessels, towing gear at speeds up to 8 knots. To avoid the boat capsizing if the trawl snags on the sea floor, winch brakes can be installed, along with safety release systems in the boom stays. The engine power of bottom trawlers is restricted to 2000 HP (1472 KW) for further safety. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Otter trawlers.\\nOtter trawlers deploy one or more parallel trawls kept apart horizontally using otter boards. These trawls can be towed in midwater or along the bottom. Otter trawlers range in size from sailing canoes to supertrawlers.\\n\\nOtter trawlers usually have two gallows at the stern with towing blocks. The towing warps run through these, each regulated by its own winch. Medium and large trawlers usually have a stern ramp for hauling the trawl onto the deck. Some trawlers tow twin parallel trawls, using three warps, each warp with its own winch. Some otter trawlers are also outrigger trawlers (above), using outriggers to tow one or two otter trawls from each side.\\n\\nUsually otter trawlers have the superstructure forward, though it can be aft or amidship. Gallows are on the stern quarters or there is a stern gantry for operating the otter boards. Pelagic trawlers can use fish pumps to empty the cod end.\\n\\nSection::::Pair trawlers.\\nPair trawlers are trawlers which operate together towing a single trawl. They keep the trawl open horizontally by keeping their distance when towing. Otter boards are not used. Pair trawlers operate both midwater and bottom trawls.\\n\\nThe superstructure is forward or midships and the working deck aft. Pelagic trawlers can have fish pumps to empty the codend.\\n\\nSection::::Side trawlers.\\nSide trawlers have the trawl deployed over the side with the trawl warps passing through blocks suspended from a forward gallow and another aft gallow. Usually the superstructure is towards the stern, the fish hold amidships, and the transversal trawl winch forward of the superstructure. A derrick may be a boom rigged to the foremast to help shoot the codend from the side. Until the late sixties, side trawlers were the most common deep sea boat used in North Atlantic fisheries. The 1950s side trawler, \"Ross Tiger\" is preserved in Grimsby. These trawlers were used for a longer period than other kinds of trawlers, but are now being replaced by stern trawlers. Some side trawlers still in use have been equipped with net drums. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Stern trawlers.\\nStern trawlers have trawls which are deployed and retrieved from the stern. Larger stern trawlers often have a ramp, though pelagic and small stern trawlers are often designed without a ramp. Stern trawlers are designed to operate in most weather conditions. They can work alone when midwater or bottom trawling, or two can work together as pair trawlers. The superstructure is forward with an aft working deck. At the stern are gallows or a gantry for operating otter boards. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nAny fish processing usually occurs in deck houses or below deck. A wet fish stern trawler stores the fish in ice or sea water which has been refrigerated. A freezer stern trawler stores the fish in frozen boxes or blocks, and a factory stern trawler processes the catch. A pelagic stern trawler may use fish pumps to empty the codend.\\n\\nSection::::Freezer trawlers.\\nThe majority of trawlers operating on the high seas are freezer trawlers. They have facilities for preserving fish by freezing, allowing them to remain at sea for extended periods of time. They are medium to large size trawlers, with the same general arrangement as stern or side trawlers. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Wet fish trawlers.\\nWet fish trawlers are trawlers where the fish is kept in the hold in a fresh/wet condition, in boxes covered with ice or with ice in the fish hold. They must operate in areas close to their landing place, and the time such a vessel can spend fishing is limited. Drawing (FAO)\\n\\nSection::::Trawler/purse seiners.\\nTrawler/purse seiners are designed so the deck equipment, including an appropriate combination winch, can be rearranged and used for both methods. Blocks, purse davits, trawl gallows and rollers need to be arranged so they control the pursing lines and warp leads and in such a way as to reduce the time required to convert from one arrangement to the other. These vessels are usually classified as trawlers, since the power requirement for trawling is higher.\\n\\nSection::::Naval trawlers.\\nDuring both World Wars some countries created small warships by converting and arming existing trawlers or building new vessels to standard trawler designs. They were typically armed with a small naval gun and sometimes depth charges, and were used for patrolling, escorting other vessels and minesweeping.\\n\\nSection::::Safety.\\nOccupational safety is a concern on fishing trawlers. For example, a United States cooperative which operates a fleet of 24 bottom trawlers in Alaskan water reported 25 fatalities over the period 2001â2012. The risk of a fatal injury was 41 times higher than the average for workers in the United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Fishing trawler', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=769874'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7699478', 'text': 'Revilo\\n\\nRevilo (\"Oliver\" spelt backwards) is\\n\\n', 'title': 'Revilo', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7699478'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7701614', 'text': \"Mackenzie River, Queensland\\n\\nMackenzie River is a locality in the Isaac Region, Queensland, Australia.

Baetica was bordered to the west by Lusitania, and to the northeast by Hispania Tarraconensis. Baetica remained one of the basic divisions of Hispania under the Visigoths down to 711. Baetica () was part of Al-Andalus under the Moors in the 8th century and approximately corresponds to modern Andalusia. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nBefore Romanization, the mountainous area that was to become Baetica was occupied by several settled Iberian tribal groups. Celtic influence was not as strong as it was in the Celtiberian north. According to the geographer Claudius Ptolemy, the indigenes were the powerful Turdetani, in the valley of the Guadalquivir in the west, bordering on Lusitania, and the partly Hellenized Turduli with their city Baelo, in the hinterland behind the coastal Phoenician trading colonies, whose Punic inhabitants Ptolemy termed the \"Bastuli\". Phoenician Gadira (Cadiz) was on an island against the coast of Hispania Baetica. Other important Iberians were the Bastetani, who occupied the AlmerÃ­a and mountainous Granada regions. Towards the southeast, Punic influence spread from the Carthaginian cities on the coast: New Carthage (Roman \"Cartago Nova,\" modern Cartagena), Abdera and Malaca (MÃ¡laga).\\n\\nSome of the Iberian cities retained their pre-Indo-European names in Baetica throughout the Roman era. Granada was called \"Eliberri\", \"Illiberis\" and \"Illiber\" by the Romans; in Basque, \"\"iri-berri\"\" or \"\"ili-berri\"\", still signifies \"new town\".\\n\\nThe south of the Iberian peninsula was agriculturally rich, providing for export of wine, olive oil and the fermented fish sauce called \"garum\" that were staples of the Mediterranean diet, and its products formed part of the western Mediterranean trade economy even before it submitted to Rome in 206 BC. After the defeat of Carthage in the Second Punic War, which found its \"casus belli\" on the coast of Baetica at Saguntum, Hispania was significantly Romanized in the course of the 2nd century BC, following the uprising initiated by the Turdetani in 197. The central and north-eastern Celtiberians soon followed suit. It took Cato the Elder, who became consul in 195 BC and was given the command of the whole peninsula to put down the rebellion in the northeast and the lower Ebro valley. He then marched southwards and put down a revolt by the Turdetani. Cato returned to Rome in 194, leaving two praetors in charge of the two Iberian provinces. In the late Roman Republic, Hispania remained divided like Gaul into a \"Nearer\" and a \"Farther\" province, as experienced marching overland from Gaul: \"Hispania Citerior\" (the Ebro region), and \"Ulterior\" (the Guadalquivir region). The battles in Hispania during the 1st century BC were largely confined to the north.\\n\\nIn the reorganization of the Empire in 14 BC, when Hispania was remade into the three Imperial provinces, Baetica was governed by a proconsul who had formerly been a praetor. Fortune smiled on rich Baetica, which was \"Baetica Felix,\" and a dynamic, upwardly-mobile social and economic middling stratum developed there, which absorbed freed slaves and far outnumbered the rich elite. The Senatorial province of Baetica became so secure that no Roman legion was required to be permanently stationed there. \"Legio VII Gemina\" was permanently stationed to the north, in Hispania Tarraconensis.\\nHispania Baetica was divided into four \"conventÅ«s\", which were territorial divisions like judicial circuits, where the chief men met together at major centers, at fixed times of year, under the eye of the proconsul, to oversee the administration of justice: the \"conventus Gaditanus\" (of Gades, or CÃ¡diz), \"Cordubensis\" (of Cordoba), \"Astigitanus\" (of Astigi, or Ãcija), and \"Hispalensis\" (of Hispalis, or Seville). As the towns became the permanent seats of standing courts during the later Empire, the \"conventÅ«s\" were superseded (Justinian\\'s Code, i.40.6) and the term \"conventus\" is lastly applied to certain bodies of Roman citizens living in a province, forming a sort of enfranchised corporation, and representing the Roman people in their district as a kind of gentry; and it was from among these that proconsuls generally took their assistants. So in spite of some social upsets, as when Septimius Severus put to death a number of leading Baetiansâ including women â the elite in Baetica remained a stable class for centuries.\\n\\nColumella, who wrote a twelve volume treatise on all aspects of Roman farming and knew viticulture, came from Baetica. The vast olive plantations of Baetica shipped olive oil from the coastal ports by sea to supply Roman legions in Germania. Amphoras from Baetica have been found everywhere in the Western Roman empire. It was to keep Roman legions supplied by sea routes that the Empire needed to control the distant coasts of Lusitania and the northern Atlantic coast of Hispania.\\n\\nBaetica was rich and utterly Romanized, facts that the Emperor Vespasian was rewarding when he granted the \"Ius latii\" that extended the rights pertaining to Roman citizenship (\"latinitas\") to the inhabitants of Hispania, an honor that secured the loyalty of the Baetian elite and its middle class. The Roman Emperor Trajan, the first emperor of provincial birth, came from Baetica, though of Italian stock, and his kinsman and successor Hadrian came from a family residing in Baetica, though Hadrian himself was born at Rome (which some say he made up). Baetia was Roman until the brief invasion of the Vandals and Alans passed through in the 5th century, followed by the more permanent kingdom of the Visigoths. The province formed part of the Exarchate of Africa and was joined to Mauretania Tingitana after Belisarius\\' reconquest of Africa. The Catholic bishops of Baetica, solidly backed by their local population, were able to convert the Arian Visigoth king Reccared and his nobles. In the 8th century the Islamic Berbers (\"Moors\") of North Africa established the Caliphate of Cordoba, conquering Baetica. The region was known to them as \"al-Andalus\".\\n\\nThe early 20th-century composer Manuel de Falla wrote a \"FantasÃ­a BÃ©tica\" for piano, using Andalusian melodies.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hispania Baetica', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770608', 'cat_id': '770608', 'cat_title': 'Motorsport_in_Daytona_Beach,_Florida', 'cat_pages': '13', 'cat_subcats': '2', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '770736', 'text': 'Kristijonas Donelaitis\\n\\nKristijonas Donelaitis (; 1 January 1714 â 18 February 1780) was a Prussian Lithuanian poet and Lutheran pastor. He lived and worked in Lithuania Minor, a territory in the Kingdom of Prussia, that had a sizable Lithuanian-speaking minority. He wrote the first classic Lithuanian language poem, \"The Seasons\" (), which became one of the principal works of Lithuanian poetry. The poem, a classic work of Lithuanian literature, depicts everyday life of Lithuanian peasants, their struggle with serfdom, and the annual cycle of life.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nDonelaitis was born at Lasdinehlen estate near Gumbinnen, East Prussia. His parents were free peasants who owned the land that they cultivated. His father died in 1720, leaving seven children (four sons and three daughters). One of his three brothers, Friedrich, became a goldsmith in KÃ¶nigsberg. Another brother, Michael, inherited the father\\'s farm. His third brother, Adam, became a blacksmith and innkeeper.\\n\\nIn 1731, Donelaitis began attending the cathedral school in Kneiphof, a section of KÃ¶nigsberg. He lived in a pauper\\'s dormitory and often went hungry for days. After graduation, he received a scholarship in 1736 to study at the University of KÃ¶nigsberg. For four years he studied Lutheran theology. His world view was shaped by the classical curriculum, required Lithuanian studies, and the Pietism movement. He learned Greek, Latin, French, and Hebrew languages, and studied the writings of classical authors such as Homer, Hesiod, Horace, and Virgil. After graduation, he was appointed as a cantor in StallupÃ¶nen. After the school rector died, Donelaitis took over his position. In 1743, he passed the required examination to become a pastor in Tollmingkehmen.\\n\\nSection::::Life in Tollmingkehmen.\\nDonelaitis lived in Tollmingkehmen from 1743 until his death in 1780. At the time, the parish of Tollmingkehmen had around 30 villages with around 3,000 residents. The population was about two-thirds German and one-third Lithuanian. In 1744, Donelaitis married Anna Regina Ohlefant, widow of the school rector in StallupÃ¶nen. In 1747, he worked to restore the rectory, and built a new brick church in 1756. In 1757, during the Seven Years\\' War, Donelaitis and his parishioners retreated to the Romincka Forest to hide from the advancing Imperial Russian Army. When he returned to the town, Donelaitis refused to preach praises to the Russian Tsar. After the war he rebuilt a burned school and sponsored construction of a shelter to widows. His hobbies included building thermometers and barometers, and constructing pianos and clavichords. He died, aged 66, in Tollmingkehmen, East Prussia.\\n\\nSection::::Works.\\nNone of Donelaitis\\'s works were published during his lifetime. Donelaitis wrote at least three poems in the German language (\"An der Amstrath Donalitius nach dem Verlust seiner Gattin\", \"Der Gott der Finsterniss\", and \"Unschuld sei mein ganzes Leben\"). His Lithuanian works consist of six fables and the poem \"The Seasons\". Donelaitis\\'s publisher, Ludwig Rhesa, believed that the fables, based on Aesop\\'s Fables, were written for his students in StallupÃ¶nen. Their language and poetic rhythm are not as well-developed as in his later works.\\n\\nHis major work, \"The Seasons\", was titled by Rheza. It consisted of four idylls, totaling 2,997 hexameters. The work was a long-term project, often revised and rewritten, without a clear beginning or ending. Only two original idylls survive. The other two were destroyed during the Napoleonic Wars. The full work is known from a copy made by Pastor Hohlfeldt after 1794. Between 1809 and 1818, Rheza collected Donelaitis\\'s works, edited and translated them, and finally published it as \"Das jahr in vier GesÃ¤ngen\". It was a heavily edited and censored edition, containing only about one sixth of the original poem. In 1824, Rheza also published the fables. A fuller publication of \"The Seasons\" was prepared by August Schleicher in 1865, but this edition was criticized by Georg H. F. Nesselmann, who prepared an edition in 1869.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nDonelaitis and his works are considered to be an important part of Lithuanian culture, which also led to creation of literature and music works based on Donelaitis\\'s life and his poem \"The Seasons\". In Lithuanian National Opera and Ballet Theatre in 1985, an opera \"Kristijonas\" by Algimantas BraÅ¾inskas was performed. In 2012, an oratorio \"Seasons\" by Bronius KutaviÄius was performed.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kristijonas Donelaitis', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=770736', 'cat_id': '770736', 'cat_title': \"USC_Trojans_men's_volleyball_players\", 'cat_pages': '9', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7710191', 'text': 'French ship Droits de l\\'Homme (1794)\\n\\nDroits de l\\'Homme () was a 74-gun ship of the line of the French Navy during the French Revolutionary Wars.

After unsuccessful attempts to land troops on Ireland, the \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" headed back to her home port of Brest with the soldiers still on board. Two British frigates were waiting to intercept stragglers from the fleet, and engaged \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" in the Action of 13 January 1797. Heavily damaged by the British ships and unable to manoeuvre in rough seas, the ship struck a sandbar and was wrecked. Hundreds of lives were lost in the disaster.\\n\\nSection::::Construction and naming.\\nThe ship was built at Port-LibertÃ© (now Lorient) and launched on \"10 Prairial de l\\'An II\" (29 May 1794).

On their way, the fleet was dispersed by tempests. The \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" arrived at Bantry Bay and cruised off the coast, capturing the brigs \"Cumberland\" and \"Calypso\". She stayed there for eight days to ascertain that no French ship was in distress on the coast, and departed for Brittany.\\nOn \"25 NivÃ´se An V\" in the Action of 13 January 1797, off Penmarch, \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" met the British frigates (44), under Sir Edward Pellew, and (36), commanded by Robert C. Reynolds. The sea was rough, preventing \"Droits de l\\'Homme\" from using her lower deck batteries and from boarding the British. Lacrosse was wounded; he gave command of the ship to his second officer, PrÃ©vost de Lacroix, and had his crew swear not to strike their colours.\\n\\nAfter 13 hours of combat, running out of ammunition, the British broke contact when \"Indefatigable\" sighted land ahead. \"Indefatigable\", despite having damage to her masts and rigging, managed to beat off the lee shore and escape Penmarch reefs; \"Amazon\" ran aground and was destroyed near PlozÃ©vet, and her crew captured. \"Droits de l\\'Homme\", having lost her rudder, masts and anchors, ran aground off PlozÃ©vet.\\n\\nSome of the crew were rescued by the ship\\'s boats and fishing boats from nearby villages, but the rescue was interrupted for five days by the storm; 60 men died for lack of food and water.

All steps along the manufacturing process, and more, must be taken into account in the design of the package for any given product. Package engineering is an interdisciplinary field integrating science, engineering, technology and management to protect and identify products for distribution, storage, sale, and use. It encompasses the process of design, evaluation, and production of packages. It is a system integral to the value chain that impacts product quality, user satisfaction, distribution efficiencies, and safety. includes industry-specific aspects of industrial engineering, marketing, materials science, industrial design and logistics. Packaging engineers must interact with research and development, manufacturing, marketing, graphic design, regulatory, purchasing, planning and so on. The package must sell and protect the product, while maintaining an efficient, cost-effective process cycle.\\n\\nEngineers develop packages from a wide variety of rigid and flexible materials. Some materials have scores or creases to allow controlled folding into package shapes (sometimes resembling origami). Packaging involves extrusion, thermoforming, molding and other processing technologies. Packages are often developed for high speed fabrication, filling, processing, and shipment. Packaging engineers use principles of structural analysis and thermal analysis in their evaluations.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nSome packaging engineers have backgrounds in other science, engineering, or design disciplines while some have college degrees specializing in this field.\\n\\nFormal packaging programs might be listed as package engineering, packaging science, packaging technology, etc. BE, BS, MS, M.Tech and PhD programs are available. Students in a packaging program typically begin with generalized science, business, and engineering classes before progressing into industry-specific topics such as shelf life stability, corrugated box design, cushioning, engineering design, labeling regulations, project management, food safety, robotics, RFID tags, quality management, package testing, packaging machinery, tamper-evident methods, recycling, computer-aided design, etc.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Packaging engineering', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7710805'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'sQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7712095', 'text': 'Information Technology Act, 2000\\n\\nThe Information Technology Act, 2000 (also known as ITA-2000, or the IT Act) is an Act of the Indian Parliament (No 21 of 2000) notified on 17 October 2000. It is the primary law in India dealing with cybercrime and electronic commerce. It is based on the UNCITRAL Model Law on International Commercial Arbitration recommended by the General Assembly of United Nations by a resolution dated 30 January 1997.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nThe bill was passed in the budget session of 2000 and signed by President K. R. Narayanan on 9 May 2000. The bill was finalised by group of officials headed by then Minister of Information Technology Pramod Mahajan.\\n\\nSection::::Summary.\\nThe original Act contained 94 sections, divided into 13 chapters and 4 schedules. The laws apply to the whole of India. Persons of other nationalities can also be indicted under the law, if the crime involves a computer or network located in India.\\n\\nThe Act provides a legal framework for electronic governance by giving recognition to electronic records and digital signatures. It also defines cyber crimes and prescribes penalties for them. The Act directed the formation of a Controller of Certifying Authorities to regulate the issuance of digital signatures. It also established a Cyber Appellate Tribunal to resolve disputes rising from this new law. The Act also amended various sections of the Indian Penal Code, 1860, the Indian Evidence Act, 1872, the Banker\\'s Book Evidence Act, 1891, and the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 to make them compliant with new technologies.\\n\\nSection::::Amendments.\\nA major amendment was made in 2008. It introduced Section 66A which penalized sending of \"offensive messages\". It also introduced Section 69, which gave authorities the power of \"interception or monitoring or decryption of any information through any computer resource\". It also introduced provisions addressing child porn, cyber terrorism and voyeurism. The amendment was passed on 22 December 2008 without any debate in Lok Sabha. The next day it was passed by the Rajya Sabha. It was signed into law by President Pratibha Patil, on 5 February 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Offences.\\nList of offences and the corresponding penalties:\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Criticisms.\\nSection::::Section 66A and restriction of free speech.\\nFrom its establishment as an amendment to the original act in 2008, Section 66A attracted controversy over its unconstitutional nature:\\n\\nIn December 2012, P Rajeev, a Rajya Sabha member from Kerala, tried to pass a resolution seeking to amend the Section 66A. He was supported by D. Bandyopadhyay, Gyan Prakash Pilania, Basavaraj Patil Sedam, Narendra Kumar Kashyap, Rama Chandra Khuntia and Baishnab Charan Parida. P Rajeev pointed that cartoons and editorials allowed in traditional media, were being censored in the new media. He also said that law was barely debated before being passed in December 2008.\\n\\nRajeev Chandrasekhar suggested the 66A should only apply to person to person communication pointing to a similar section under the Indian Post Office Act, 1898. Shantaram Naik opposed any changes, saying that the misuse of law was sufficient to warrant changes. Then Minister for Communications and Information Technology Kapil Sibal defended the existing law, saying that similar laws existed in US and UK. He also said that a similar provision existed under Indian Post Office Act, 1898. However, P Rajeev said that the UK dealt only with communication from person to person.\\n\\nSection::::Petitions challenging constitutionality.\\nIn November 2012, IPS officer Amitabh Thakur and his wife social activist Nutan Thakur, filed a petition in the Lucknow bench of the Allahabad High Court claiming that the Section 66A violated the freedom of speech guaranteed in the Article 19(1)(a) of the Constitution of India. They said that the section was vague and frequently misused.\\n\\nAlso in November 2012, a Delhi-based law student, Shreya Singhal, filed a Public Interest Litigation (PIL) in the Supreme Court of India. She argued that the Section 66A was vaguely phrased, as result it violated Article 14, 19 (1)(a) and Article 21 of the Constitution. The PIL was accepted on 29 November 2012. A similar petition was also filed by the founder of MouthShut.com, Faisal Farooqui, and NGO Common Cause represented by Prashant Bhushan\\nIn August 2014, the Supreme Court asked the central government to respond to petitions filed by Mouthshut.com and later petition filed by the Internet and Mobile Association of India (IAMAI) which claimed that the IT Act gave the government power to arbitrarily remove user-generated content.\\n\\nSection::::Revocation by the Supreme Court.\\nOn 24 March 2015, the Supreme Court of India, gave the verdict that Section 66A is unconstitutional in entirety. The court said that Section 66A of IT Act 2000 is \"arbitrarily, excessively and disproportionately invades the right of free speech\" provided under Article 19(1) of the Constitution of India. But the Court turned down a plea to strike down sections 69A and 79 of the Act, which deal with the procedure and safeguards for blocking certain websites. \\n\\nSection::::Strict data privacy rules.\\nThe data privacy rules introduced in the Act in 2011 have been described as too strict by some Indian and US firms. The rules require firms to obtain written permission from customers before collecting and using their personal data. This has affected US firms which outsource to Indian companies. However, some companies have welcomed the strict rules, saying it will remove fears of outsourcing to Indian companies.\\n\\nSection::::Section 69 and mandatory decryption.\\nThe Section 69 allows intercepting any information and ask for information decryption. To refuse decryption is an offence. The Indian Telegraph Act, 1885 allows the government to tap phones. But, according to a 1996 Supreme Court verdict the government can tap phones only in case of a \"public emergency\". But, there is no such restriction on Section 69. On 20 December 2018, the Ministry of Home Affairs cited Section 69 in the issue of an order authorising ten central agencies to intercept, monitor, and decrypt âany information generated, transmitted, received or stored in any computer.â While some claim this to be a violation of the fundamental right to privacy, the Ministry of Home Affairs has claimed its validity on the grounds of national security. \\n\\nSection::::Future changes.\\nOn 2 April 2015, the Chief Minister of Maharashtra, Devendra Fadnavis revealed to the state assembly that a new law was being framed to replace the repealed Section 66A. Fadnavis was replying to a query Shiv Sena leader Neelam Gorhe. Gorhe had said that repeal of the law would encourage online miscreants and asked whether the state government would frame a law to this regard. Fadnavis said that the previous law had resulted in no convictions, so the law would be framed such that it would be strong and result in convictions.\\n\\nOn 13 April 2015, it announced that the Ministry of Home Affairs would form a committee of officials from the Intelligence Bureau, Central Bureau of Investigation, National Investigation Agency, Delhi Police and ministry itself to produce a new legal framework. This step was reportedly taken after complaints from intelligence agencies that, they were no longer able to counter online posts that involved national security matter or incite people to commit an offence, such as online recruitment for ISIS. Former Minister of State with the Ministry of Information Technology, Milind Deora has supported a new \"unambiguous section to replace 66A\".\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Information Technology Act, 2000', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7712095'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'sgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7715205', 'text': '2005 Azores subtropical storm\\n\\nThe 2005 Azores subtropical storm was the 19th nameable storm and only subtropical storm of the record-breaking 2005 Atlantic hurricane season. It was not officially named by the US National Hurricane Center as it was operationally classified as a non-tropical low. The storm developed in the eastern Atlantic Ocean out of a low-pressure area that gained subtropical characteristics on October\\xa04. The storm was short-lived, crossing over the Azores later on October\\xa04 before becoming extratropical again on October\\xa05. Neither damages nor fatalities were reported during that time. After being absorbed into a cold front, the system went on to become Hurricane Vince, which affected the Iberian Peninsula.\\n\\nMonths after the hurricane season, when the National Hurricane Center was performing its annual review of the season and its named storms, forecasters Jack Beven and Eric Blake identified this previously unnoticed subtropical storm. Despite its unusual location and wide wind field, the system had a well-defined centre convecting around a warm coreâthe hallmark of a subtropical storm.\\n\\nSection::::Meteorological history.\\nThe system originated out of an upper-level low just west of the Canary Islands on September\\xa028. The low organized itself over the next days, producing several bursts of convection. While remaining non-tropical with a cold core it moved gradually west to northwest. On October\\xa03, it became a broad surface low about 400 nautical miles (460\\xa0mi, 740\\xa0km) southwest of SÃ£o Miguel Island in the Azores. Early on October\\xa04, convection increased as the surface low organized itself, and the system became a subtropical depression.\\n\\nAround the same time, the depression turned northeast into a warm sector ahead of an oncoming cold front, and strengthened into a subtropical storm. The system continued to track northeast and strengthened slightly, reaching its peak intensity of 50\\xa0mph (85\\xa0km/h) as it approached the Azores that evening. After tracking through the Azores, the storm weakened slightly as it moved to the north-northeast. Through an interaction with the cold front early on October\\xa05 the subtropical storm became extratropical. The system was fully absorbed by the front later that day. The newly absorbed system would separate from the dissolving frontal system and become Subtropical Storm Vince on October\\xa08.\\n\\nAt the time, the system was not believed to have been subtropical. However, there were several post-season findings that confirmed that the system was indeed a subtropical storm. The first was the cloud pattern, in which it had deep convection around the center and was better organized with a well-defined center of circulation. In addition, the system had a warm core more typical of tropical cyclones as opposed to the cold core of extratropical cyclones. The warm-core nature also meant that there were no warm or cold fronts attached to the system, as temperatures did not change ahead of and behind the system until the unrelated cold front passed the Azores. Satellite imagery suggested that the system was briefly a tropical storm as the warm core was found; however, the widespread wind field and the presence of an upper-level trough confirmed that it was merely subtropical.\\n\\nSection::::Impact, classification, and records.\\nTropical storm-force winds were reported across parts of the Azores, primarily on the eastern islands. The strongest winds were reported on Santa Maria Island, where 10-minute sustained winds reached 49\\xa0mph (79\\xa0km/h) with gusts to 59\\xa0mph (94\\xa0km/h). Ponta Delgada faced 38\\xa0mph (61\\xa0km/h) winds, with the peak recorded gust being 52\\xa0mph (85\\xa0km/h). No damage or fatalities were reported.\\n\\nThe storm was not classified as a subtropical storm until April\\xa010, 2006, after a reassessment by the National Hurricane Center. Every year, the NHC re-analyzes the systems of the past hurricane season and revises the storm history frequently if there is new data that was operationally unavailable. If the storm had been operationally recognized, it would have been named Subtropical Storm Tammy, and storms forming after October\\xa04 would have been moved one name down the list. Hurricane Wilma would have been given the name \"Alpha\": a name that, had it been retired like Wilma was, could not be replaced by an \"alternate\" Greek letter, as is the convention with names on the standard AâW list. When the system strengthened into a subtropical storm on October\\xa04, it was the earliest the 19th tropical or subtropical storm of the season formed. The old record was held by an unnamed storm in the 1933 Atlantic hurricane season, which formed on October\\xa025, 1933. It was also only the fourth time that 19\\xa0storms formed in a season.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': '2005 Azores subtropical storm', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7715205'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'swE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7717712', 'text': 'FranÃ§ois-Romain LhÃ©risson\\n\\nLe grandHaitiFranÃ§ois-Romain LhÃ©risson (1798â1859) was a Haitian poet and educator.

The ninth through sixteenth levels are identical to the first through eighth, except the cars all move faster and the dollar signs (see next paragraph) don\\'t last as long.

Named after the backdraft which occurs in some fire situations, this drink produces a similar condition on purpose using flammable alcoholic drinks and an enclosing container, such as an upside down pint glass. Below is a typical procedure for producing one variation of the Backdraft drink. The combination of warm alcohol, followed by inhaling vaporized alcohol, and then finishing with a highly spiced warm alcohol, makes the drinking of this drink difficult, and while it tends not to have an immediate effect (since it is drunk quickly), the warmth of the alcohol and the vapor, make the concentration and absorption of alcohol into the bloodstream quicker than other drinks, and produces a more profound impact.\\n\\nThe procedure listed below is a typical illustration of how the drink is presented, and the steps used to produce the backdraft effect. The alcohols listed can be substituted with others, as there are various recipes. However, the steps of this procedure are required to be taken in this order to produce what is known as a classic backdraft drink.\\n\\nSection::::Classical Backdraft Preparation.\\nA classic Backdraft is prepared by pouring equal amounts of Drambuie and Grand Marnier into a snifter. The mixture is set alight, and after a few seconds, extinguished by having the imbiber seal the top of the glass with their hand, although often a coaster or saucer is used instead. Once the flame is out, a straw is inserted, keeping as much of the seal intact as possible to contain the vapors.\\n\\nBoth the liquid and the vapors are then consumed through the straw.\\n\\nDrambuie and Grand Marnier will be extremely difficult to ignite, if not impossible, so backdrafts are commonly done with 1 part Grand Marnier and 1 part 151.\\n\\nSection::::Alternate \"Shooter\" Backdraft preparation.\\nThe procedure is as follows:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Backdraft physics.\\nWhen a gas is heated, its volume increases. It will displace cooler gases as it expands. If this is done in a partially enclosed space, and the vessel allowed to be full of hot gas, when the heat is taken away, the gases cool and as they do, the amount of liquids that the gas can hold will decrease. Therefore, most of the moisture and alcohol held in the gas will condense. As the gas cools, it decreases in volume, and the pressure drops. Thus when the flaming alcohol in a backdraft is covered with a pint glass over a saucer, the dense, cold air is replaced with less dense, warm air with a lot of alcohol vapour held in it. As the oxygen flow to the fire is restricted, the remaining oxygen is used up and the fire in the pint glass goes out, removing the heat source. The alcohol-laden warm air now in the glass cools and begins to create a pressure difference. The air outside the pint glass forces its way into the partially evacuated pint glass and is responsible for pushing any liquid at the outside bottom of the pint glass further inside (as the seal of the glass and the saucer is not perfect) as it begins to equalise the pressure difference. Once the majority of the liquid is inside the upside down pint glass, sometimes further air can be seen to bubble up into the glass. At some point an equilibrium will occur, where the pressure difference between inside and outside of the glass is equal to the pressure of the column of liquid held up inside, and this will hold the liquid inside the glass. Sometimes, when a good seal is made, the pressure difference between the inside and the outside of the glass exerts a great enough force that when the glass is lifted, the saucer will remain stuck to its underside.\\n\\nWhen the pint glass is removed, ice is immediately added, thus causing the condensation of the alcohol vapour, creating a white mist in the glass by a process fairly similar to the formation of contrails. By covering the glass with the hand, this vapour is trapped until it is extracted by the process of inhalation, usually through a straw.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Backdraft (drink)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7725386'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'uQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7725958', 'text': 'William G.

Set in farm country outside the town of Claremore, Indian Territory, in 1906, it tells the story of farm girl Laurey Williams and her courtship by two rival suitors, cowboy Curly McLain and the sinister and frightening farmhand Jud Fry. A secondary romance concerns cowboy Will Parker and his flirtatious fiancÃ©e, Ado Annie.\\n\\nThe original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943. It was a box-office smash and ran for an unprecedented 2,212 performances, later enjoying award-winning revivals, national tours, foreign productions and an Academy Award-winning 1955 film adaptation. It has long been a popular choice for school and community productions. Rodgers and Hammerstein won a special Pulitzer Prize for \"Oklahoma!\" in 1944.\\n\\nThis musical, building on the innovations of the earlier \"Show Boat\", epitomized the development of the \"book musical\", a musical play where the songs and dances are fully integrated into a well-made story with serious dramatic goals that are able to evoke genuine emotions other than laughter. In addition, \"Oklahoma!\" features musical themes, or motifs, that recur throughout the work to connect the music and story. A fifteen-minute \"dream ballet\" reflects Laurey\\'s struggle with her feelings about two men, Curly and Jud.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nBy the early 1940s, Rodgers and Hammerstein were each well known for creating Broadway hits with other collaborators. Rodgers, with Lorenz Hart, had produced over two dozen musicals since the 1920s, including such popular successes as \"Babes in Arms\" (1937), \"The Boys from Syracuse\" (1938) and \"Pal Joey\" (1940). Among other successes, Hammerstein had written the words for \"Rose-Marie\" (1924), \"The Desert Song\" (1926), \"The New Moon\" (1927) and \"Show Boat\" (1927). Though less productive in the 1930s, he wrote musicals, songs and films, sharing an Academy Award for his song with Jerome Kern, \"The Last Time I Saw Paris\", which was included in the 1941 film \"Lady Be Good\". By the early 1940s, Hart had sunk into alcoholism and emotional turmoil, and he became unreliable, prompting Rodgers to approach Hammerstein to ask if he would consider working with him.\\n\\nSection::::Conception.\\nIn 1931, the Theatre Guild produced Lynn Riggs\\'s \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", a play about settlers in Oklahoma\\'s Indian Territory. Though the play was not successful, ten years later in 1941, Theresa Helburn, one of the Guild\\'s producers, saw a summer-stock production supplemented with traditional folk songs and square dances and decided the play could be the basis of a musical that might revive the struggling Guild. She contacted Richard Rodgers and Lorenz Hart, whose first successful collaboration, \"The Garrick Gaieties\", had been produced by the Theatre Guild in 1925. Rodgers wanted to work on the project and obtained the rights for himself and Hart. Rodgers had asked Oscar Hammerstein II to collaborate with him and Hart. During the tryouts of Rodgers and Hart\\'s \"By Jupiter\" in 1941, Hammerstein had assured Rodgers that if Hart was ever unable to work, he would be willing to take his place. Coincidentally in 1942, Hammerstein had thought of musicalizing \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", but when he had approached Jerome Kern about it, the latter declined. Hammerstein learned that Rodgers was seeking someone to write the book, and he eagerly took the opportunity. Hart lost interest in the musical; he preferred contemporary, urbane shows that would showcase his witty lyric writing, and he found the farmers and cowhands in \"Green Grow the Lilacs\" corny and uninspiring. Moreover, spiraling downward, consumed by his longstanding alcoholism, Hart no longer felt like writing. He embarked on a vacation to Mexico, advising Rodgers that Hammerstein would be a good choice of a new collaborator.\\n\\nThis partnership allowed both Rodgers and Hammerstein to follow their preferred writing methods: Hammerstein preferred to write a complete lyric before it was set to music, and Rodgers preferred to set completed lyrics to music. In Rodgers\\' previous collaborations with Hart, Rodgers had always written the music first, since the unfocused Hart needed something on which to base his lyrics. Hammerstein\\'s previous collaborators included composers Rudolf Friml, Herbert Stothart, Vincent Youmans, and Kern, who all wrote music first, for which Hammerstein then wrote lyrics. The role reversal in the Rodgers and Hammerstein partnership permitted Hammerstein to craft the lyrics into a fundamental part of the story so that the songs could amplify and intensify the story instead of diverting it. As Rodgers and Hammerstein began developing the new musical, they agreed that their musical and dramatic choices would be dictated by the source material, \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", not by musical comedy conventions. Musicals of that era featured big production numbers, novelty acts, and show-stopping specialty dances; the libretti typically focused on humor, with little dramatic development, punctuated with songs that effectively halted the story for their duration.\\n\\nSection::::Casting and development.\\nBetween the world wars, roles in musicals were usually filled by actors who could sing, but Rodgers and Hammerstein chose, conversely, to cast singers who could act. Though Theresa Helburn, codirector of the Theatre Guild, suggested Shirley Temple as Laurey and Groucho Marx as Ali Hakim, Rodgers and Hammerstein, with director Rouben Mamoulian\\'s support, insisted that performers more dramatically appropriate for the roles be cast. As a result, there were no stars in the production, another unusual step. The production was choreographed by Agnes de Mille (her first time choreographing a musical on Broadway), who provided one of the show\\'s most notable and enduring features: a 15-minute first-act ballet finale (often referred to as the dream ballet) depicting Laurey\\'s struggle to evaluate her suitors, Jud and Curly.\\n\\nThe first title given to the work was \"Away We Go!\" which opened for out-of-town-tryouts in New Haven\\'s Shubert Theatre on March 11, 1943. Expectations for the show were low; Hammerstein had written six flops in a row, and the show had no star power. Producer Mike Todd walked out after the first act during the tryout and wisecracked, \"No legs, no jokes, no chance.\" But Rodgers and Hammerstein were confident. The New Haven and Boston audiences were enthusiastic, although the reviews were only fair. Of the changes made before the show went to Broadway, two would prove significant: the addition of the show-stopping musical number, \"Oklahoma\" and the decision to retitle the musical after that number.\\n\\nTodd had been wrong; the show opened on Broadway to raves from the critics, sold out, and won a special Pulitzer Prize. Brooks Atkinson wrote in \"The New York Times\" that the show\\'s opening number, \"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin\\'\" changed the history of musical theater: \"After a verse like that, sung to a buoyant melody, the banalities of the old musical stage became intolerable.\" The \"New York Post\" was the only major paper to give \"Oklahoma!\" a mixed review. Its critic felt that while the songs were pleasant enough, they sounded much alike. The show\\'s creativity stimulated Rodgers and Hammerstein\\'s contemporaries and ushered in the \"Golden Age\" of American musical theatre.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nSection::::Act I.\\nIn Oklahoma territory in 1906, cowboy Curly McLain looks forward to the beautiful day ahead as he wanders into farm girl Laurey Williams\\'s yard (\"Oh, What a Beautiful Mornin\\'\"). He and Laurey tease each other, while her Aunt Eller looks on. There will be a box social dance that night, which includes an auction of lunch baskets prepared by the local women to raise funds for a schoolhouse. The man who wins each basket will eat the lunch with the lady who prepared it. Curly asks Laurey to go with him, but she refuses, feeling that he has waited too long. He attempts to persuade her by telling her that he will take her in the finest carriage money can buy (\"The Surrey with the Fringe on Top\"), but she teases him about it until he says he made it up to get back at her. She flounces off, not realizing that he really has rented such a rig.\\n\\nThe lonely, disturbed farm hand Jud Fry has become obsessed with Laurey and asks her to the dance. She accepts to spite Curly, although she is afraid of Jud. Meanwhile, cowboy Will Parker returns bedazzled and souvenir-laden from a trip to modern Kansas City (\"Kansas City\"). He won $50 at the fair, which, according to his girlfriend Ado Annie\\'s father, Andrew Carnes, is the money he needs to marry Ado Annie. Unfortunately, he spent all the money on gifts for her. Will also purchased a \"Little Wonder\" (a metal tube used for looking at pictures, but with a hidden blade inside) for Ado Annie\\'s father, unaware of its deadly secret. Later, Ado Annie confesses to Laurey that while Will has been away, she has been spending a lot of time with Ali Hakim, a Persian peddler. Laurey tells her she\\'ll have to choose between them, but Ado Annie insists she loves them both (\"I Cain\\'t Say No\"). Laurey and her friends prepare for the social, while Gertie Cummings flirts with Curly (her obnoxious laugh floating in to taunt Laurey). Laurey tells her friends that she doesn\\'t really care about Curly (\"Many a New Day\").\\n\\nAndrew Carnes discovers Annie with Ali Hakim. After questioning Ado Annie about their relationship, he forces Hakim at gunpoint to agree to marry her. Hakim and the other men lament the unfairness of the situation (\"It\\'s a Scandal! It\\'s a Outrage!\"). Curly discovers that Laurey is going to the box social with Jud and tries to convince her to go with him instead. Afraid to tell Jud she won\\'t go with him, Laurey tries to convince Curly (and herself) that she does not love him (\"People Will Say We\\'re in Love\"). Hurt by her refusal, Curly goes to the smokehouse where Jud lives to talk with him. Curly suggests that since Jud does not feel appreciated, he could hang himself, and everyone would realize how much they care about him (\"Pore Jud Is Daid\"). Their talk turns into an ominous confrontation about Laurey. After Curly leaves, Jud\\'s resolve to win Laurey becomes even stronger, and he vows to make her his bride (\"Lonely Room\").\\n\\nConfused by her feelings for Curly and her fear of Jud, Laurey purchases a \"magic potion\" (referred to as smelling salts, but actually laudanum) from Ali Hakim, which the unscrupulous peddler guarantees will reveal her true love. She muses on leaving her dreams of love behind and joining the man she loves (\"Out of My Dreams\"), then falls asleep under the influence of the opiate (\"Dream Sequence\"). In an extended dream ballet sequence, Laurey first dreams of what marriage to Curly would be like. Her dream takes a nightmarish turn when Jud appears and kills Curly. She cannot escape him, confused by her desires. The dream makes her realize that Curly is the right man for her, but it is too late to change her mind about going to the dance with Jud; he has come for her, and they leave for the box social.\\n\\nSection::::Act II.\\nAt the social, during an upbeat square dance (\"The Farmer and the Cowman\"), the rivalry between the local farmers and cowboys over fences and water rights has led to fighting, which Aunt Eller ends by firing a gun to silence everyone. Laurey is upset when she sees Curly at the dance with Gertie. In an effort to rid himself of Ado Annie, Ali Hakim buys Will\\'s souvenirs from Kansas City for $50. Jud also contributes to this by purchasing Will\\'s Little Wonder, knowing of the blade concealed within it. The auction starts and Will bids $50 on Ado Annie\\'s basket, not realizing that without the $50, he would no longer have the money her father insisted he needs to \"purchase\" marriage with her. Desperate to be rid of Ado Annie, the peddler bids $51 to get the basket so that Will can approach Andrew Carnes with the $50 and claim Ado Annie as his bride. The auction becomes much more serious when Laurey\\'s basket comes up for auction. Jud has saved all his money so he can win Laurey\\'s basket. Various men bid, trying to protect Laurey, but Jud outbids them all. Curly and Jud engage in a ferocious bidding war, and Curly sells his saddle, his horse, and even his gun to raise money. Curly outbids Jud and wins the basket. Jud discreetly tries to kill Curly with the Little Wonder, but his plan is foiled when Aunt Eller (knowing what is happening) loudly asks Curly for a dance. Later that night, Will and Annie work out their differences, as she reluctantly agrees not to flirt with other men (\"All Er Nuthin\\'\").\\n\\nJud confronts Laurey about his feelings for her. When she admits that she does not return them, he threatens her. She then fires him as her farm hand, screaming at him to get off her property. Jud furiously threatens Laurey before he departs; Laurey bursts into tears and calls for Curly. She tells him that she has fired Jud and is frightened by what Jud might do now. Curly, seeing that she has turned to him for guidance and safety, reassures her and proposes to her, and she accepts (\"People Will Say We\\'re In Love (Reprise)\"). He then realizes that he must now become a farmer. Afterwards, Ali Hakim decides to leave the territory and bids Ado Annie goodbye after telling her Will is the man she should marry.\\n\\nThree weeks later, Laurey and Curly are married and everyone rejoices in celebration of the territory\\'s impending statehood (\"Oklahoma\"). During the celebration, Ali Hakim returns with his new wife, Gertie, whom he unwillingly married after being threatened by her father with a shotgun. A drunken Jud reappears, harasses Laurey by kissing her and punches Curly, and they begin a fist fight. Jud attacks Curly with a knife and Curly dodges, causing Jud to fall on his own knife. Jud soon dies. The wedding guests hold a makeshift trial for Curly, at Aunt Eller\\'s urging, as the couple is due to leave for their honeymoon. The judge, Andrew Carnes, declares the verdict: \"not guilty!\" Curly and Laurey depart on their honeymoon in the surrey with the fringe on top (\"Finale Ultimo\").\\n\\nSection::::Principal roles and notable performers.\\nÂ° denotes original Broadway cast\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production history.\\nSection::::Original Broadway.\\nThe original Broadway production opened on March 31, 1943 at the St. James Theatre in New York City. It was directed by Rouben Mamoulian and choreographed by Agnes de Mille. It starred Alfred Drake (Curly), Joan Roberts (Laurey), Celeste Holm (Ado Annie), Howard Da Silva (Jud Fry), Betty Garde (Aunt Eller), Lee Dixon (Will Parker), Joseph Buloff (Ali Hakim), Jane Lawrence (Gertie), Barry Kelley (Ike) and George S. Irving (Joe). Marc Platt danced the role of \"Dream Curly\", Katharine Sergava danced the part of \"Dream Laurey\" and the small dancing part of Aggie was played by Bambi Linn. George Church danced the part of \"Dream Jud\" but was replaced by Vladimir Kostenko only two months after the premiere.\\n\\nThe production ran for 2,212 performances, finally closing on May 29, 1948. \"The demand for tickets was unprecedented as the show became more popular in the months that followed\" the opening. \"Oklahoma!\" ran for over five years, a Broadway record that \"would not be bested until \"My Fair Lady\" (1956).\" The Tony Awards and other awards now given for achievement in musical theatre were not in existence in 1943, and therefore the original production of \"Oklahoma!\" received no theatrical awards.\\n\\nSection::::Early U.S. tours.\\nThe \"first of several\" national tours began in New Haven, Connecticut, in 1944. A 1953 article in \"The New York Times\" reported that the show was \"believed to be the only musical to have enjoyed a consecutive run of ten years. It ran on Broadway for five years and two months, grossing $7,000,000. The tour of the national company, which started late in 1943, has grossed $15,000,000.\" John Raitt played Curly in the original production in Chicago. The United Service Organizations sponsored a tour to U.S. military bases in 1945 that lasted for several years. \"The New York Times\" reported in 1953: \\n\\nSection::::Original West End.\\n\"Oklahoma!\" was the first of a post-war wave of Broadway musicals to reach London\\'s West End. It starred Howard Keel (then known as Harold Keel) and Betty Jane Watson, opening at the Theatre Royal, Drury Lane on April 30, 1947 to rave press reviews and sellout houses, running for 1,543 performances. A pre-London run opened a day late at the Manchester Opera House on April 18, 1947, after the ship carrying the cast, scenery, and costumes ran aground on a sandbank off Southampton.\\n\\nSection::::1951 and 1979 Broadway revivals.\\nA 1951 revival produced by the Theatre Guild opened at The Broadway Theatre on May 9, 1951, and ran for 100 performances. Ridge Bond played Curly, Patricia Northrop played Laurey, Henry Clarke was Jud, and Jacqueline Sundt played Ado Annie. Mamoulian and de Mille returned to direct and choreograph, and the production was restaged by Jerome Whyte. In 1953, a 10th anniversary revival opened on August 31 at the New York City Center Theatre. It ran for a limited engagement of 40 performances before going on tour. The cast included Florence Henderson as Laurey, Ridge Bond as Curly and Barbara Cook as Annie. Mamoulian and De Mille directed and choreographed.\\n\\nA 1979 revival opened at the Palace Theatre on Broadway on December 13, 1979 and closed on August 24, 1980, running for 293 performances and nine previews. William Hammerstein (Oscar\\'s son) directed, and Gemze de Lappe recreated Agnes De Mille\\'s choreography. The show starred Christine Andreas as Laurey, Laurence Guittard as Curly, Mary Wickes as Aunt Eller, Christine Ebersole as Ado Annie, Martin Vidnovic as Jud Fry, Harry Groener as Will Parker and Bruce Adler as Ali Hakim. Andreas and Groener both received Tony Award nominations for their performances, and Vidnovic won a Drama Desk Award. This production started as a cross-country national tour, beginning at the Pantages Theater in Los Angeles on May 1, 1979.\\n\\nSection::::1980 and 1998 West End revivals.\\nThe following year, James Hammerstein directed a production at the Haymarket Theatre, Leicester, in January 1980, produced by Cameron Mackintosh. The De Mille choreography was again adapted by de Lappe. A UK tour followed, and it eventually settled in the West End, opening at the Palace Theatre, London, on September 17, 1980, and running until September 19, 1981. This production starred John Diedrich as Curly and Alfred Molina as Jud Fry, both of whom were nominated for Olivier Awards. Rosamund Shelley played Laurey, and Madge Ryan was Aunt Eller. The production was Maria Friedman\\'s debut in the West End, initially in the chorus role of Doris, but she was eventually promoted to the leading role. John Owen Edwards was the musical director. He would later reprise his work for Mackintosh\\'s 1998 London revival. A cast recording of this production was issued by JAY Records and on the \"Showtime!\" label.\\nA dark-themed production of the musical was presented by the National Theatre in London at the Olivier Theatre, opening on July 15, 1998. The production team included Trevor Nunn (director), Susan Stroman (choreographer) and William David Brohn (orchestrator). The international cast included Hugh Jackman as Curly, Maureen Lipman as Aunt Eller, Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey, Shuler Hensley as Jud Fry, Vicki Simon as Ado Annie, Peter Polycarpou as Ali Hakim and Jimmy Johnston as Will Parker. Musical director John Owen Edwards, Brohn and dance arranger David Krane adapted Robert Russell Bennett\\'s original orchestrations and extended some of the dance sequences. A new Dream Ballet was composed for Susan Stroman\\'s new choreography, and the dances to \"Kansas City\", \"Many a New Day\" and \"The Farmer and the Cowman\" were all redesigned. The overture was also altered, at the request of Nunn.\\n\\nThe production received numerous Olivier Award nominations, winning for Outstanding Musical Production, supporting actor (Hensley), set design (Anthony Ward) and choreography (Stroman). According to the Rodgers & Hammerstein Organization, the limited engagement was a sell-out and broke all previous box office records, and so the show was transferred to the Lyceum Theatre in the West End for a six-month run. Plans to transfer to Broadway with the London cast were thwarted by Actors\\' Equity, which insisted that American actors must be cast. Eventually a U.S. cast was selected. The production was filmed and issued on DVD, as well as being broadcast on U.S. Public Television in November 2003.\\n\\nSection::::2002 Broadway revival.\\nThe London production was repeated on Broadway at the George Gershwin Theatre on March 21, 2002, with direction by Nunn. The production closed on February 23, 2003 after 388 performances. Only two of the London cast, Josefina Gabrielle as Laurey and Shuler Hensley as Jud, were in the production, which also featured Patrick Wilson as Curly and Andrea Martin as Aunt Eller. It was nominated for seven Tony Awards, including Best Revival of a Musical, Best Featured Actress in a Musical and Best Featured Actor in a Musical (which was awarded to Hensley). The musical was also nominated for nine Drama Desk Awards, with Hensley winning as Outstanding Featured Actor in a Musical and Susan Stroman winning for choreography.\\n\\nBen Brantley wrote in \"The New York Times\": \"At its best, which is usually when it\\'s dancing, this resurrection of Rodgers and Hammerstein\\'s epochal show is dewy with an adolescent lustiness, both carnal and naive, exuberant and confused.\" The review stated that \"Anthony Ward\\'s harmoniously curved set, in which the sky seems to stretch into eternity, again pulses with the promise of a land on the verge of transformation.\" The \"New York Daily News\" review commented that \"Visually, this one is stunning â at times, Anthony Ward\\'s sets have a pastoral, idyllic quality, like Thomas Hart Benton\\'s paintings. At other times, especially in lighting designer David Hersey\\'s lustrous palette, they convey the bleakness of the frontier.\" The review also stated that the Royal National Theatre \"brought it back to us in a way that makes it seem fresh and vital.\" However, \"USA Today\" gave the production a tepid assessment, its reviewer writing that \"A cold breeze blows through this beautiful mornin\\', and that golden haze is never quite bright enough.\" The production went on to tour nationally from 2003â2005.\\n\\nSection::::2019 Broadway revival.\\nFollowing a 2015 workshop at Bard College and a 2018 run at Brooklyn\\'s St. Ann\\'s Warehouse, a 75th anniversary staging of \"Oklahoma!\" transferred to Broadway at Circle in the Square Theatre. The production is directed by Daniel Fish in an intimate, immersive style, set in a community hall, with chili and cornbread served to the audience at intermission. The production began preview performances on March 19, 2019 and officially opened on April 7 for a limited run through September 1. It stars Rebecca Naomi Jones as Laurey, Damon Daunno as Curley, Ali Stroker as Ado Annie, James Davis as Will Parker, Will Brill as Ali Hakim, Patrick Vaill as Jud and Mary Testa as Aunt Eller. The production features choreography by John Heginbotham and new music arrangements by Daniel Kluger, performed by a seven-piece band.\\n\\n\"Oklahoma!\" was presented nightly except Sundays each summer at the Discoveryland amphitheater, an outdoor theatre in Sand Springs, Oklahoma, from 1977 until 2011. In 1993, Mary Rodgers (daughter of Richard Rodgers) and William Hammerstein (son of Oscar Hammerstein II) designated Discoveryland the \"National Home of Rodgers and Hammerstein\\'s \"Oklahoma!\"\"\\n\\nIn 2006, \"Oklahoma!\" was performed in Japan by the all-female Takarazuka Revue. This revival starred Yuu Todoroki, Ai Shirosaki, and Hiromu Kiriya.\\n\\nIn the summer of 2009, British director John Doyle directed the musical at the Chichester Festival Theatre. The production was dark in concept and featured new orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick. On a spare stage, decorated only with blue sheets, \"Confetti of rose petals stains the floor like drops of blood, and a nightmarish dream-dance sequence has Freudian overtones as Laurey\\'s bridal gown becomes her shroud.\" It received mixed reviews. \"The Times\" reviewer wrote: \"This is a very stylised, overdrilled production, no friend of intimate moments or quiet depth of emotion.\" \"The Guardian\" liked it the most, stating that \"it\\'s a delight, with one brilliant tippy-tappy-toed song after another and a nugget of darkness lodged in its sweet heart.\" \"Whats On Stage\", like most of the papers, gave the show three out of five stars and wrote that this is a \"downbeat vision\" and that \"all told it\\'s a somewhat disappointing show\", but their \"average reader rating\" was four stars. A review in \"The Telegraph\" commented, \"Doyle uses shadow and silhouette to bring out the musical\\'s nightmarish aspects but doesn\\'t over-labour them. There are enough sunny spots â no more so than in Act 2\\'s rousing title song â to keep the tone evenly textured.\"\\n\\nThe show toured England for nine months in 2010 in a new staging by Julian Woolford, with Marti Webb as Aunt Eller and Mark Evans as Curly.\\n\\n\"Oklahoma!\" opened in October 2010 at the Arena Stage to critical acclaim. Artistic Director Molly Smith cast African-American actresses as Laurey and Aunt Eller to mirror both modern Washington, D.C. demographics and the diverse population of the musical\\'s 1906 Oklahoma territory setting. The production received ten 2011 Helen Hayes Award nominations, winning as Outstanding Resident Musical (tying with Shakespeare Theatre\\'s \"Candide\") and for choreography (Parker Esse), lead actor (Nicholas Rodriguez as Curly) and musical direction (George Fulginiti-Shakar). The production returned to the Arena Stage for a second run in 2011.\\n\\nThe 5th Avenue Theatre\\'s 2012 production, directed by Peter Rothstein, included African-American dancers and an African-American actor as Jud. The choice was intended, as in the Arena Stage production, to reflect the historical presence of African Americans in the Oklahoma territory, but it \"has some audience members squirming in their seats ... they\\'re seeing on stage one of the ugliest stereotypes in our history: an imposing black man ravaging a petite white woman [and] the white hero ... all but urges Jud to hang himself â and even pantomimes the act. Some see a clear reference to lynching.\" The \"Dream Ballet\" had a sinister, sexual tone and ended with Jud dragging Laurey away to be raped. One critic noted the historical \"license taken when an African-American farmhand is allowed to escort a white woman to the box dance. ... Maybe some people ... left with not so much a song in their head, but a question in their heart. And isn\\'t that part of what theater is supposed to do?\" Another wrote: \"Rothstein\\'s \"Oklahoma!\" is now the story of a crazy, sex obsessed black man ... lusting violently after his white mistress, who ends up murdered at the hands of a white man, who gets off scot free after a mock trial.\"\\n\\nA UK tour ran from February to August 2015, directed by Rachel Kavanaugh and starring Ashley Day as Curly, Charlotte Wakefield as Laurey, Belinda Lang as Aunt Eller and Gary Wilmot as Ali Hakim.\\n\\nSection::::1955 film adaptation.\\nThe 1955 film adaptation starred Gordon MacRae, Shirley Jones (in her film debut), Rod Steiger, Charlotte Greenwood, Gloria Grahame, Gene Nelson, James Whitmore and Eddie Albert. It was the only musical film directed by Fred Zinnemann, and Agnes de Mille choreographed. It was the first feature film photographed in the Todd-AO 70 mm widescreen process.\\n\\nRodgers and Hammerstein personally oversaw the film to prevent the studio from making the changes that were then typical of stage-to-film musical adaptations, such as interpolating new songs by others. The film followed the stage version more closely than any other Rodgers and Hammerstein stage-to-film adaptation, although it divided the long first scene into several shorter scenes, changing the locations of several of the songs. For example, \"Kansas City\" is performed at the train station, where Aunt Eller and other cowboys meet Will Parker just after he returns from Kansas City. Lyrics in the song about a burlesque stripteaser were slightly changed to pass film censorship. In a nod to \"Green Grow the Lilacs\", which was the basis of the musical, Jud attempts revenge on Curly and Laurey by burning a haystack they stand on, before Curly jumps down, landing on Jud and causing him to fall on his own knife. The film omits only \"It\\'s a Scandal, It\\'s an Outrage\" and \"Lonely Room\". The film won Academy Awards for Best Music, Scoring of a Musical Picture and Best Sound, Recording.\\nSection::::Recordings.\\nMost of the songs from \"Oklahoma!\" were released on a record album by Decca Records in 1943 containing six 10-inch double-sided discs in 78 RPM format. It was the first U.S. cast album featuring the original Broadway cast of a musical. It sold over a million copies, prompting the label to call the cast back into the studio to record three additional selections that had been left out of the first set. These were issued as \"Oklahoma! Volume Two\". In 1949, Decca re-released the first set on LP but not the second set, which soon became a very rare collectors\\' item. All subsequent LP releases were similarly incomplete. Finally in 2000, Decca Broadway went back to the original glass masters to generate a new high fidelity transfer of the complete song program and released it on CD, utilizing the original 78 album artwork.\\n\\nThe success of the original \"Oklahoma!\" cast album set a precedent for the production of original cast recordings of Broadway musicals, which became an essential part of a musical\\'s dissemination and endurance in popular culture. Later cast recordings of \"Oklahoma!\" include the 1979 Broadway revival cast recording, the 1980 London revival cast recording, the 1998 Royal National Theatre revival cast recording, and a soundtrack album of the 1955 film. There have also been more than 20 studio cast recordings of the show, featuring stars such as Nelson Eddy, John Raitt and Florence Henderson in the leading roles.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nThe original production of \"Oklahoma!\" was an unprecedented critical and popular success. John Anderson of the \"New York Journal American\" pronounced the musical \"a beautiful and delightful show, fresh and imaginative, as enchanting to the eye as Richard Rodgers\\'s music is to the ear. It has, at a rough estimate, practically everything\". In the \"New York Herald Tribune\", Howard Barnes wrote, \"Songs, dances, and a story have been triumphantly blended. ... The Richard Rodgers score is one of his best, and that is saying plenty. Oscar Hammerstein 2nd has written a dramatically imaginative libretto and a string of catchy lyrics; Agnes de Mille has worked small miracles in devising original dances to fit the story and the tunes, while Rouben Mamoulian has directed an excellent company with great taste and craftsmanship.\" Louis Kronenberger of \"PM\" opined that \"Mr. Hammerstein\\'s lyrics have less crispness and wit than Lorenz Hart\\'s at their best, but the songs in \"Oklahoma!\" call for less sophisticated words, and Mr. Hammerstein has found very likeable ones.\"\\n\\nIn the \"New York Daily News\", Burns Mantle declared that \"\"Oklahoma!\" really is different â beautifully different. With the songs that Richard Rodgers has fitted to a collection of unusually atmospheric and intelligible lyrics by Oscar Hammerstein 2nd, \"Oklahoma!\" seems to me to be the most thoroughly and attractively American musical comedy since Edna Ferber\\'s \"Show Boat\"\". \"New York World-Telegram\" critic Burton Rascoe particularly emphasized the groundbreaking choreography, stating that \"Richard Rodgers has written for the show one of the finest musical scores any musical play ever had. Next to Mr. Rodgers, however, must stand the amazing Agnes de Mille, whose choreography, carried out to perfection by her ballet [corps], is actually the biggest hit of the show. The \"Out of My Dreams\" and \"All Er Nuthin\\'\" dances are such supreme aesthetic delights. ... They are spinetingling, out of this world.\" In \"The New York Sun\", Ward Morehouse commented that \"\"Oklahoma!\" is charming and leisurely. And tunely. And certainly not topical,\" as other shows had been in the early years of World War II. \"It reveals Mr. Rodgers, shorn only for the moment of Larry Hart, in good form indeed. And nobody in last night\\'s audience seemed to have a better time than Mr. Hart himself, who applauded the proceedings from a seat in Row B.\" Lorenz Hart himself \"pushed his way through the crowd at the after-show party in Sardi\\'s restaurant and threw his arms around his ex-partner, grinning from ear to ear. He told Rodgers he had never had a better evening at the theater in his life.\"\\n\\nThe only negative review of the musical appeared in the \"New York Post\": The critic wrote that \"it all seemed just a trifle too cute\", stating that the score consisted of \"a flock of Mr. Rodgers\\'s songs that are pleasant enough, but still manage to sound quite a bit alike ... without much variety in the presentation.\" She concluded that the show was \"very picturesque in a studied fashion, reminding us that life on a farm is apt to become a little tiresome.\"\\n\\nSection::::Antecedents and influence.\\nAccording to playwright and theatre writer Thomas Hischak, \"Not only is \\'Oklahoma!\\' the most important of the Rodgers and Hammerstein musicals, it is also the single most influential work in the American musical theatre. ... It is the first fully integrated musical play and its blending of song, character, plot and even dance would serve as the model for Broadway shows for decades.\" William Zinsser observed that \"Oklahoma!\" broke the old \"musical comedy conventions\", with the songs \"delving into character\" and advancing the plot. The show \"became a milestone, so that later historians writing about important moments in twentieth-century theatre would begin to identify eras according to their relationship to \"Oklahoma!\"\" \"Oklahoma!\" made Rodgers and Hammerstein \"the most important contributors to the musical-play form. ... The examples they set in creating vital plays, often rich with social thought, provided the necessary encouragement for other gifted writers to create musical plays of their own\".\\n\\nTheater historian Ethan Mordden points out that, although \"Oklahoma!\" has been called \"the first integrated musical, the first American folk musical\", \"Show Boat\" \"got there first on both counts.\" Even earlier, the Princess Theatre musicals, following Gilbert and Sullivan and French \"opÃ©ra bouffe\", began the reintegration of song and story after decades of thinly plotted British and American musicals, paving the way for \"Show Boat\" and \"Oklahoma!\" by showing that a musical could combine popular entertainment with continuity between its story and songs. These Princess Theatre shows, which featured modern American settings, \"built and polished the mold from which almost all later major musical comedies evolved. ... The characters and situations were, within the limitations of musical comedy license, believable and the humor came from the situations or the nature of the characters. Kern\\'s exquisitely flowing melodies were employed to further the action or develop characterization.\" Mordden also notes that \"Oklahoma!\" was called the first great dance musical, but other musicals had earlier focused on dance, among them \"Gay Divorce\" and \"On Your Toes\". He concludes: \"But \"Oklahoma!\" was the first American musical with an ethnic sound, words and music entirely in the folk idiom.\"\\n\\nSection::::In popular culture.\\n\"Oklahoma!\" has frequently been quoted or parodied in films, television and other media.

It is the first regional natural gas transmission system in sub-Saharan Africa.\\nSection::::History.\\nThe project began in 1982, when the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) proposed the development of a natural gas pipeline throughout West Africa. In 1991 a feasibility report conducted by the World Bank on supplying Nigerian gas on West African markets deemed that a project was commercially viable.\\n\\nIn September 1995, the governments of four African countries signed a Heads of State Agreement. The feasibility study was carried out in 1999. On 11 August 1999, a Memorandum of Understanding was signed by participating countries in Cotonou, Benin. In February 2000, an Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed. The WAGP implementation agreement was signed in 2003. Groundbreaking ceremonies for the project were held at Sekondi-Takoradi, Ghana, on 3 December 2004. Construction began in 2005.\\n\\nThe offshore pipeline was completed in December 2006 and was scheduled to start operating on 23 December 2007 but was delayed after leaks were detected in supply pipelines in Nigeria. The second delivery deadline was scheduled on 13 February 2008, but regular deliveries were delayed again, when one of the contractors of Willbros was shot and killed in Nigeria by armed robbers.\\n\\nGas deliveries were expected by the end of 2009 after commissioning regulating and metering stations in Takoradi and Tema, Ghana, Lagos Beach, Nigeria, Cotonou, Benin, and LomÃ©, Togo in May 2008. However, deliveries were postponed again due to an irregular amount of moisture found inside the onshore gas pipeline.\\n\\nSection::::Route.\\nThe pipeline consists three sections with a total length of . The long offshore section starts at starts the Itoki terminal in southeastern Nigeria and runs through the waters of Benin, Togo and Ghana parallel to the coastline, approximately to offshore in water depths of between and . The Nigerian onshore section of the pipeline connects the offshore section compressor station at Lagos Beach with the Chevron-owned EscravosâLagos Pipeline System, operational since 1989. It is possible that later the WAGP will be extended to CÃ´te d'Ivoire and in longer term even to Senegal.\\n\\nSection::::Technical description.\\nThe diameter of the onshore section is . The diameter of the offshore pipeline is and the capacity is 5\\xa0billion cubic meter (bcm) of natural gas per year. The pipeline was constructed by Willbros, with Bredero Shaw Ltd applying a concrete coating to the pipeline at its facility in Tema, Ghana. The pre-commissioning services were provided by BJ Process and Pipeline Services. The total pipeline costs around US$974\\xa0million, for which the World Bank provided a guarantee of $50\\xa0million for Ghana, while the Multilateral Investment Guarantee Agency provided a $75\\xa0million political risk guarantee for WAGPo as a whole.\\n\\nSection::::Project company.\\nThe pipeline is owned by West African Gas Pipeline Company Limited (WAGPCo), a consortium of Chevron (36.7%), Nigerian National Petroleum Corporation (25%), Royal Dutch Shell (18%), Volta River Authority of Ghana (16.3%), SociÃ©tÃ© Togolaise de Gaz (SoToGaz - 2%) and SociÃ©tÃ© Beninoise de Gaz S.A.

Score pitched for the Cleveland Indians from 1955 through 1959 and the Chicago White Sox from 1960 through 1962. He was the American League (AL) Rookie of the Year in 1955, and an AL All-Star in 1955 and 1956. Due to an on-field injury that occurred in 1957, he retired early as a player in 1962. Score was a television and radio broadcaster for the Cleveland Indians from 1964 through 1997. He was inducted into the Cleveland Indians Hall of Fame in 2006.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nHerb Score was born in Rosedale, New York, in 1933. At 3, he was run over by a truck and later had rheumatic fever. As a teenager, he started playing basketball and baseball at Holy Name of Mary School until he moved with his family to Lake Worth, Florida. In 1952, he threw six no-hitters for the Lake Worth Community High School baseball team, when the school won its only state baseball championship.\\n\\nOn June 7, 1952 (his 19th birthday), he signed a baseball contract with the Cleveland Indians. He was sent to Indianapolis of the American Association where he made 10 pitching starts. In 1953, he moved to Cleveland\\'s Class A affiliate, Reading (Pennsylvania) of the Eastern League. At Reading, he became a roommate and lifetime friend with Rocky Colavito, a near future Cleveland Indians home run hitter and right fielder from the Bronx, New York. For the 1954 season, both were promoted to Triple-A Indianapolis. Score was named \"The Sporting News\" Minor League Player of the Year and began to be referred to as \"left-handed Bob Feller\".\\n\\nSection::::MLB playing career.\\nSection::::Cleveland Indians (1955â1959).\\nIn , Score came up to the Major Leagues (with Colavito) as a rookie with the Cleveland Indians at the age of 21. He quickly became one of the top power pitchers in the American League, no small feat on a team that still included Bob Feller, Bob Lemon and other top pitchers, going 16â10 with a 2.85 Earned run average (ERA) in his first year. He appeared on the cover of \"Sports Illustrated\" magazine on May 30, 1955. Score struck out 245 batters in 1955, a Major League rookie record that stood until , when it was topped by Dwight Gooden (Score, Gooden, Grover Cleveland Alexander, Don Sutton, Gary Nolan, Kerry Wood, Mark Langston, and Hideo Nomo were the only eight rookie pitchers to top 200 strikeouts in the 20th century). It was the first time in MLB history a regular starting pitcher averaged over one strikeout per inning.\\n\\nIn , Score improved on his rookie campaign, going 20â9 with a 2.53 ERA and 263 strikeouts, while reducing the number of walks from 154 to 129, and allowed only 5.85 hits/9 innings, which would stand as a franchise record until it was broken by Luis Tiant\\'s 5.30 in .\\n\\nSection::::Injury from Gil McDougald\\'s line drive.\\nOn May 7, , during the first inning of a night game against the New York Yankees at Municipal Stadium in Cleveland, Score threw a low fastball to Gil McDougald with Jim Hegan catching. McDougald lined the pitch to the mound and struck Score in the face, breaking Score\\'s facial bones and injuring his eye. The ball caromed to third baseman Al Smith, who threw McDougald out before he rushed to the pitching mound to aid Score. McDougald, seeing Score hit by the baseball and then lying down and injured, also ran immediately to the pitching mound, instead of first base, to help Score. McDougald reportedly vowed to retire if Score permanently lost his sight in one eye as a result of the accident. Score eventually recovered his 20/20 vision, though he missed the rest of the season.\\n\\nHe returned early in the season. Though many believe Score feared being hit by another batted ball, and thus changed his pitching motion, Score himself rejected that theory. Score would tell Cleveland sportswriter Terry Pluto (for \"The Curse of Rocky Colavito\") that, in 1958, after pitching and winning a few games and feeling better than he\\'d felt in a long time, he tore a tendon in his arm while pitching on a damp night against the Washington Senators and sat out the rest of the season.\\n\\nIn 1959, he had shifted his pitching motion in a bid to avoid another, similar injury. \"The reason my motion changed\", Score told Pluto, \"was because I hurt my elbow, and I overcompensated for it and ended up with some bad habits.\" As a result of the changes Score made in his pitching delivery, his velocity dropped and he incurred further injuries. Score pitched the full season, going 9â11 with a 4.71 ERA and 147 strikeouts.\\n\\nIn the book \"The Greatest Team Of All Time\" (Bob Adams, Inc, publisher. 1994), Mickey Mantle picked Score as the toughest American League left-handed pitcher he faced (before the injury). Yogi Berra picked Score for his \"Greatest Team Of All Time\".\\n\\nSection::::Chicago White Sox (1960â1962).\\nScore was traded to the Chicago White Sox by Cleveland on April 18, 1960 for pitcher Barry Latman. Score\\'s roommate, Colavito, was traded to the Detroit Tigers the day before. Score was reunited on the Chicago team with some former Indians players and manager Al Lopez. Score pitched parts of the following three seasons before retiring. He finished with a major league career record of 55â46, a 3.36 ERA, and 837 strikeouts over eight seasons in 858 innings pitched.\\n\\nSection::::MLB broadcasting career.\\nScore retired from playing baseball in 1962. Beginning in 1964, he was employed as a television and radio play-by-play announcer with the Cleveland Indians for the next 34 years, first on television from to , and then on radio from to , the longest career for an Indians play-by-play announcer. Score was revered by the Indians fans for his announcing style, including a low voice and a low-key style, as well as a habit of occasionally mispronouncing the names of players on opposing teams. Score\\'s final Major League Baseball game as an announcer was Game 7 of the 1997 World Series.\\n\\nSection::::Retirement and death.\\nOn October 8, 1998, while driving to Florida after being inducted into the Broadcasters Hall of Fame the night before, Score was severely injured in a traffic accident. He pulled into the path of a westbound tractor-trailer truck near New Philadelphia, Ohio, and his car was struck in the passenger side. He suffered trauma to his brain, chest, and lungs. The orbital bone around one of his eyes was fractured, as were three ribs and his sternum. He spent over a month in the intensive care unit, and was released from MetroHealth Hospital in mid-December. He was cited for failure to stop at a stop sign.\\n\\nHe went through a difficult recovery, but managed to throw out the first pitch at the Indians\\' Opening Day on April 12, 1999. He suffered a stroke in 2002, and died on November 11, 2008, at his home in Rocky River, Ohio, after a lengthy illness. He is interred at Lakewood Park Cemetery in Rocky River.

In 1909 he became the editor of the \"Washington Times\". He left this post in 1917 to become Special Assistant to the Secretary of the Navy and to serve as a member of the Committee on Public Information under George Creel and as publicity director for United States Navy during the First World War until 1921. In this Navy connection McIntyre first met Roosevelt, then Assistant Secretary of the Navy.\\n\\nHe served as publicity representative and business manager for several of FDR\\'s campaigns and after the Democratic defeat in 1920, he remained in Washington DC, contributing articles to Army and Navy Journals and later becoming representative of the PathÃ© News Reel Company.

(film)\\n\\nStar! (re-titled Those Were the Happy Times for its 1969 re-release) is a 1968 American biographical musical film directed by Robert Wise and starring Julie Andrews. The screenplay by William Fairchild is based on the life and career of British performer Gertrude Lawrence.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nThe film opens in 1940, with Lawrence in a screening room watching a documentary film chronicling her life, then flashes back to Clapham in 1915, when she leaves home to join her vaudevillian father in a dilapidated Brixton music hall. Eventually she joins the chorus in AndrÃ© Charlot\\'s West End revue. She reunites with close childhood friend NoÃ«l Coward who provides witty commentary on Gertie\\'s actions.\\n\\nCharlot becomes annoyed with Gertie\\'s efforts to stand out, literally, from the chorus. He threatens to fire her, but stage manager Jack Roper intercedes and gets her hired as a general understudy to the leads. She marries Jack, but it becomes clear she is more inclined to perform onstage than stay home and play wife. While pregnant, she insists on going on for an absent star, and captivates the audience with her own star-making performance of \"Burlington Bertie\". Charlot and Roper witness the audience\\'s warm approval, and both realize, Charlot grudgingly and Roper wistfully, that Gertie belongs on the stage.\\n\\nAfter their daughter Pamela is born, Gertrude is angered when Roper takes the baby on a pub crawl, and leaves him. A subsequent courtship with Sir Anthony Spencer, an English nobleman, polishes Gertie\\'s rough edges and transforms her into a lady. Caught at a chic supper club when she is supposed to be on a sick day, she is fired from the Charlot Revue. Squired by Spencer, she becomes a \\'society darling\\'. Coward then convinces Charlot to feature her in his new production, and she is finally recognized as a star. When the revue opens in New York City, she dallies with an actor and a banker, bringing the number of her suitors to three.\\n\\nGertrude faces financial ruin after spending all her considerable earnings, but ultimately manages to pay back her creditors and retain her glamour. As her career soars, her long-distance relationship with her daughter deteriorates. When Pamela cancels an anticipated holiday with Gertie, she gets extremely drunk and insults a roomful of people at a surprise birthday party thrown by Coward. Among the people insulted at the party is American theatre producer Richard Aldrich. When he returns to escort the hungover star home, he gives an honest appraisal of her. She is insulted, then intrigued by him, making an unannounced visit to his Cape Playhouse where she proposes to play the lead. They argue at rehearsal. He proposes marriage; she throws him out.\\n\\nBack on Broadway, she has trouble getting a handle on a crucial \"The Saga of Jenny\" number in \"Lady in the Dark\". Aldrich turns up at a daunting rehearsal where he observes her frustration and takes her, with Coward, out to a nightclub. She protests, then realizes the kind of performance they are watching is the key to her dilemma in the show. Coward pronounces him \"a very clever man\". After a rousing performance of \"Jenny\", the film ends with her marriage to Aldrich, eight years before her triumph in \"The King and I\" and untimely death from liver cancer at the age of 54.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nAccording to extensive production details provided in the DVD release of the film, when Julie Andrews signed on to star in \"The Sound of Music\", her contract with Twentieth Century-Fox was a two-picture deal. As \"The Sound of Music\" neared completion, director Robert Wise and producer Saul Chaplin had grown so fond of her that they wanted to make sure that their team would be the one to pick up the studio\\'s option for the other picture \"before anybody else got to her first\". Wise\\'s story editor Max Lamb suggested a biopic of Lawrence and, although Andrews previously had rejected offers to portray the entertainer, she was as keen to work with Wise and Chaplin again as they were to work with her, and she subsequently warmed to their approach to the story. She signed for $1 million against 10 percent of the gross plus 35 cents for each soundtrack album sold.\\n\\nOnce Andrews was on board, Wise bought the rights to both Lawrence\\'s 1945 autobiography \"A Star Danced\" and her second husband\\'s 1954 memoir \"Gertrude Lawrence as Mrs. A.\" Max Lamb did extensive research, including numerous interviews with people who actually had known Lawrence. It became clear that the interviews provided a more accurate account than the rosy picture in the books, so they became the basis of the screenplay. Wise felt it was important to hire a British screenwriter, and he decided on William Fairchild. The contrast of the rosy impression of her life in the books with the less glamorous real story from the interviews found its way into the script, which initially had an animated Lawrence telling the story while the live version played out what (more or less) really happened. Eventually, Fairchild suggested Lawrence\\'s story be told in (color) flashback while she watched a (black-and-white) documentary about her life, thus allowing the real Lawrence in a screening room set to comment on the veracity of the character Lawrence in the film within the film.\\n\\nFairchild\\'s screenplay renamed, replaced or combined some real people, for dramatic and legal reasons. Two of Lawrence\\'s closest friends, NoÃ«l Coward and Beatrice Lillie, were approached regarding the rights to portray them in the film. While Coward was generally supportive, suggesting only small alterations to his character\\'s dialogue, Lillie had a manager who demanded that she play herself, in addition to numerous script changes that enlarged her role. Wise then asked Fairchild to find the name of another female performer Lawrence had worked with who was already dead. Billie Carleton became the composite character that replaced Lillie in the film. When Lawrence reconnects with her wayward father in the film, he is performing in music halls with a mature woman who joins him when he departs for a job in South Africa. In reality Rose was a chorus girl not much older than Lawrence, and she remained in the UK. On screen, Lawrence\\'s first husband Jack Roper is roughly her age, whereas in real life his name was Francis Gordon-Howley and he was twenty years her senior. Her upper-class Guardsman boyfriend, actually Capt. Philip Astley, is identified as Sir Tony Spencer on screen, and the Wall Street financier named Ben Mitchell in the film was really Bert Taylor.\\n\\nDaniel Massey, who portrayed NoÃ«l Coward, was Coward\\'s godson in real life. His performance earned one of the seven Academy Award nominations for the film. In his commentary for the laserdisc and DVD release of the film, Massey reveals he was unhappy with the sound of his voice when he saw the film for the first time. As production wrapped in late 1967, heâat his own requestâre-dubbed all of his dialogue before returning home to London. Massey\\'s commentary also recounts a conversation in which Coward addressed his own sexual orientation, which is barely hinted at in the film. Massey quotes Coward saying \"I\\'ve tried it all, from soup to nuts...\" confirming his preference for the latter.\\n\\nMichael Kidd choreographed the musical sequences. Both he and Andrews have talked about his pushing her beyond what she thought her limits were, particularly for \"Burlington Bertie\" and \"Jenny\"âwhich turned out to be among her best moments on film. Andrews has said that her lasting friendship with Kidd and his dance assistant and wife Shelah is one of the things she valued most from the experience. Boris Leven was responsible for the production design and his sets took over nine different stages on the Fox lot. Fashion designer Donald Brooks designed 3,040 individual costumes for the film, including a record 125 outfits for Andrews alone. The $750,000 cost of Andrews\\' wardrobe was subsidized by Western Costume company, which took ownership after filming. Western rented them out to many subsequent TV and movie productions, (including \"Funny Lady\") for over 20 years, then auctioned most of them, along with hundreds of other famous costumes, at Butterfield & Butterfield\\'s in West Hollywood.\\n\\nSection::::Theatrical release.\\nAt a time when the popularity of roadshow theatrical releases in general, and musicals in particular, were on the wane, the United States was one of the last countries in which the film was released. When the film was in production, 15,000 people responded to promotional ads placed by 20th Century Fox for advance ticket sales in New York City, but a year later, when the studio followed up by mailing them order forms, only a very small percentage actually bought tickets. Sales were higher for Wednesday matinees than for Saturday nights, which indicated that a crucial componentâyoung adultsâwould not be a large part of the picture\\'s audience. The film opened in the US with little advance sale, and good-to-mediocre reviews.\\n\\n\"Star!\" was a commercial disappointment in its initial run, suffering about 20 minutes of studio-requested and director-approved cuts, while still in its roadshow engagements. Hoping to recoup some of its estimated $14 million cost, 20th Century Fox executive Richard Zanuck decided to do some primitive \"market research\" (testing three titles: \"Music for the Lady\", \"Those Were the Happy Days\" and \"Star!\"), before withdrawing the film in the spring of 1969. The studio then proceeded to substantially cut and re-market the film under a new title, \"Those Were the Happy Times\". Wise, who did not believe cutting the film would work, declined to be involved in the editing, and asked that the credit \"A Robert Wise Film\" be removed. Following instructions from Zanuck, William H. Reynolds, the film\\'s original editor, reluctantly but very competently removed scenes and whole sequences, including many of the musical numbers, paring the film\\'s running time from 175 to 120 minutes, (which involved overlapping sound and adding a new shot to bridge some cuts). A very simple new title card was created as well. However, when the short retitled version was released in the fall of 1969, the changes left some holes in the plot, and did little to improve box office receipts. The fact that the reissue was to be shown only in 35mm coincidentally saved the original camera negative of the film from being altered.\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nRenata Adler of \"The New York Times\" observed, \"A lot of the sets are lovely, Daniel Massey acts beautifully as a kind of warmed NÃ¶el Coward, and the film, which gets richer and better as it goes along, has a nice scene from \"Private Lives\". People who like old-style musicals should get their money\\'s worth. So should people who like Julie Andrews. But people who liked Gertrude Lawrence had better stick with their record collections and memories.\"\\n\\n\"Variety\" said, \"Julie Andrews\\' portrayal . . . occasionally sags between musical numbers but the cast and team of redoubtable technical contributors have helped to turn out a pleasing tribute to one of the theatre\\'s most admired stars. It gives a fascinating coverage of Lawrence\\'s spectacular rise to showbiz fame, and also a neatly observed background of an epoch now gone.\"\\n\\n\"Time Out London\" says, \"Wise\\'s biopic hardly deserved the rough treatment it received from most critics and audiences, who had been led by the studio\\'s advertising to expect another \"Sound of Music\". This was a far more ambitious project; it backfired, but it backfired with a certain amount of honour. Daniel Massey\\'s mincing portrayal of his godfather NoÃ«l Coward wins hands down over all the other impersonations.\"\\n\\n\"TV Guide\" thought \"it deserved a better fate for its enormous score, top-flight production, excellent choreography, and fine acting\".\\n\\nKevin Thomas of the \"Los Angeles Times\" described the film as \"stylish, sharp-edged, and underrated\".\\n\\nSection::::Awards and nominations.\\nSection::::Academy Awards.\\nThe film was nominated for seven Academy Awards, winning none:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Television and home video.\\nThe film debuted on American television in a truncated form, but with its original title. Within a week, it was broadcast in the United Kingdom at its original length, with only the overture and entr\\'acte eliminated.\\n\\nOne unusual feature about the uncut original version of the film was that, like many released today, it had no opening credits. The only credits seen at the beginning were fictitious â those of the newsreel film within the film â about Gertrude Lawrence, which, after an onscreen overture, is the first thing the audience viewing the film sees. The Twentieth Century-Fox logo was seen only as part of that newsreel, not as part of the actual film, and appeared only in black-and-white. Director Robert Wise had to obtain special permission for putting the main title credits at the end of the film. Initially there were no cast of characters credits which would typically come at the end because (like \"Fantasia\" and \"Apocalypse Now\") a special program was to be given to the audience. However at the last minute, a cast of characters roll was added. Because of its late inclusion, it was not scored, a detail that was corrected for the first laserdisc and VHS release after consulting with the producer and director. The music used came from the instrumental bridge and second verse of the title song as originally released on a 45RPM single record.\\n\\nAfter the complete version had been unseen and thought lost for nearly 20 years, the rental library Films, Inc. had a new 35mm mono print struck in the late 80s. Numerous screenings on the revival theatre circuit, a two-part article in a movie collector newspaper, and a worldwide letter writing campaign by fans, were followed by an article in Premiere Magazine, an acclaimed debut of the complete version on US cable TV, and a long-awaited release on home video. All this attention has earned \"Star!\" a reputation as an underrated \"lost classic\" and a cult favorite.\\n\\nAfter being transferred to video with the director\\'s supervision in 1993, a new 35mm print was struck for the 25th Anniversary screening in November at the Directors Guild of America Theatre in Hollywood, CA. This print carried the new Dolby Stereo soundtrack created for the video and laserdisc, which mixed down from the original six channel magnetic soundtrack (Screen Left, Left Center, Center, Right Center, Screen Right and Audience Surround) to four channels (Screen Left, Center, Screen Right, and Audience Surround). The gala screening reunited many cast members with the Director Robert Wise, Producer Saul Chaplin, Choreographer Michael Kidd, Dance Assistant Shelah Hackett Kidd, and Julie Andrews, who was welcomed by a standing ovation from a packed house.\\n\\nWhile the initial US video release (on VHS and Laserdisc) featured a transfer of the entire 176 minute film (from the original 65mm camera negative and six-channel magnetic soundtrack), the DVD, mastered from 35mm elements, runs only 173 minutes, because Fox cut the intermission/entr\\'acte sequence. The laserdisc received a very favorable review from Laserdisc Newsletter, however fans have since written in online reviews and home theatre forums criticizing the DVD for, among other things, loss of the intermission/entr\\'acte, inaccurate framing, sound mix, and color (particularly the sepia tint the DVD added to the B&W sequences not being the original filmmakers\\' choice). Long after laserdiscs stopped being a current format, fans have stated in some forums that they still preferred to watch the laserdisc rather than the DVD.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Star!

They went on hiatus in 2002 and reunited in 2013.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Formation.\\nThe Gathering Field legacy began in a burned-out third floor in Grove City, Pennsylvania, when Bill Deasy, Dave Brown and Rusted Root percussionist Jim DiSpirito \"isolated themselves for the weekend with guitars, tequila, microphones and recording gear\". An obscure, rare recording was born out of that weekend, appropriately titled \"The Lost Weekend\", which was never made commercially available.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nThe Gathering Field line-up ultimately became Deasy on vocals and acoustic guitar, Brown on lead guitar, Eric Riebling on bass and Ray DeFade as drummer. Their first independent release, the self-titled \"The Gathering Field\", was met with great reception around the region and they started playing to packed clubs. However, the band\\'s popularity really skyrocketed when one of the region\\'s most powerful rock radio stations, WDVE, began playing a song called, \"Lost in America\". The song remained in rotation for over seven months. Based on the success of the self-titled CD, the group garnered a major label deal with Atlantic Records, who re-released their album.\\n\\nSoon after they signed to Atlantic Records and \"Lost in America\" was re-released, there was turmoil at the label. The album charted on the \"Billboard\" Top 100 album chart, Radio and Records and various other industry publications but ultimately the CD and group got lost in the shuffle and they attempted to be released from their contract. DeFade left the group and was replaced with Joe Zelek. When they finally succeeded, they released two more CDs; \"Reliance\" and \"So Close to Home,\" the latter consisting of songs the band had played live for several years but never recorded. During that time Deasy also released a semi-acoustic solo album called \"Spring Lies Waiting\", produced by Brown.\\n\\nSection::::Hiatus.\\nRefusing to use the words \"break-up\" when describing their status, The Gathering Field went on an \"infinite hiatus\" in 2002. \\n\\nDeasy now records as a solo artist and continues to be a prolific songwriter. His song \"Good Things Are Happening\" was the theme for ABC\\'s \"Good Morning America\" from 2001 to 2004. Since his departure from The Gathering Field, he has recorded with artists such as Bob Dylan, Bruce Springsteen, John Mellencamp and Patty Griffin. His music has been recorded by Martina McBride, Billy Ray Cyrus, Howard Jones, Kim Richey and The Clarks.\\n\\nZelek formed the Joe Zelek Band. They had their music used by television stations such as WTOV in Steubenville, Ohio, WFTV in Orlando, Florida, and Fox Sports West in Los Angeles, California. The band has also played the main stage at the Jamboree in the Hills since 2007.\\n\\nRiebling continues to record music, and has emerged as a web designer for several artists and groups that he has been associated with.\\n\\nSection::::Reunion.\\nIn November 2013, Bill Deasy announced during an interview on WYEP that the Gathering Field was reuniting and would immediately begin playing live shows again.

He was Ligue 1 Player of the Year in 1996, Serie A Footballer of the Year in 2001, and La Liga Best Foreign Player in 2002. In 2004, he was named in the FIFA 100, a list of the world\\'s greatest living players compiled by PelÃ©, and in the same year was named the best European footballer of the past 50 years in the UEFA Golden Jubilee Poll. Zidane is one of eight players to have won the FIFA World Cup, the UEFA Champions League and the Ballon d\\'Or, and was the ambassador for Qatar\\'s successful bid to stage the 2022 FIFA World Cup, the first Arab country to host the tournament.\\n\\nAfter retiring as a player, Zidane transitioned into coaching, and began as his head coaching career at Real Madrid Castilla. He remained in the position for two years before taking the helm of the first team in January 2016. In his two and a half seasons with Madrid, Zidane won the UEFA Champions League an unprecedented three times consecutively, a La Liga title, a Supercopa de EspaÃ±a, and the UEFA Super Cup and FIFA Club World Cup twice each. His success saw him named Best FIFA Men\\'s Coach in 2017, but he resigned in May 2018. Following poor results by Real Madrid in the subsequent months, Zidane returned to the club as manager in March 2019.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and career.\\nZinedine Yazid Zidane was born on 23 June 1972 in La Castellane, Marseille, in Southern France. He is the youngest of five siblings. Zidane is of Algerian Kabyle descent. His parents, SmaÃ¯l and Malika, emigrated to Paris from the village of Aguemoune in the Berber-speaking region of Kabylie in northern Algeria in 1953 before the start of the Algerian War. The family, which had settled in the city\\'s tough northern districts of BarbÃ¨s and Saint-Denis, found little work in the region, and in the mid-1960s moved to the northern Marseille suburb of La Castellane in the 16th arrondissement of Marseille.\\n\\nHis father worked as a warehouseman and nightwatchman at a department store, often on the night shift, while his mother was a housewife. The family lived a reasonably comfortable life by the standards of the neighbourhood, which was notorious throughout Marseille for its high crime and unemployment rates. Zidane credits his strict upbringing and his father as the \"guiding light\" in his career.\\n\\nIt was in Castellane where Zidane had his earliest introduction in football, joining in at the age of five in football games that the neighbourhood\\'s children played on the Place Tartane, an 80-by-12-yard plaza that served as the main square of the housing complex. In July 2011, Zidane named former Marseille players BlaÅ¾ SliÅ¡koviÄ, Enzo Francescoli and Jean-Pierre Papin as his idols while growing up. At the age of ten, Zidane got his first player\\'s licence after joining the junior team of a local club from Castellane by the name of US Saint-Henri. After spending a year and a half at US Saint-Henri, Zidane joined SO SeptÃ¨mes-les-Vallons when the SeptÃ¨mes coach Robert Centenero convinced the club\\'s Director to get Zidane. Zidane stayed with SeptÃ¨mes until the age of 14, at which time he was selected to attend a three-day training camp at the CREPS (Regional Centre for Sports and Physical Education) in Aix-en-Provence, one of several such footballing institutes run by the French Football Federation. It was here that Zidane was spotted by AS Cannes scout and former player Jean Varraud, who recommended him to the training centre director of the club. As a 14 year old watching the 1986 World Cup, the performance of Diego Maradona left an indelible mark on him, with Zidane stating Maradona \"was on another level\".\\n\\nSection::::Club career.\\nSection::::Cannes.\\nZidane went to AS Cannes for a six-week stay, but ended up remaining at the club for four years to play at the professional level. Having left his family to join Cannes, he was invited by Cannes Director Jean-Claude Elineau to leave the dormitory he shared with 20 other trainees and to come and stay with him and his family. Zidane later said that while living with the Elineaus he found equilibrium.\\n\\nIt was at Cannes where Zidane\\'s first coaches noticed that he was raw and sensitive, prone to attack spectators who insulted his race or family. His first coach, Jean Varraud, encouraged him to channel his anger and focus on his own game. Zidane spent his first weeks at Cannes mainly on cleaning duty as a punishment for punching an opponent who mocked his ghetto origins. The occasional violence that he would display throughout his career was shaped by an internal conflict of being an Algerian-Frenchman suspended between cultures, and surviving the tough streets of La Castellane where he grew up.\\n\\nZidane made his professional debut with Cannes on 18 May 1989 in a French Division 1 match against Nantes. He scored his first goal for the club on 10 February 1991 also against Nantes in a 2â1 win. After the match during a party for all the Cannes players, Zidane was given a car by Cannes chairman Alain Pedretti, who had promised him one the day he scored his first goal for the club. On the pitch, Zidane displayed extraordinary technique on the ball, offering glimpses of the talent that would take him to the top of the world game. In his first full season with Cannes, the club secured its first ever European football berth by qualifying for the UEFA Cup after finishing fourth in the league. This remains the club\\'s highest finish in the top flight since getting relegated for the first time from the first division in the 1948â49 season.\\n\\nSection::::Bordeaux.\\nZidane was transferred to Girondins de Bordeaux in the 1992â93 season, winning the 1995 Intertoto Cup after beating Karlsruhe, and finishing runner-up against Bayern Munich in the 1995â96 UEFA Cup, in four years with the club. He played a set of midfield combinations with Bixente Lizarazu and Christophe Dugarry, which would become the trademark of both Bordeaux and the 1998 French national team. In 1995, Blackburn Rovers manager Kenny Dalglish had expressed interest in signing both Zidane and Dugarry, to which club owner Jack Walker reportedly replied, \"Why do you want to sign Zidane when we have Tim Sherwood?\" Also towards the beginning of the 1996 season, according to football agent Barry Silkman, Zidane was offered to Newcastle United for Â£1.2\\xa0million, but the club turned down the offer after watching him, claiming that he was not good enough for the English First Division. In 1996, Zidane received the award for Ligue 1 Player of the Year.\\n\\nSection::::Juventus.\\nAfter a series of stand out performances for both Bordeaux and France, Zidane had offers to join Europe\\'s top clubs in the spring of 1996, deciding on a move to UEFA Champions League winners Juventus during the close season. Zidane\\'s impact in Italy was immediate, winning the 1996â97 Serie A title and the 1996 Intercontinental Cup. He was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year in his first season. Zidane\\'s growing status in the sport saw him chosen in a European XI to face a World XI â featuring a forward line of Ronaldo and Gabriel Batistuta â in December 1997.\\n\\nAs the playmaker at Juve, Zidane played just behind forward Alessandro Del Piero, with Del Piero recalling, \"Zidane had an extraordinary talent, which contributed to his sole interest in helping the team. He was not a selfish player. He had a unique ability to be a great and to be a team player. I was lucky to play with him.\" He lost in the 1997 UEFA Champions League Final 3â1 to Borussia Dortmund when he was unable to make an impression against the close marking of Paul Lambert.\\n\\nThe following season, Zidane scored seven goals in 32 matches in the league to help Juventus win the 1997â98 Serie A and thus retain the \"Scudetto\". In Europe, Juventus made their third consecutive UEFA Champions League Final appearance, but lost the game 1â0 to Real Madrid. In 1998, Zidane was named FIFA World Player of the Year, and won the Ballon d\\'Or. Juventus finished second in the 2000â01 Serie A, but were eliminated in the group stage of the Champions League, after Zidane was banned for head-butting Hamburger SV player Jochen Kientz. In 2001, Zidane was named Serie A Foreign Footballer of the Year for the second time.\\n\\nSection::::Real Madrid.\\nIn 2001, Zidane joined Real Madrid for a world record fee of 150\\xa0billion Italian lire, (about â¬77.5\\xa0million by fixed exchange rate; a reported 12.8\\xa0billion pesetas) in instalments, and signed a four-year contract. The latest addition to the \"GalÃ¡cticos\" era of global stars signed by Real Madrid every year, in his first season at the club Zidane scored a famous match-winning goal, a volley hit with his weaker foot, in Madrid\\'s 2â1 win over Bayer Leverkusen in the 2002 UEFA Champions League Final, completing his personal quadruple. The goal has been cited as one of the greatest in Champions League history. The magnitude of the strike saw Zidane produce one of his most emotional goal celebrations as he ran towards the touchline with mouth wide open, screaming in delight.\\nThe next season, Zidane helped Real Madrid to win the 2002â03 La Liga, starring alongside LuÃ­s Figo in midfield, and was named the FIFA World Player of the Year for the third time. In 2004, fans voted him as the best European footballer of the previous 50 years in UEFA\\'s fiftieth-anniversary Golden Jubilee Poll.\\n\\nWhile Zidane\\'s final season of club football ended without a trophy, he enjoyed success on a personal note by scoring his first hat-trick, against Sevilla, in a 4â2 win in January 2006. He ended the season for Real Madrid as their second highest goalscorer and assists provider behind teammates Ronaldo and David Beckham respectively, with nine goals and ten assists in 28 games. On 7 May 2006, Zidane, who had announced his plans to retire after the 2006 World Cup, played his farewell match and scored in a 3â3 draw with Villarreal. The squad wore commemorative shirts with \"ZIDANE 2001â2006\" below the club logo. The 80,000 fans inside the Santiago BernabÃ©u held up a banner reading, \"Thanks for the magic.\"\\n\\nIn 2012, Zidane featured for Madrid in an All Stars Match against Manchester United which resulted in a 3â2 win for Real. In April 2013, he was named by \"Marca\" as a member of the \"Best foreign eleven in Real Madrid\\'s history.\"\\n\\nSection::::International career.\\nBoth France and Algeria consider Zidane a citizen. It was rumoured that coach Abdelhamid Kermali denied Zidane a position for the Algerian squad because he felt the young midfielder was not fast enough. However, Zidane dismissed the rumour in a 2005 interview, saying that he would have been ineligible to play for Algeria because he had already played for France.\\n\\nZidane was a member of the French under-21 squad that won a bronze medal at the 1993 Mediterranean Games in Languedoc-Roussillon.\\nHe earned his first cap with France as a substitute in a friendly against the Czech Republic on 17 August 1994, which ended in a 2â2 draw after Zidane scored twice to help France erase a 2â0 deficit. After Eric Cantona was handed a year-long suspension in January 1995 for assaulting a fan, Zidane took over the playmaker position.\\n\\nSection::::Euro 1996.\\nDespite not being at his best during the tournament, France reached the last four. Zidane was not yet fully established in the French team and his level was quite average during the whole event, but he managed to score in the penalty shootout in both the quarter-final and semi-final. France was eliminated in the Euro 96 semi-finals in a penalty shootout against the Czech Republic.\\n\\nSection::::1998 World Cup.\\nThe 1998 FIFA World Cup was the first World Cup that Zidane participated in. It was held in his home country France. The French team won all three games in the group stage but Zidane was sent off in the second match against Saudi Arabia for a stamp on Fuad Anwar, becoming the first French player to receive a red card in a World Cup Finals match. Without their playmaker France proceeded to win 1â0 in the round of sixteen game against Paraguay and, on his return to the side, defeated Italy 4â3 on penalties after a goalless draw in the quarter-finals. France then defeated Croatia 2â1 in the semi-final. Zidane played a major role in the team\\'s accomplishment, though he had yet to score a goal at the World Cup.\\n\\nZidane and France went on to play against defending champions and favourites Brazil at the Stade de France in the 1998 FIFA World Cup Final. France dominated Brazil from the kick-off, with Zidane scoring two similar goals, both headers from corner kicks taken by Emmanuel Petit and Youri Djorkaeff. Courtesy of Zidane\\'s two goals, France went into the half-time break 2â0 up with one hand on the World Cup trophy. Petit added a third goal deep in stoppage time to seal the 3â0 win and France\\'s first ever World Cup. Named man of the match, Zidane became an instant national hero and would receive the LÃ©gion d\\'honneur later that year. More than one million people lined the Champs-ÃlysÃ©es in Paris, with celebrations centred around the Arc de Triomphe.\\n\\nSection::::Euro 2000.\\nTwo years later France won Euro 2000, becoming the first team to hold both the World Cup and the European Championship since West Germany in 1974. Zidane finished with two goals, a bending free kick against Spain in the quarter-final and the golden goal in the semi-final against Portugal with a penalty. UEFA named Zidane Player of the Tournament.\\n\\nZidane himself believes he was at his peak during the tournament, while the UEFA website states, \"In Belgium and the Netherlands, Zidane dominated a major championship in a way no individual had managed since Diego Maradona in 1986. From the opening game against Denmark to the final against Italy, \\'Zizou\\' shone brightly, casting a spell on his opponents with clever flicks, mesmerising stepovers, slaloming runs and masterful vision.\"\\n\\nSection::::2002 World Cup.\\nAs reigning world and European champions, France entered the 2002 World Cup in Japan/Korea as favourites but a thigh injury sustained in a warm up match before the tournament prevented Zidane from playing in France\\'s first two matches and without their talisman, the French team failed to score in either match. He was rushed back prematurely for the third game despite not being fully fit, but could not prevent France from being ignominiously eliminated in the group stage without scoring a single goal; the worst performance by a defending champion in the history of the competition.\\n\\nSection::::Euro 2004.\\nAt Euro 2004, France topped their group with wins over England and Switzerland, before being knocked out in the quarter finals by eventual champions Greece in a surprise 1â0 loss. In the opening match against England, Zidane scored a free kick and penalty in stoppage time to turn impending defeat into a 2â1 victory. After France\\'s elimination, Zidane announced his retirement from international football.\\n\\nSection::::2006 World Cup.\\nWith the mass retirement of veteran key players such as Bixente Lizarazu, Marcel Desailly, Claude Makelele and Lilian Thuram, France struggled to qualify for the 2006 World Cup. At the urging of coach Raymond Domenech, Zidane came out of retirement and was immediately reinstated as team captain. Zidane, along with Thuram and Makelele, made his competitive return for France in a 3â0 win over the Faroe Islands on 3 September 2005. The trio helped France rise from fourth place to win their qualifying group. On 27 May 2006, Zidane earned his hundredth cap for France in a 1â0 friendly win over Mexico, in what would also be his last match at the Stade de France. Zidane became France\\'s fourth player to reach 100 caps, after Desailly, Thuram and Didier Deschamps.\\n\\nFrance had a slow start to the 2006 Finals and, after being suspended for the third match of the group stage, Zidane returned to set up a goal for Patrick Vieira and score one himself in the second round match against Spain. In the quarter-final France held Brazil to just one shot on goal in the rematch of the 1998 final. Zidane assisted Thierry Henry\\'s deciding goal and was named Man of the Match by FIFA. France faced Portugal in the semi-final and, as in Brussels six years earlier, Zidane\\'s penalty kick decided the contest and sent France to another major final.\\n\\nBefore the 2006 World Cup final in Berlin, Zidane was awarded the Golden Ball as the player of the tournament. Having already announced he was to retire after the expiration of his Real Madrid contract at the end of the 2005â06 season, the world of football already knew Zidane\\'s second World Cup final was to be the last match of his career. Seven minutes into the match Zidane put France ahead with a Panenka-style penalty kick which struck the crossbar and bounced just over the goal line to become only the fourth player in World Cup history to score in two different finals, along with PelÃ©, Paul Breitner, and VavÃ¡, in addition to being tied for first place with VavÃ¡, PelÃ© and Geoff Hurst with three World Cup final goals apiece. He almost scored a second goal during the first period of extra time but his header was saved by Italy\\'s goalkeeper Gianluigi Buffon. Zidane was then sent off in the 110th minute of the game after headbutting Marco Materazzi in the chest, so he did not participate in the penalty shootout which Italy won 5â3. Zidane\\'s actions made headlines all over the world, while in France \"Le Figaro\" called his head-butt \"odious,\" and the front page of \"L\\'Equipe\" asked, \"What should we tell our children, for whom you have become an example for ever? ... How could that happen to a man like you?\"\\n\\nUpon his return to France, the Place de la Concorde in Paris was filled with thousands of fans waving flags and rhythmically chanting \"Zizou! Zizou!,\" and tributes were led by the French president Jacques Chirac. Chirac\\'s words reflected the feeling of the French public, with polls done in the immediate wake of the incident showing support for Zidane: 61% of French people said they had already forgiven him for his actions while 52% said they understood them. According to French journalist Philippe Auclair, Zidane\\'s performances in the knock-out rounds were \"ranked among his finest in a blue shirt.\" As the player of the tournament, Zidane had given the team hope, with the French daily newspaper \"LibÃ©ration\" stating, \"For a month, France was dreaming with Zidane.\" Zidane remained an icon to the French public, and one French writer stated, \"It\\'s good for us to see our national hero is fallible.\" It was later revealed through interviews that Marco Materazzi had insulted Zidane\\'s sister, which led to Zidane\\'s heightened anger and reaction. In 2010, Zidane said that he would \"rather die than apologize\" to Materazzi for the headbutt in the final, but also admitted that he \"could never have lived with himself\" had he been allowed to remain on the pitch and help France win the match. He later said, \"If you look at the fourteen red cards I had in my career, twelve of them were a result of provocation. This isn\\'t justification, this isn\\'t an excuse, but my passion, temper and blood made me react.\"\\n\\nFollowing his red card in the final, Zidane retired from professional football and confirmed that he would not go back on his decision. He was sentenced by FIFA to a three match suspension for the red card. He agreed to complete three days of community service with children in one of FIFA\\'s humanitarian projects. Zidane ended up tying with Brazil\\'s Cafu for the record for most cards given in World Cup matches, with six.\\n\\nSection::::Retirement.\\nSince his retirement, Zidane has regularly played for the Real Madrid Veterans team. He has also made several futsal appearances. In 2015 he played in a futsal tournament in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, during which an opposition player received a yellow card to much amusement for taking an in-match selfie with Zidane. In an interview in June 2008, Zidane stated that he wanted to return to football, but that he had no immediate plans to do so.\\n\\nOn 1 June 2009, Zidane was announced as the advisor to the president after Florentino PÃ©rez was named president of Real Madrid for the second time. He, along with general director Jorge Valdano and sporting director Miguel Pardeza, were to be the key decisionmakers on the sporting side of the club. After France\\'s dismal campaign in the 2010 World Cup, Zidane said that he did not plan to move into coaching any time soon.\\n\\nQatar\\'s 2022 World Cup bid committee announced in September 2010 that Zidane had been appointed as an ambassador for Qatar\\'s attempt to host the 2022 World Cup. After FIFA announced on 2 December 2010 that Qatar had won the bid to host the 2022 World Cup, Zidane stated that he was \"very pleased\" with the outcome. Zidane spoke of the message he was trying to convey in the campaign: \"I was saying that football belonged to the whole world. Iâm proud to have made my contribution to a new country getting the World Cup. Qatar and the entire Middle East as a whole deserves this event and that makes me happy. It\\'s a victory for the Arab world.\" Zidane has supported two Olympic bids for Paris, including the 2012 Summer Olympics which was narrowly won by London and later Paris\\' successful bid for the 2024 Summer Olympics. Paris will also be hosting the 2024 Summer Paralympics.\\n\\nSection::::Charity activities.\\nOn 24 February 2007, before a crowd of 10,000 fans at a match in northern Thailand for the Keuydaroon children\\'s AIDS charity, Zidane scored the first goal and set up the second for a Malaysian teammate as the match ended 2â2. The event raised à¸¿260,000 ($7,750). This money paid for the building of two schools and 16 three-bedroom houses.\\n\\nOn 19 November 2008, Zidane took part in the fifth annual Match Against Poverty in MÃ¡laga, Spain, which also ended in a 2â2 draw; he went scoreless but set up his team\\'s second goal. He and Ronaldo, who collaborated in conceiving the yearly event to benefit the United Nations Development Programme, regularly captain their respective teams consisting of active footballers, other professional athletes and celebrities. Zidane, a UN Goodwill Ambassador since 2001, stated before the game that \"everyone can do something to make the world a better place.\"\\n\\nIn June and July 2009, Zidane toured across Canada with stops in Toronto, Montreal and Vancouver. Although billed as Zidane and \"Friends\", the likes of which included Fabien Barthez and Samuel Eto\\'o, the exhibition matches featured local players. Some proceeds were given to UNICEF.\\n\\nOn 6 June 2010, Zidane took part in the biennial charity event Soccer Aid. He played for the Rest of the World team, managed by former Liverpool and Celtic forward Kenny Dalglish against England alongside former Real Madrid teammate LuÃ­s Figo and Celtic legend Henrik Larsson. He played against former players such as Teddy Sheringham and Alan Shearer, as well as celebrities such as Hollywood actors Woody Harrelson, Mike Myers, Michael Sheen, chef Gordon Ramsay, actor Damian Lewis and singer Robbie Williams. The match took place at Old Trafford, Manchester and was won by the Rest of the World for the first time, the winning penalty scored by Harrelson after a 2â2 draw.\\n\\nOn 2 June 2013, Zidane took part in a charity match played at Old Trafford as part of the Manchester United Legends vs. Real Madrid Legends reverse fixture. The first leg took place in Santiago BernabÃ©u Stadium. Part of a team that included the likes of Figo, Fernando Redondo and Manolo SanchÃ­s, the fixture raised funds for the Manchester United Foundation. The 12th Match against Poverty took place in Saint-Ãtienne, France on Monday 20 April 2015, where Ronaldo and Zidane teamed up with other football stars against past and present players of French Ligue 1 club AS Saint-Ãtienne. According to UNDP, \"two-thirds of all proceeds will go towards helping the hardest-hit countries of Guinea, Liberia and Sierra Leone build back better from the Ebola epidemic.\" In June 2018, Zidane reunited with his France 1998 World Cup winning teammates to play a charity game against an All-Star side which included Jamaican sprinter Usain Bolt. In a 3â2 win for France, Thierry Henry played a no-look one-two pass with Zidane before scoring, with Zidane then curling in a 25-yard free kick.\\n\\nSection::::Managerial career.\\nIn November 2010, Zidane was appointed as a special adviser to Real Madrid\\'s first team in response to an appeal made by then-Real Madrid coach JosÃ© Mourinho for the former Real midfielder to work more closely with the team. In his new role, Zidane was expected to participate in Champions League events and functions and was also to travel with the first team on a regular basis and participate in pre-match gatherings, training sessions and meetings with the head coach. In July 2011, it was announced that he would become Real Madrid\\'s new sporting director. In 2013, Zidane was appointed assistant coach to Carlo Ancelotti at Real Madrid.\\n\\nSection::::Real Madrid Castilla.\\nIn June 2014, Real Madrid announced that Zidane would be the coach of Real Madrid\\'s B team, Real Madrid Castilla. On 29 August, the director of the Spanish National Football Coach Education Centre (CENAFE), Miguel GalÃ¡n, reported Zidane for acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach without the necessary coaching badges. According to GalÃ¡n, \"No one who has anything to do with the football world can be unaware that Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach this season. It is a fait accompli that has been widely accepted, as shown by media reports, and Real Madrid do not deny it.\" While the official match report for Castilla\\'s opening game in the Segunda DivisiÃ³n B lists Santiago SÃ¡nchez as the \"Los Blancos\"\\' head coach and Zidane as his assistant, GalÃ¡n states, \"This hierarchy only exists on paper. The truth is the exact opposite: Zidane is acting as Real Madrid Castilla\\'s head coach, while, with all due respect to him as a colleague, Mr SÃ¡nchez\\'s role basically boils down to providing the badges.\"\\n\\nSection::::Real Madrid.\\nOn 4 January 2016, Real Madrid announced the dismissal of manager Rafael BenÃ­tez and on the same day Zidane was appointed the new manager of the club on a two-and-a-half-year deal. His first match as the club\\'s new manager took place five days later, when Real Madrid beat Deportivo La CoruÃ±a 5â0 in a La Liga match. In his first \"El ClÃ¡sico\" as a manager, held on 2 April at the Camp Nou, Zidane led his club to a 2â1 win over Barcelona to end BarÃ§a\\'s 39-match unbeaten run. Zidane thus became the first Real Madrid manager to win his first \"ClÃ¡sico\" match since Bernd Schuster in December 2007.\\n\\nOn 4 May, Zidane led Real Madrid to a place in the 2016 UEFA Champions League Final by beating Manchester City 1â0 on aggregate. In La Liga, Real Madrid finished runners up, just one point behind Barcelona. In the Champions League final on 28 May, Real Madrid defeated fellow Madrid club AtlÃ©tico Madrid in a penalty shootout to grab the 11th European Cup (\"La UndÃ©cima\") in club history. Zidane became the seventh man to win the European Cup (now UEFA Champions League) as both a player and a manager, the second man (after Miguel MuÃ±oz) to win the trophy with Real Madrid as both a player and a manager, and the first French manager, except the French-Argentinian Helenio Herrera, to win the trophy.\\n\\nIn his first full-season as manager, Real Madrid recorded a club-record 16th consecutive La Liga victory by defeating Espanyol 2â0 away on 18 September 2016, overtaking their previous record of 15 set in 1960â61 and equalling the record of consecutive La Liga wins of Barcelona set in 2010â11. On 18 December, Real Madrid defeated Japanese club Kashima Antlers 4â2 in the final of the 2016 FIFA Club World Cup, with Cristiano Ronaldo scoring a hat-trick.\\n\\nOn 12 January 2017, Madrid\\'s draw against Sevilla FC in the second leg of the Copa del Rey round of 16 saw him win his 40th consecutive match without a loss â creating a new Spanish record, beating Luis Enrique\\'s record of 39 matches undefeated with Barcelona. Zidane later led Madrid to the La Liga title, their 33rd in history, by defeating MÃ¡laga 2â0.\\n\\nOn 3 June 2017, Zidane led Real Madrid to a 4â1 win against Italian side Juventus in the 2017 UEFA Champions League Final at Cardiff to grab the club\\'s 12th European Cup (\"La DuodÃ©cima\"). This victory meant that Madrid were the first ever team to win the Champions League back-to-back, as well as recording Zidane\\'s first double as coach, and the club\\'s first since 1956â57. With Real\\'s Champions League victory, Zidane became only the second manager to win the European Cup in his first two seasons in management, alongside fellow Real Madrid manager JosÃ© Villalonga.\\n\\nHe later won the 2017 UEFA Super Cup 2â1 against Manchester United on 8 August. This meant Zidane was the first manager to win two UEFA Super Cups in a row since Arrigo Sacchi\\'s Milan in 1990. Five days later, Real Madrid beat Barcelona at the Camp Nou 1â3 in the first leg of the 2017 Supercopa de EspaÃ±a. Three days later, Real won the second leg 2â0, 5â1 on aggregate, while ending Barcelona\\'s consecutive scoring record in \"El ClÃ¡sico\". This title tied Zidane with Vicente del Bosque as the third most successful Real Madrid manager with 7 titles, one short of Luis Molowny, but still 7 away from Miguel MuÃ±oz. This also meant, that at the time, Zidane had won as many titles in his managerial position in Real Madrid as games lost during his tenure. Zidane\\'s success saw him named Best FIFA Men\\'s Coach in 2017. In December 2017, Zidane won his eighth trophy as manager when Real defeated GrÃªmio in the 2017 FIFA Club World Cup in the United Arab Emirates. On 26 May, Zidane won the Champions League for the third time in a row, beating Liverpool 3â1 in the final. He became one of three managers, alongside Bob Paisley and Carlo Ancelotti, to win the European Cup three times, while also becoming the first manager to win the trophy in three consecutive seasons.\\n\\nOn 31 May, five days after the Champions League Final, Zidane announced his resignation as Real Madrid manager, citing the club\\'s \"need for change\" as his rationale for departing.\\n\\nSection::::Return to Real Madrid.\\nFollowing some poor results for Real Madrid in the months following Zidane\\'s departure â culminating in elimination from the Copa del Rey\\'s semi-final stage at home to Barcelona, a league loss to the same opponent at the same venue which opened up a 12-point gap between the clubs, and an unexpected home 4â1 defeat to Ajax in the Champions League which brought the long run of success in that competition to an end, all within the space of a week â his former teammate Santiago Solari (who himself had only been in the post for five months, after Julen Lopetegui\\'s equally brief spell in charge) was dismissed and Zidane returned as the Real Madrid head coach on 11 March 2019, on a contract until summer 2022.\\n\\nSection::::Reception and legacy.\\nMany authoritative voices have acclaimed Zidane\\'s skills and importance in the history of football, such as Brazil coach Carlos Alberto Parreira, who called Zidane \"a monster\" for his performance and abilities. German coach Franz Beckenbauer stated, \"Zidane is one of the greatest players in history, a truly magnificent player.\" Italy manager Marcello Lippi, who also coached Zidane, opined, \"I think Zidane is the greatest talent we\\'ve known in football these last twenty years.\" Former England manager Kevin Keegan said, \"You look at Zidane and think \\'I\\'ve never seen a player quite like that.\\' What sets Zidane apart is the way he manipulates a football, buying himself space that isn\\'t there. Add his vision and it makes him very special.\" At the 1998 World Cup, Italian manager Cesare Maldini said, \"I would give up five players to have Zidane in my squad.\"\\n\\nAmong his playing peers, Swedish striker Zlatan IbrahimoviÄ commented, \"Zidane was from another planet. When Zidane stepped onto the pitch, the ten other guys just got suddenly better. It is that simple.\" David Beckham has described Zidane as \"the greatest of all time\", Barcelona star Xavi has stated in a 2010 interview that Zidane was \"best player in the \\'90s and early 2000s\", while Brazilian defender and former Madrid teammate Roberto Carlos has said of Zidane, \"He is the best player I\\'ve seen. Supporters arrived earlier at the BernabÃ©u just to see him warm-up.\" Brazilian playmaker Ronaldinho stated, \"Zidane is one of the best footballers of all time, one of my idols. He had such elegance and grace, a wonderful touch and superb vision.\" Belgian playmaker Eden Hazard regards Zidane as \"the best ever\", and growing up he learned from his idol by \"watching him on television and online for hours.\"\\n\\nDisplaying skills with an array of moves such as his signature \"La Roulette\" pirouette, step overs and close ball control, former Brazilian international Rivaldo enjoyed watching Zidane more than any other player, stating, \"His elegance of movement on the pitch and his skills are uncanny.\" Journalist Sid Lowe wrote, \"Zidane was football\\'s answer to the Bolshoi Ballet. Zidane was elegance above all else.\" Spanish midfielder Xabi Alonso opined, \"What he could do with a football is a dream for most of us.\" In 2005, upon Zidane\\'s return to the French national team, his teammate Thierry Henry stated, \"In France, everybody realized that God exists, and that he is back in the French international team.\" Zidane has been lauded by sportsmen outside football; having witnessed Zidane\\'s goal against Deportivo La CoruÃ±a in January 2002, where he dragged the ball right then left, turning the defender inside out, before scoring with a left foot finish, basketball player Magic Johnson stated, \"One of the most inspiring nights of my life. Zidane is a phenomenon.\"\\n\\nZidane has been named FIFA World Player of the Year three times, a feat achieved only by Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Cristiano Ronaldo. In 2002, ESPN described Zidane as \"the greatest player in the world in the world\\'s biggest game\". In a 2002 FIFA poll, Zidane was selected in the FIFA World Cup Dream Team. In 2004, he was voted UEFA Best European Player of the Past 50 Years, and was named in the FIFA 100 list of the world\\'s greatest living players. In 2011, when UEFA polled players, journalists and their users to crown the best player in the UEFA Champions League of the past 20 years, Zidane topped the vote. In a 2004 poll conducted by French newspaper \"Journal du Dimanche\", Zidane was voted as \"the most popular Frenchman of all time\". In 2014, in a poll carried out by French TV channel TF1, Zidane was voted as the best player in the history of the French league. In 2016, in a study led by French newspaper \"Le Parisien\", Zidane was named \"best French player of all time\".\\n\\nSection::::Reception as manager.\\nDespite establishing himself as one of the most successful managers of his era and in the history of Real Madrid, Zidane\\'s time at Real Madrid was considered by some to be shadowed by a partial amount of luck. However, Zidane\\'s tactical philosophy, particularly his tactical flexibility, has been praised by many. His use of in-game substitutions was particularly praised, as many of his substitutes led to victories, such as introducing Marco Asensio and Lucas VÃ¡zquez in order to provide pace and width against Paris Saint-Germain in the UEFA Champions League to overturn a 1â0 deficit into a 3â1 victory. His introduction of Gareth Bale for similar reasons in the 2018 UEFA Champions League Final also reaped similar rewards. It is also noted that his team focused on attacking through the flanks, while he is credited for popularising the 4â4â2 diamond formation in contemporary football.\\n\\nOn the other hand, some consider that Zidane\\'s role was more focused in grinding out results and uniting the dressing room, rather than having a fixed tactic scheme. Zidane emphasised the importance of players\\' physical levels and preferred to choose impactful players over a defined system.\\n\\nSection::::In popular culture.\\nZidane has had endorsements with many companies, including Adidas, Lego, France Telecom, Orange, Audi, Volvic and Christian Dior. These sponsorship deals earned him â¬8.6\\xa0million on top of his â¬6.4\\xa0million Real Madrid salary in 2006, totalling â¬15\\xa0million ($20.4\\xa0million), which made him the sixth-highest paid footballer. In 2004, \"Forbes\" magazine listed his earnings of $15.8\\xa0million for the previous 12 months. In May 2010, Zidane appeared in a commercial for Louis Vuitton, indulging in a game of table football with PelÃ© and Diego Maradona.\\n\\nIn 2005, filmmakers Philippe Parreno and Douglas Gordon filmed a documentary \"\", which follows Zidane during an entire match, filmed with 17 cameras. Scottish post-rock band Mogwai provided the soundtrack. The documentary was part of the 2009 Full Frame Documentary Film Festival.\\n\\nIn November 2006, Zidane toured Bangladesh as the guest of Nobel Peace Prize winner Muhammad Yunus. He also visited the Algerian birthplace of his parents and met with Algerian president Abdelaziz Bouteflika, who gave him an official reception. In 2012, Algerian artist Adel Abdessemed unveiled a bronze sculpture depicting Zidane\\'s headbutt of Marco Materazzi in the 2006 World Cup Final.\\n\\nOn 5 November 2006, Zidane appeared in the American animated sitcom \"Family Guy\", seen headbutting an old lady in the episode \"Saving Private Brian\" as a parody of his headbutt on Materazzi. The infamous headbutt has also been the subject of a lyrical essay by the Belgian novelist Jean-Philippe Toussaint entitled \"La MÃ©lancolie de Zidane\" (2006).\\n\\nIn 2010, footage of Zidane appeared in the \"Waka Waka\" music video by Shakira, which shows him celebrating France winning the 1998 World Cup. In 2014, Australian sports presenter Les Murray collaborated with the band Vaudeville Smash and performed a Zidane tribute song, the accompanying video featuring four footballers performing ball tricks in Zidane masks, one of whom ends up headbutting a nightwatchman. In 2016, Zidane was ranked one of the 500 most influential Muslims in the world by the Royal Islamic Strategic Studies Centre of Jordan, which noted: \"[Zidane\\'s] modest character has endeared him to the wider public.\"\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nAt the age of 17, Zidane met his future wife, VÃ©ronique FernÃ¡ndez (born in Aveyron of Spanish descent), while playing for Cannes in the 1988â89 season. Married in 1994, they have four sons: Enzo Alan Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 24 March 1995), Luca Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 13 May 1998), Theo Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 18 May 2002), and Elyaz Zidane FernÃ¡ndez (born 26 December 2005).

As other chapels opened, however, there was a gradual decline in attendees and in 1933 the pastorâs salary was reduced by Â£20 to Â£205 (). In 1965 the chapel merged with the Zion Chapel and Rook Lane eventually closed in 1968. It was sold to developers but they were unable to secure planning permission for proposed future uses.

Like most other operators in C++, it can be overloaded.\\n\\nThe copy assignment operator, often just called the \"assignment operator\", is a special case of assignment operator where the source (right-hand side) and destination (left-hand side) are of the same class type. It is one of the special member functions, which means that a default version of it is generated automatically by the compiler if the programmer does not declare one. The default version performs a memberwise copy, where each member is copied by its own copy assignment operator (which may also be programmer-declared or compiler-generated).\\n\\nThe copy assignment operator differs from the copy constructor in that it must clean up the data members of the assignment\\'s target (and correctly handle self-assignment) whereas the copy constructor assigns values to uninitialized data members. For example:\\n\\nSection::::Return value of overloaded assignment operator.\\nThe language permits an overloaded assignment operator to have an arbitrary return type (including codice_2). However, the operator is usually defined to return a reference to the assignee. This is consistent with the behavior of assignment operator for built-in types (returning the assigned value) and allows for using the operator invocation as an expression, for instance in control statements or in chained assignment. Also, the C++ Standard Library requires this behavior for some user-supplied types.\\n\\nSection::::Overloading copy assignment operator.\\nWhen deep copies of objects have to be made, exception safety should be taken into consideration. One way to achieve this when resource deallocation never fails is:\\n\\n\\nHowever, if a no-fail (no-throw) swap function is available for all the member subobjects and the class provides a copy constructor and destructor (which it should do according to the rule of three), the most straightforward way to implement copy assignment is as follows:\\n\\nSection::::Assignment between different classes.\\nC++ supports assignment between different classes, both via implicit copy constructor and assignment operator, if the destination instance class is the ancestor of the source instance class:\\n\\nCopying from ancestor to descendant objects, which could leave descendant\\'s fields uninitialized, is not permitted.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Assignment operator (C++)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7789356'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '3QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7793545', 'text': 'Diane Coyle\\n\\nDiane Coyle, (born February 1961) is an economist and a former advisor to the UK Treasury.

In 1979 the public school board (6 of 7 members of which sent their children to Southland) declared many of the district\\'s buses, books and materials to be \"surplus\", then sold them to Southland at low prices. The effect of this caused financial hardships for the public schools, thereby promoting the academy. The first classes began in the old Anthony School building on Anthony Drive. In 1970, Southland moved to its current location at 123 Southland Road. It was reported in 1979 that most white parents in the area sent their children to Southland rather than the local public school system, which at the time was 80% black and the subject of boycotts and criticism over alleged neglect and underfunding. One businessman said he would \"dig ditches\" to earn money to pay tuition at Southland Academy and avoid sending his children to racially integrated public school.\\n\\nAs of the mid 1980s, the Sumter County School District board was all white.

He was both the first African American and first person from the Deep South to hold the position. A member of the Democratic Party, Espy previously served as the U.S. Representative for Mississippi\\'s 2nd congressional district from 1987 to 1993.\\n\\nIn March 2018, Espy announced his candidacy for the United States Senate seat being vacated by Thad Cochran. Espy finished second in the November 6 nonpartisan special election before facing Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith in a November 27 runoff. Espy was defeated by Hyde-Smith, but garnered more than 46 percent of the vote in what was the closest U.S. Senate election in Mississippi since 1988.\\n\\nOn November 30, 2018, Espy filed to run against Hyde-Smith again in a 2020 rematch for a full six-year Senate term. \\n\\nSection::::Early life and education.\\nEspy was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi. He is the grandson of Thomas J. Huddleston Sr., founder of the Afro-American Sons and Daughters, a fraternal society that operated the Afro-American Hospital, a leading provider of health care for blacks in the state from the 1920s to the 1970s. Espy attended Howard University in Washington, D.C., and was active in student politics, holding several elective positions. He earned his Juris Doctor from Santa Clara University School of Law in California in 1978.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSection::::Early years.\\nEspy was an attorney with Central Mississippi Legal Services between 1978 and 1980 and was later the Assistant Secretary of State to Mississippi Legal Services. From 1980 to 1984, he was the Assistant Secretary of the State to the Public Lands Division.\\n\\nEspy was an Assistant State Attorney General from 1984 to 1985.\\n\\nSection::::Congress and Secretary of Agriculture.\\nIn November 1986, Espy was elected as a Democrat to the 100th Congress from . He defeated two-term Republican Webb Franklin to become the first African-American to represent Mississippi at the federal level since Reconstruction. He was reelected three times.\\n\\nIn December 1992, Espy was chosen by President-elect Bill Clinton to be the Secretary of Agriculture in the new administration. Following his confirmation by the Senate in late January 1993, Espy resigned from his seat in the House of Representatives.\\n\\nEspy served as Secretary of Agriculture from 1993 to 1994. He announced his resignation in October 1994, following questions from the White House over his use of government perks and acceptance of gifts. He was indicted in 1997 for receiving improper gifts, but acquitted of all 30 charges in 1998.\\n\\nIn October 2007, Espy crossed party lines to endorse Republican Mississippi Governor Haley Barbour\\'s reelection campaign.\\n\\nSection::::Private law career.\\nIn 2008, Espy became an attorney at Morgan & Morgan, a nationwide law firm, where he handles general plaintiff\\'s law, mass tort, bond and governmental finance, and international relations cases. One of his notable cases was the Pigford lawsuit, where Espy worked in conjunction with a black farmers advocacy group, the National Black Farmers Association, to represent those farmers.\\n\\nSection::::Senate campaigns.\\nSection::::2018.\\nOn March 5, 2018, Republican Senator Thad Cochran announced he would resign as of April 1 for health reasons, triggering a special election. Espy announced his intention to run for the seat that same day, becoming the first declared candidate in the race. He called Cochran \"a person I admire and respect, and who has done so much for Mississippi over his tenure.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, CBS described Espy as a conservative Democrat. He has identified his positions as moderate, making a centrist pitch for his Senate campaign. \"The Clarion Ledger\" wrote that Espy sought to \"play up his bipartisan credentials, like endorsing former Republican Gov. Haley Barbour. Steer the conversation away from anything controversial, even race, and back to health care.\" When asked by MSNBC\\'s Chris Matthews to comment on President Trump\\'s criticism of several African-American journalists, Espy \"refused to bite\", instead redirecting the interview to health care.\\n\\nA nonpartisan special election took place on November 6, 2018, the same day as the regularly scheduled U.S. Senate election for the seat held by Roger Wicker, who was running for reelection. Party affiliations were not printed on the ballot. After no candidate gained a simple majority of the vote, a runoff election between Espy and Republican Cindy Hyde-Smith was held on November 27. Espy lost the runoff with 46% of the vote.\\n\\nSection::::2020.\\nThree days after losing the Senate special election runoff to Hyde-Smith, on November 30, 2018, his 65th birthday, Espy filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) to run for the seat again in 2020.\\n\\nSection::::Political positions.\\nSection::::Economy.\\n\"National Journal\" noted that his liberal social views are mixed with his support for cutting the federal budget and protecting Mississippi\\'s defense and agricultural industries. In 2018, Espy said that he wanted to cut the government\\'s budget and that he supports free trade. He said he probably would have voted for the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 but that he wants to \"make sure people see the benefits\".\\n\\nSection::::Guns.\\nHe supports gun ownership and received the National Rifle Association\\'s (NRA) Silver Rifle award in 1988 for supporting its positions on gun laws. In 2018, the NRA endorsed Espy\\'s opponent, Cindy Hyde-Smith, for the U.S. Senate, and did not give Espy a rating.\\n\\nSection::::Health care.\\nEspy believes that the decision by Republicans to deny an expansion of Medicaid is why so many rural hospitals in Mississippi have closed.\\n\\nSection::::Immigration.\\nEspy opposes a border wall, citing cost concerns. He opposes the Trump administration\\'s family separation policy.\\n\\nSection::::Social issues.\\nIn 1986, running for Congress, Espy was considered pro-choice on abortion. In 2018, he said he was moderate on abortion; he supports \"Roe v. Wade\" but opposes abortion personally. Espy said during his Senate campaign that he would work with anyone regardless of race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, or disability.\\n\\nSection::::Corruption trial and acquittal.\\nSection::::Espy trial.\\nOn August 27, 1997, Espy was indicted on charges of receiving improper gifts, including sports tickets, lodging, and airfare. Espy refused to plea bargain and on December 2, 1998, he was acquitted of all 30 criminal charges in the trial. Independent Counsel Donald Smaltz presented more than 70 witnesses during the trial and spent more than $20\\xa0million preparing and trying the case.\\n\\nDuring testimony before the jury, the prosecution\\'s star witness told Smaltz: \"God knows, if I had $30\\xa0million, I could find dirt on you, sir.\" During the trial, Smaltz protested that the defense was injecting race into the trial in what he saw as an appeal to a mostly black jury.\\n\\nThe defense rested without calling any witnesses, arguing simply that the prosecution had not proved its case. The jury deliberated less than 10 hours before finding Espy not guilty on all charges. One of the jurors said, \"This was the weakest, most bogus thing I ever saw. I can\\'t believe Mr. Smaltz ever brought this to trial.\" At least four other jurors echoed this view, though less pointedly. Barbara Bisoni, the only white juror, said Smaltz\\'s case \"had holes\" and that race never entered into the deliberations.\\n\\nSection::::Related cases.\\nIn 1996, Sun-Diamond Growers was fined $1.5\\xa0million for giving Espy $6,000 in gifts; in March 1998 it won a reversal at the Court of Appeals level. Independent Counsel Smaltz appealed that ruling to the Supreme Court. The Supreme Court affirmed the decision of the Court of Appeals, finding that the gratuities statute requires a link between a gift and an official act. Unable to make such a link, Smaltz dismissed the gratuities charge against Sun-Diamond. The court\\'s unanimous April 1999 opinion, by Justice Antonin Scalia, stated that the prosecutor\\'s interpretation of the law was so broad that even a high school principal could be in legal trouble for giving a souvenir baseball cap to a visiting Secretary of Education. The Sun-Diamond decision played a pivotal role in Espy\\'s later acquittal because Smaltz was unable to link gifts he received to any official act.\\n\\nIn a separate case during the same investigation, Espy\\'s Chief of Staff, Ronald Blackley, was convicted in late 1997 on three counts of making false statements and sentenced to 27 months in prison.\\n\\nControversy also arose in 1994 from a White House discovery that a foundation run by Tyson Foods had given Espy\\'s then girlfriend, Patricia Dempsey, a $1,200 scholarship. Espy and his lawyer admitted that they deceived the White House, which at first accepted Espy\\'s false claim that he was unaware of the scholarship before it was given to Dempsey. Administration officials said that the discovery of this scholarship was what forced Espy to resign as Secretary of Agriculture. In December 1997, Tyson Foods pleaded guilty to felony charges of giving Espy gifts.\\n\\nSection::::Early life, education, and personal life.\\nEspy was born in Yazoo City, Mississippi, on November 30, 1953. He has a twin sister and five older siblings. He graduated from Yazoo City High School, where he served as senior class president. Espy received a B.A. in political science from Howard University and a J.D. from Santa Clara University School of Law. He married Sheila Bell, with whom he had two children before they divorced.

The project was discussed since 1987. The constructed new transmission lines connect 37\\xa0million consumers in Panama, Costa Rica, Honduras, Nicaragua, El Salvador, and Guatemala. It is expected to be completed in April 2013. There is controversy about the benefits and indirect environmental impacts of the project.\\n\\nSection::::Technical description.\\nSIEPAC network includes a 230\\xa0kV transmission line with a capacity of 300\\xa0MW between Guatemala and Panama, as well as improvements to existing systems. At the second stage the capacity will be increased up to 600\\xa0MW. SIEPAC cost about US$320\\xa0million without the proposed interconnections with Mexico (US$ 40M), Belize (US$ 30M) and Panama (US$ 200m). and, back in 2003, was scheduled for completion in 2006.\\n\\nSection::::Expected benefits.\\nProponents of SIEPAC expect that interconnecting the nations' electrical transmission grids will alleviate periodic power shortages in the region, reduce operating costs, optimize shared use of hydroelectric power, create a competitive energy market in the region, and attract foreign investment in power generation and transmission systems. It has been claimed that the cost of energy for consumers could go down as much as 20% from US$0.11 per kWh to US$0.09 per kWh as a result of the project. A feasibility study undertaken in 1995 by Power Technologies Inc. outlined various scenarios for the expansion of power demand and supply in the region and associated investments. The median scenario foresaw that SIEPAC would induce annual investments of US$700m over a 10-year period once the regional electricity market had begun operating.\\n\\nSection::::Ownership and regulation.\\nSIEPAC is owned by a Regional Operations Entity (Empresa Proprietaria de la Red - EPR), created in 1999 with registration in Panama, and comprising the public utilities and transmission companies of the six participating countries (75%) and private capital (25%). In some countries integrated utilities are shareholders - ENEE of Honduras, ICE and CNFL of Costa Rica - while in others shares are held by transmission companies - INDE of Guatemala, ETESA of Panama, and ENTE of Nicaragua. In the case of El Salvador the utility CEL and the transmission company ETESAL own the shares jointly. The private shareholders are Endesa of Spain and ISA from Colombia.\\n\\nThe establishment of a regional electricity regulator has been envisaged. While the IDB had suggested that electricity generating companies should not be allowed to hold shares in the transmission company, this has apparently been accepted by the governments of Central America.\\n\\nThe project is currently managed by a unit under the Central American Electrification Council (Consejo de ElectrificaciÃ³n de AmÃ©rica Central - CEAC).\\n\\nSection::::Financing.\\nThe funding for the project was originally expected to come from the Inter-American Development Bank (IDB), having initially pledged $170 million in hard and soft loans to the six Central American countries, the Spanish government, offering $70 million and the Central American nations. The contributions of the Central American nations had been initially estimated at up to US$106 million. However, it turned out that they will rather provide around US$35 million in-kind contributions, such as land and existing facilities. It had also been reported that Endesa would contribute 20% of the project costs through equity, an amount that was later reduced. Subsequently the IDB had to increase its exposure to US$240 million and the Central American Bank for Economic Integration (CBEI) was called in to provide additional support through three loans totaling US$90 million. The Colombian firm ISA also joined EPR as a shareholder.\\n\\nMore than 90% of the rights of way for the line had been acquired by May 2007. It is expected that the project can benefit from carbon finance under the Clean Development Mechanism of the Kyoto Protocol.\\n\\nSection::::Criticism.\\nCritics have argued that the project will not make electricity cheaper for consumers in Central America, but may actually increase tariffs. Some critics also argue that SIEPAC will facilitate electricity exports to Mexico and not contribute to expand access in Central America. It is also argued that much of the increased generation capacity facilitated by SIEPAC would be in the form of large hydropower with associated social and environmental costs. Also, there are fears that the dominance of the power sector in Central America by large foreign corporations would be increased. Finally, there are some environmental concerns related to the transmission line itself. The initial Environmental Impact Assessment financed by the IDB analyzed only the direct impacts of the transmission line and not its indirect impacts from induced power generation.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'SIEPAC', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7802225'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5QE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7803034', 'text': 'Pilar Partido\\n\\nPilar Partido is a partido in the northern part of Greater Buenos Aires in Buenos Aires Province, Argentina.\\n\\nThe provincial subdivision has a population of about 232,000 inhabitants in an area of , and its capital city is Pilar, which is around from Buenos Aires.\\n\\nIt has universities and schools.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Pilar Partido', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7803034'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5gE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7803940', 'text': 'Pinamar Partido\\n\\nPinamar Partido is a small partido on the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province in Argentina.\\n\\nThe provincial subdivision has a population of about 20,000 inhabitants in an area of , and its capital city is Pinamar, which is around from Buenos Aires.\\n\\nUntil 1978 Pinamar was part of General Madariaga Partido.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nThe economy of Pinamar Partido is dominated by the summer tourist season (DecemberâFebruary), which sees hundreds of thousands of PorteÃ±os make their way to the Atlantic coast of Buenos Aires Province.

During that time, Indian Medical Service was being heavily manned by the British. In 1940, Martin Melvin Curickshank of the Indian Medical Service (IMS) was appointed Medical Superintendent of Irwin Hospital and Chief Medical Officer of New Delhi. He was appointed specifically to establish a medical college complex near Ramlila Maidan. But before his plans could come to fruition, the Second World War started in 1939 and the plan of a new medical college had to be dropped. \\n\\nDuring the Second World War, some barracks were rapidly constructed near Safdarjung\\'s tomb to establish a medical centre for American troops fighting in this region. That hospital was well equipped, with x-ray machine, a laboratory, and other facilities for various emergency procedures. After the Second World War was over, America handed over the hospital to Indian government and it is now known as Safdarjung Hospital. Later a medical college was started there by Central Government Health Scheme of the Health Ministry.\\n\\nMAMC made a very humble beginning in 1958 at the erstwhile Irwin hospital (now the Lok Nayak Jay Prakash Hospital).

It caters to 290 undergradtuate students, 245 post graduate and post doctoral students per year being trained by 426 faculty members and 810 resident doctors. \\n\\nThe medical college offers MBBS and MD and MS degrees and postgraduate residency courses for super-speciality / sub-specialty fellowship degrees of MCh and DM. Institutes offering degrees in nursing and pharmacy are also attached to the college.\\n\\nSection::::Ranking.\\nMAMC was ranked fourth among medical colleges in India in 2017 by \"India Today\" and \"The Week\", and 11 by \"Outlook India\".\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Heritage sites.\\nThe college was established at the 30 acre land of the old Central Jail which was no longer in use after establishment of Tihar Jail at far away Tihar village on fringe of Delhi.

Broom received 2,566 popular votes (0.08%), finishing a poor fifth behind Webster (6,994 votes, 0.22%), who had also been nominated by the Union Party of Georgia. Neither Webster nor Broom received any electoral votes.\\n\\nSection::::Congressional service.\\nBroom was elected as a candidate of the American Party to the Thirty-fourth Congress in 1854.

Ferdinand\\'s reign came to an end with the death of his wife in 1853, but he served as regent for his son and successor, King Pedro V, until 1855. He and Maria founded the House of Braganza-Saxe-Coburg and Gotha, which would rule Portugal until 1910.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn \"Ferdinand August Franz Anton\" in Vienna, he was the eldest son of Prince Ferdinand of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld and his wife Princess Maria Antonia KohÃ¡ry de CsÃ¡brÃ¡g, heiress to the House of KohÃ¡ry. The younger Ferdinand grew up in several places: the family estates in modern-day Slovakia, the imperial court of Austria, and Germany. He was a nephew of King Leopold I of Belgium, and thus a first cousin to Leopold II of Belgium and Empress Carlota of Mexico, as well as Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom and her husband Prince Albert.\\n\\nIn 1826, his title changed from \"Prince of Saxe-Coburg-Saalfeld\" to \"Prince of Saxe-Coburg and Gotha\", following the re-arrangement of the Saxon duchies.\\n\\nSection::::King of Portugal.\\nAccording to Portuguese law, the husband of a queen regnant could only be titled king after the birth of an heir from that marriage; this was the reason Maria II\\'s first husband, Auguste de Beauharnais, Duke of Leuchtenberg, never acquired the title of king. After the birth of their eldest son and heir, the future Pedro V of Portugal, Ferdinand was proclaimed King Dom Fernando II.\\n\\nAlthough it was Maria who reigned by right, the royal couple formed an effective team during their joint reign, with Ferdinand reigning by himself during his wife\\'s pregnancies.\\n\\nEventually, Maria II died as a result of the birth of their eleventh child, and Ferdinand II\\'s reign ended. However, he would assume the regency of Portugal from 1853 to 1855, during the minority of his son King Pedro V.\\n\\nSection::::Later life.\\nIn 1869 he rejected an offer to assume the throne of Spain.\\n\\nFerdinand was an intelligent and artistically minded man with modern and liberal ideas. He was adept at etching, pottery and painting aquarelles. He was the president of the Royal Academy of Sciences and the Arts, Lord Protector of the University of Coimbra and Grand-Master of the Rosicrucians.\\n\\nIn 1838, he acquired the former Hieronymite monastery of Our Lady of Pena, which had been built by King Manuel I in 1511 on the top of the hill above Sintra and had been left unoccupied since 1834, when the religious orders were suppressed in Portugal. The monastery consisted of the cloister and its outbuildings, the chapel, the sacristy and the bell tower, which today form the northern section of the Pena National Palace (the \"Old Palace\").\\n\\nFerdinand began by making repairs to the former monastery, which, according to the historical sources of that time, was in poor condition. He refurbished the whole of the upper floor, replacing the fourteen cells used by the monks with larger-sized rooms and covering them with the vaulted ceilings that can still be seen today. In 1843, the king decided to enlarge the palace by building a new wing (the New Palace) with even larger rooms (one of them being the Great Hall), ending in a circular tower next to the new kitchens. The building work was directed by the Baron von Eschwege, a wild architectural fantasy in an eclectic style full of symbolism that could be compared with the castle Neuschwanstein of King Ludwig II of Bavaria. The palace was built in such a way as to be visible from any point in the park, which consists of a forest and luxuriant gardens with over five hundred different species of trees originating from the four corners of the earth.\\n\\nFerdinand would spend his last years in this castle with his second wife, receiving the greatest artists of his time.\\n\\nSection::::Marriages and descendants.\\nIn 1836 Ferdinand married Maria II, Queen Regnant of Portugal, the daughter and heiress of the late King Pedro IV (and also Emperor Pedro I of Brazil). Eleven children were born to the royal couple before Maria died of complications due to childbirth in 1853. Ferdinand was destined to outlive eight of his eleven children. In late 1861, an attack of cholera or typhoid fever struck the royal family and Ferdinand suffered the tragedy of witnessing the death of three of his five surviving sons.\\n\\nLater in his life, Ferdinand married again in Lisbon on 10 June 1869 to actress Elisa Hensler (NeuchÃ¢tel, 22 May 1836 â Lisbon, CoraÃ§Ã£o de Jesus, 21 May 1929).

Many famous artists have performed there, notably Mariah Carey (whose 1993 top-rated Thanksgiving special was taped there), Britney Spears, Hal Holbrook, Ted Wiles, and George Burns, as well as many others. It has one of the largest movie screens in the Northeast.\\n\\nThe theatre was opened on December 27, 1926. It was designed by architect Thomas Lamb. Four years later it hosted the first public demonstration of television. In 1979 the building was added to the National Register of Historic Places, shortly before being renovated after a long period of decline and neglect. A renovation completed in 2007 added two theatres to the complex, providing a variety of performance spaces.\\n\\nSection::::Building.\\nThe theater building is located on the south side of State Street (NY 5), in a densely developed commercial area. The exterior of the building and its interior arcade are included in the Register listing.\\n\\nIt is a three-story building with attic. The North (front) facade is faced in stucco, with engaged Doric pilasters. Ornamentation includes garlands and paterae on the friezes. A large marquee covers the sidewalk in front.\\n\\nInside, the arcade that connects the entrance to the theatre features space for (originally) 14 boutiques, with five copper-framed glass windows.

Gold leaf detail is all over the domed ceiling and entrance arches, in contrast to the black and silver damask wall coverings. The side loges are trimmed with iron grilles in the arches and heavy velvet drapes. Light is provided by a central black and gold chandelier with 192 lamps, flanked by six smaller fixtures.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe arrival of General Electric led to rapid growth in Schenectady through the late 19th and early 20th century. The city\\'s streetcar network made its downtown more accessible to the city. The vaudeville impresario Frederick Freeman Proctor chose to build his first theater in 1912. In the last years of his life, he decided to replace it. It cost $1.5 million ($ in contemporary dollars) to build and opened on December 27, 1926, with a showing of the silent film \"Stranded in Paris\". The audience was so impressed by the lavish facilities that no one complained about the malfunctioning Wurlitzer organ.\\n\\nProctor had sound equipment installed two years later for the new sound films. Shortly before his death in 1929, Proctor sold his theater chain to RKO Pictures. The next year it was the site of the first public demonstration of television, when an orchestra performed under the direction of the image of a conductor in General Electric Research Laboratory approx 3 miles away.\\n\\nThe theatre had fallen into disrepair throughout the 1960s and \\'70s while population shifted and moved out of Schenectady. The theatre was going to be torn down for use of the plot as a parking lot until a group of activists joined together and created the Arts Districts of Schenectady.\\n\\nIn the fall of 2007, Proctors finished a $24.5 million expansion. Several local firms were involved, including Stracher Roth Gilmore (architectural), Ryan-Biggs Associates (structural), M/E Engineering (mechanical, electrical, plumbing) and Adirondack Scenic (theatrical & rigging designers). The renovation added two theatres, making three separate theatre venues available for the public:\\n\\nIn September 2007, upon completion of the expansion project, Proctor\\'s Theatre changed its name to \"Proctors\" to reflect its three theatres.\\n\\nOn July 18, 2009, the theatre won the Outstanding Historic Theatre Award, presented by the League of Historic American Theatres at their annual meeting in Cleveland.

As such, consumers play a vital role in the economic system of a nation. Without consumer demand, producers would lack one of the key motivations to produce: to sell to consumers. The consumer also forms part of the chain of distribution.\\n\\nRecently in marketing instead of marketers generating broad demographic profiles and Fisio-graphic profiles of market segments, marketers have started to engage in personalized marketing, permission marketing, and mass customization.\\n\\nLargely due to the rise of the Internet, consumers are shifting more and more towards becoming \"prosumers\", consumers who are also producers (often of information and media on the social web), influence the products created (e.g. by customization, crowdfunding or publishing their preferences), actively participate in the production process, or use interactive products.\\n\\nSection::::Law and politics.\\nThe law primarily uses a notion of the consumer in relation to consumer protection laws, and the definition of consumer is often restricted to living persons (i.e. not corporations or businesses) and excludes commercial users. A typical legal rationale for protecting the consumer is based on the notion of policing market failures and inefficiencies, such as inequalities of bargaining power between a consumer and a business. As all potential voters are also consumers, consumer protection has a clear political significance.\\n\\nConcern over the interests of consumers has spawned consumer activism, where organized activists do research, education and advocacy to improve the offer of products and services. Consumer education has been incorporated into some school curricula. There are also various non-profit publications, such as \"Which?\", \"Consumer Reports\" and \"Choice Magazine\", dedicated to assist in consumer education and decision making.\\n\\nIn India, the Consumer Protection Act 1986 differentiates the consummation of a commodity or service for personal use or to earn a livelihood.

He used his full name in his engineering career and Nevil Shute as his pen name to protect his engineering career from any potential negative publicity in connection with his novels, which included \"On the Beach\" and \"A Town Like Alice\".\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn in Somerset Road, Ealing, Middlesex, he was educated at the Dragon School, Shrewsbury School and Balliol College, Oxford; he graduated from Oxford University in 1922 with a third-class degree in engineering science. Shute\\'s father, Arthur Hamilton Norway, became head of the Post Office in Ireland before the First World War and was based at the main post office in Dublin in 1916 at the time of the Easter Rising. Shute himself was later commended for his role as a stretcher-bearer during the rising. On 13 June 1915 his elder brother, Fredrick Hamilton Norway, aged 19, was wounded at Epinette, near ArmentiÃ¨res, and was evacuated to Wimereux where he died, on 4 July, with his parents by his side. He was buried at Wimereux Communal Cemetery, Pas-de-Calais.\\n\\nShute attended the Royal Military Academy, Woolwich, but because of his stammer was unable to take up a commission in the Royal Flying Corps, instead serving in the Great War as a soldier in the Suffolk Regiment.\\n\\nSection::::Career in aviation.\\nAn aeronautical engineer as well as a pilot, he began his engineering career with the De Havilland Aircraft Company. (He used his pen-name as an author to protect his engineering career from any potential negative publicity in connection with his novels.)\\n\\nDissatisfied with the lack of opportunities for advancement, he took a position in 1924 with Vickers Ltd., where he was involved with the development of airships, working as Chief Calculator (stress engineer) on the R100 airship project for the Vickers subsidiary Airship Guarantee Company. In 1929 he was promoted to Deputy Chief Engineer of the R100 project under Barnes Wallis and when Wallis left the project he became the Chief Engineer.\\n\\nThe R100 was a prototype for passenger-carrying airships that would serve the needs of Britain\\'s empire. The government-funded but privately developed R100 made a successful 1930 round trip to Canada. While in Canada it made trips from Montreal to Ottawa, Toronto and Niagara Falls. The fatal 1930 crash in France of its government-developed counterpart R101 ended British interest in dirigibles. The Secretary of State for Air, Lord Thomson, was killed in the crash along with several senior figures in the airship development program. The R100 was immediately grounded and subsequently scrapped. Shute gives a detailed account of the development of the two airships in his 1954 autobiographical work, \"\". His account is very critical of the R101 design and management team, and strongly hints that senior team members were complicit in concealing flaws in the airship\\'s design and construction. In \"The Tender Ship,\" Manhattan Project engineer and Virginia Tech professor Arthur Squires used Shute\\'s account of the R100 and R101 as a primary illustration of his thesis that governments are usually incompetent managers of technology projects.\\n\\nIn 1931, with the cancellation of the R100 project, Shute teamed up with the talented de Havilland trained designer A. Hessell Tiltman to found the aircraft construction company Airspeed Ltd.\\n\\nA site was available in a former trolleybus garage on Piccadilly, York. Despite setbacks, including the usual problems of a new business, Airspeed Limited eventually gained recognition when its Envoy aircraft was chosen for the King\\'s Flight. With the approach of war, a military version of the Envoy was developed, to be called the Airspeed Oxford. The Oxford became the standard advanced multi-engined trainer for the RAF and British Commonwealth, with over 8,500 being built.\\n\\nFor the innovation of developing a hydraulic retractable undercarriage for the Airspeed Courier, and his work on R100, Shute was made a Fellow of the Royal Aeronautical Society.\\n\\nOn 7 March 1931, Shute married Frances Mary Heaton, a 28-year-old medical practitioner. They had two daughters, Heather and Shirley.\\n\\nSection::::Second World War.\\nBy the outbreak of the Second World War, Shute was already a rising novelist. Even as war seemed imminent he was working on military projects with his former boss at Vickers, Sir Dennistoun Burney. He was commissioned into the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve as a sub-lieutenant and quickly ended up in what would become the Directorate of Miscellaneous Weapons Development. There he was a head of engineering, working on secret weapons such as Panjandrum, a job that appealed to the engineer in him. He also developed the Rocket Spear, an anti-submarine missile with a fluted cast iron head. After the first U-boat was sunk by it, Charles Goodeve sent him a message concluding \"I am particularly pleased as it fully substantiates the foresight you showed in pushing this in its early stages. My congratulations.\"\\n\\nHis celebrity as a writer caused the Ministry of Information to send him to the Normandy Landings on 6 June 1944 and later to Burma as a correspondent. He finished the war with the rank of lieutenant commander in the Royal Navy Volunteer Reserves (RNVR).\\n\\nSection::::Literary career.\\nShute\\'s first novel, \"Stephen Morris\", was written in 1923, but not published until 1961.\\n\\nHis first published novel was \"Marazan\", which came out in 1926. After that he averaged one novel every two years through the 1950s, with the exception of a six-year hiatus while he was establishing his own aircraft construction company, Airspeed Ltd. His popularity grew slowly with each novel, but he became much more famous after the publication of \"On the Beach\" in 1957.\\n\\nShute\\'s novels are written in a simple, highly readable style, with clearly delineated plot lines. Where there is a romantic element, sex is referred to only obliquely. Many of the stories are introduced by a narrator who is not a character in the story. The most common theme in Shute\\'s novels is the dignity of work, spanning all classes, whether an Eastern European bar \"hostess\" (\"Ruined City\") or brilliant boffin (\"No Highway\").\\n\\nAnother recurrent theme is the bridging of social barriers such as class (\"Lonely Road\" and \"Landfall\"), race (\"The Chequer Board\"), or religion (\"Round the Bend\"). The Australian novels are individual hymns to that country, with subtle disparagement of the mores of the United States (\"Beyond the Black Stump\") and overt antipathy towards the post-World War II socialist government of Shute\\'s native Britain (\"The Far Country\" and \"In the Wet\").\\n\\nShute\\'s heroes tended to be like himself: middle class solicitors, doctors, accountants, bank managers, engineers, generally university graduates. However (as in \"Trustee from the Toolroom\"), Shute valued the honest artisans and their social integrity and contributions to society more than the contributions of the upper classes.\\n\\nAviation and engineering provide the backdrop for many of Shute\\'s novels. He identified how engineering, science, and design could improve human life and more than once used the anonymous epigram, \"It has been said an engineer is a man who can do for five shillings what any fool can do for a pound.\"\\n\\nSeveral of Shute\\'s novels explored the boundary between accepted science and rational belief, on the one hand, and mystical or paranormal possibilities, including reincarnation, on the other hand. Shute did this by including elements of fantasy and science fiction in novels that were considered mainstream. They included Buddhist astrology and folk prophecy in \"The Chequer Board\"; the effective use of a Planchette in \"No Highway;\" a messiah figure in \"Round the Bend\"; reincarnation, science fiction, and Aboriginal psychic powers in \"In the Wet.\"\\n\\nTwenty-four of his novels and novellas have been published. Many of his books have been adapted for the screen, including \"Lonely Road\" in 1936; \"Landfall: A Channel Story\" in 1949; \"Pied Piper\" in 1942, 1959, and as \"Crossing to Freedom,\" a CBS made-for-television movie, in 1990; \"On the Beach\" in 1959 and in 2000 as a two-part miniseries; and \"No Highway\" in 1951. \"A Town Like Alice\" was adapted in 1956 and serialized for Australian television in 1981, and was broadcast on BBC Radio 2 in 1997 starring Jason Connery, Becky Hindley, Bernard Hepton and Virginia McKenna. Shute\\'s 1952 novel \"The Far Country\" was filmed for television as six one-hour episodes in 1972, and as a two-part miniseries in 1987.\\n\\nVintage Books reprinted all 23 of his books in 2009.\\n\\nShute\\'s final work was published more than 40 years after his death. \"The Seafarers\" was first drafted in 1946â47, subsequently rewritten, and then put aside. In 1948, Shute again rewrote it, changing the title to \"Blind Understanding,\" but he left the manuscript incomplete. According to Dan Telfair in the foreword of the 2002 edition, some of the themes in \"The Seafarers\" and \"Blind Understanding\" were used in Shute\\'s 1955 novel \"Requiem for a Wren\".\\n\\nSection::::Activities after the war.\\nIn 1948, Shute flew his own Percival Proctor airplane to Australia and back, accompanied by the writer James Riddell, who published a book, \"Flight of Fancy,\" based on the trip, in 1950.\\n\\nOn his return, concerned about what he saw as the decline of his home country, he decided that he and his family would emigrate to Australia. In 1950, he settled with his wife and two daughters on farmland at Langwarrin, south-east of Melbourne. Remembering his 1930 trip to Canada and his decision to emigrate to Australia, he wrote, in 1954, \"For the first time in my life I saw how people live in an English-speaking country outside England.\" Although he intended to remain in Australia, he did not apply for Australian citizenship, which was at that time a mere formality because he was a British subject.\\n\\nIn the 1950s and 1960s he was one of the world\\'s best-selling novelists, although his popularity has since declined in Australia.\\n\\nBetween 1956 and 1958 in Australia, he took up car racing as a hobby, driving a white Jaguar XK140. Some of this experience found its way into his book \"On the Beach \".\\n\\nShute died in Melbourne in 1960 after a stroke.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Honours.\\nNorway Road and Nevil Shute Road at Portsmouth Airport, Hampshire were both named after him. Shute Avenue in Berwick, Victoria was named after him, when the farm used for filming the 1959 film \"On The Beach\" was subdivided for housing.\\n\\nThe public library in Alice Springs, Northern Territory is the Nevil Shute Memorial Library.\\n\\nIn the Readers\\' List of the Modern Library 100 Best Novels of the 20th century, \"A Town Like Alice\" came in at number 17, \"Trustee from the Toolroom\" at 27, and \"On the Beach\" at 56.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Nevil Shute', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=78191', 'cat_id': '78191', 'cat_title': 'Businesspeople_of_Indian_descent', 'cat_pages': '43', 'cat_subcats': '4', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '9wE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb16', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7820287', 'text': 'Cabidela\\n\\nCabidela () or arroz de cabidela (\"cabidela\" rice) is a Portuguese dish made with poultry or rabbit cooked in its own blood added to water and a bit of vinegar much like \"jugged\" or \"civet\" dishes.

The draft standard was ratified on 24 June 2004. This standard specifies security mechanisms for wireless networks, replacing the short \"Authentication and privacy\" clause of the original standard with a detailed \"Security\" clause. In the process, the amendment deprecated broken Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), while it was later incorporated into the published IEEE 802.11-2007 standard.\\n\\nSection::::Replacement of WEP.\\n802.11i supersedes the previous security specification, Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP), which was shown to have security vulnerabilities. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) had previously been introduced by the Wi-Fi Alliance as an intermediate solution to WEP insecurities. WPA implemented a subset of a draft of 802.11i. The Wi-Fi Alliance refers to their approved, interoperable implementation of the full 802.11i as WPA2, also called RSN (Robust Security Network). 802.11i makes use of the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) block cipher, whereas WEP and WPA use the RC4 stream cipher.\\n\\nSection::::Protocol operation.\\nIEEE 802.11i enhances IEEE 802.11-1999 by providing a Robust Security Network (RSN) with two new protocols: the four-way handshake and the group key handshake. These utilize the authentication services and port access control described in IEEE 802.1X to establish and change the appropriate cryptographic keys. The RSN is a security network that only allows the creation of robust security network associations (RSNAs), which are a type of association used by a pair of stations (STAs) if the procedure to establish authentication or association between them includes the 4-Way Handshake. \\n\\nThe standard also provides two RSNA data confidentiality and integrity protocols, TKIP and CCMP, with implementation of CCMP being mandatory since the confidentiality and integrity mechanisms of TKIP are not as robust as those of CCMP. The main purpose to implement TKIP was that the algorithm should be implementable within the capabilities of most of the old devices supporting only WEP.\\n\\nThe initial authentication process is carried out either using a pre-shared key (PSK), or following an EAP exchange through 802.1X (known as EAPOL, which requires the presence of an authentication server). This process ensures that the client station (STA) is authenticated with the access point (AP). After the PSK or 802.1X authentication, a shared secret key is generated, called the Pairwise Master Key (PMK). The PMK is derived from a password that is put through PBKDF2-SHA1 as the cryptographic hash function. In a pre-shared-key network, the PMK is actually the PSK. If an 802.1X EAP exchange was carried out, the PMK is derived from the EAP parameters provided by the authentication server.\\n\\nSection::::Four-way handshake.\\nThe four-way handshake is designed so that the access point (or authenticator) and wireless client (or supplicant) can independently prove to each other that they know the PSK/PMK, without ever disclosing the key. Instead of disclosing the key, the access point (AP) and client encrypt messages to each otherâthat can only be decrypted by using the PMK that they already shareâand if decryption of the messages was successful, this proves knowledge of the PMK. The four-way handshake is critical for protection of the PMK from malicious access pointsâfor example, an attacker\\'s SSID impersonating a real access pointâso that the client never has to tell the access point its PMK. \\n\\nThe PMK is designed to last the entire session and should be exposed as little as possible; therefore, keys to encrypt the traffic need to be derived. A four-way handshake is used to establish another key called the Pairwise Transient Key (PTK). The PTK is generated by concatenating the following attributes: PMK, AP nonce (ANonce), STA nonce (SNonce), AP MAC address, and STA MAC address. The product is then put through a pseudo-random function. The handshake also yields the GTK (Group Temporal Key), used to decrypt multicast and broadcast traffic. \\n\\nThe actual messages exchanged during the handshake are depicted in the figure and explained below (all messages are sent as EAPOL-Key frames):\\n\\nThe Pairwise Transient Key (64 bytes) is divided into five separate keys:\\n\\nThe Group Temporal Key (32 bytes) is divided into three separate keys:\\n\\nThe Michael MIC Authenticator Tx/Rx Keys in both the PTK and GTK are only used if the network is using TKIP to encrypt the data.\\n\\nThis four-way handshake has been shown to be vulnerable to KRACK.\\n\\nSection::::Group key handshake.\\nThe Group Temporal Key (GTK) used in the network may need to be updated due to the expiration of a preset timer. When a device leaves the network, the GTK also needs to be updated. This is to prevent the device from receiving any more multicast or broadcast messages from the AP.\\n\\nTo handle the updating, 802.11i defines a \"Group Key Handshake\" that consists of a two-way handshake:\\n\\nSection::::CCMP overview.\\nCCMP is based on the Counter with CBC-MAC (CCM) mode of the AES encryption algorithm. CCM combines CTR for confidentiality and CBC-MAC for authentication and integrity. CCM protects the integrity of both the MPDU Data field and selected portions of the IEEE 802.11 MPDU header.\\n\\nSection::::Key hierarchy.\\nRSNA defines two key hierarchies:\\n\\n\\nThe description of the key hierarchies uses the following two functions:\\n\\n\\nThe pairwise key hierarchy utilizes PRF-384 or PRF-512 to derive session-specific keys from a PMK, generating a PTK, which gets partitioned into a KCK and a KEK plus all the temporal keys used by the MAC to protect unicast communication.\\n\\nThe GTK shall be a random number which also gets generated by using PRF-n, usually PRF-128 or PRF-256, in this model, the group key hierarchy takes a GMK (Group Master Key) and generates a GTK.\\n\\nSection::::MAC frame formats.\\nSection::::Protected Frame field.\\n\"The Protected Frame field is 1 bit in length. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 if the Frame Body field contains information that has been processed by a cryptographic encapsulation algorithm. The Protected Frame field is set to 1 only within data frames of type Data and within management frames of type Management, subtype Authentication. The Protected Frame field is set to 0 in all other frames. When the bit Protected Frame field is set to 1 in a data frame, the Frame Body field is protected utilizing the cryptographic encapsulation algorithm and expanded as defined in Clause 8. Only WEP is allowed as the cryptographic encapsulation algorithm for management frames of subtype Authentication.\"\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'IEEE 802.11i-2004', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783135', 'cat_id': '783135', 'cat_title': 'Museums_in_Richland_County,_Ohio', 'cat_pages': '4', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'AAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7834816', 'text': 'Saputo\\n\\nSaputo may refer to:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Saputo', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7834816'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'AQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7836038', 'text': \"John Chew\\n\\nJohn Chew Hiang Chea ; born 4 October 1947) was the third Metropolitan Archbishop and Primate of the Province of Anglican Church in South East Asia as well as Bishop of Singapore.

The audio quality of the second version is not as full sounding as the first. Thus, the second version must be a restored version. It is likely that the first version was the one released in the theaters in 1964.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nDuring the late 12th century, about 100 years after the Norman conquest (1066), the Normans have removed the native ruling class, replacing it with a new monarchy, aristocracy and clerical hierarchy.\\n\\nThomas Becket is a Saxon protÃ©gÃ© and facilitator to the carousing King Henry II, who transforms into a man who continually invokes the \"honour of God\". Henry appoints Becket Lord Chancellor to have a close confidant in this position whom he can completely control. Instead, Becket becomes a major thorn in his side in a jurisdictional dispute. Henry finds his duties as king and his stale arranged marriage to be oppressive, and is described as the \"perennial adolescent\" by the Bishop of London. Henry is more interested in escaping his duties through drunken forays onto the hunting grounds and local brothels. He is increasingly dependent on Becket, a Saxon commoner, who arranges these debaucheries when he is not busy running Henry\\'s court. This foments great resentment on the part of Henry\\'s Norman noblemen, who distrust and envy this Saxon upstart, as well as the queen and Henry\\'s mother, who see Becket as an unnatural and unseemly influence upon the royal personage.\\n\\nHenry finds himself in continuous conflict with the elderly Archbishop of Canterbury, who opposes the taxation of Church property to support Henry\\'s military campaigns in France (\"Bishop, I must hire the Swiss Guards to fight for me â and no one has ever paid them off with principles!\"). During one of his campaigns in coastal France, he receives word that the old archbishop has \"gone to God\\'s bosom\". In a burst of inspiration, Henry exercises his prerogative to pick the next Archbishop and informs an astonished Becket that he is the royal choice.\\n\\nShortly thereafter, Becket sides with the Church, throwing Henry into a fury. One of the main bones of contention is Thomas\\' excommunication of Lord Gilbert, one of Henry\\'s most loyal stalwarts, for seizing and ordering the killing of a priest who had been accused of sexual indiscretions with a young girl, before the priest can even be handed over for ecclesiastical trial. Gilbert then refused to acknowledge his transgressions and seek absolution.\\n\\nThe King has a dramatic secret meeting with the Bishop of London in his cathedral (\"I have the Archbishop on my stomach, a big hard lump\"). He lays out his plan to remove the troublesome cleric through scandal and innuendo, which the position-conscious Bishop of London quickly agrees to (thus furthering Henry\\'s already deep contempt for church higher-ups). These attempts fall flat when Becket, in full ecclesiastic garb, confronts his accusers outside the rectory and routs them, causing Henry to laugh and bitterly note the irony of it all; \"Becket is the only intelligent man in my entire kingdom ... and he is against me!\" Becket escapes to France where he encounters the conniving yet sympathetic King Louis (John Gielgud). King Louis sees in Becket a means by which he can further his favourite pastime, tormenting the arrogant English. Becket gets to Rome, where he begs the Pope to allow him to renounce his position and retire to a monastery as an ordinary priest. The Vatican is a hotbed of intrigue and political jockeying. The Pope reminds Becket that he has an obligation as a matter of principle to return to England and take a stand against civil interference in Church matters. Becket yields to this decision and asks Louis to arrange a meeting with Henry on the beaches at Normandy. Henry asks Becket whether or not he loved him and Becket replied that he loved Henry to the best of his ability. A shaky truce is declared and Becket is allowed to return to England.\\n\\nThe remainder of the film shows Henry rapidly sinking into drunken fixation over Becket and his perceived betrayal. The barons worsen his mood by pointing out that Becket has become a folk hero among the vanquished Saxons, who are ever restive and resentful of their Norman conquerors. There are comical fights between Henry and his frumpy consort, Eleanor of Aquitaine, his dimwitted son/heir apparent, and his cold-blooded mother, who repeatedly reminds her son that his father would have quickly had someone like Becket done away with for the sake of the realm. During one of his drunken rages he asks \"Will no one rid me of this meddlesome priest?\" His faithful barons hear this and proceed quickly to Canterbury, where they put Thomas and his Saxon deputy, Brother John, to the sword. A badly shaken Henry then undergoes a penance by whipping at the hands of Saxon monks.\\n\\nHenry, fresh from his whipping, publicly proclaims that Thomas Becket is a saint and that the ones who killed him will be justly punished.\\n\\nSection::::Preservation.\\nThe Academy Film Archive preserved \"Becket\" in 2003.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Historicity.\\nMost of the historical inaccuracies in the film are from the play, as Anouilh was writing drama rather than a history, and he took dramatic licence.\\n\\nThe major inaccuracy is the depiction of Becket as a Saxon who has risen to a perceived Norman social standing, when in fact the historical Thomas Becket was a Norman (while Henry was an Angevin). Anouilh did this because he had based the play on a 19th-century account that described Becket as a Saxon. He had been informed of this error before his play was produced, but decided against correcting it because it would undermine a key point of conflict, and because \"history might eventually rediscover that Becket was a Saxon, after all.\"\\n\\nBecket is depicted as Henry\\'s loyal \"drinking pal\", who aids him in illicit romantic entanglements, but who becomes saintly and responsible after his appointment as Archbishop. Passing mention is made in the film of the Constitutions of Clarendon (simply as the \"Sixteen Articles\"); the struggle between Becket and Henry is boiled down to their conflict over Lord Gilbert\\'s murder of the captive priest. In no way is Becket depicted as a man who desired special legal privileges (defrocking rather than prison) for his clergy, as some believe that he was.\\n\\nHenry\\'s mother, Empress Matilda, died in 1167, three years before the treaty of FrÃ©teval allowed Becket to return in England. Henry appears to not have any respect for his mother and treats her as something of an annoyance, a rather drastic departure from what is generally held as historical fact. Empress Matilda was Henry\\'s sole parent for much of his childhood, and she was instrumental in shaping Henry into the fierce warrior and skilled administrator he was. Far from seeing his mother as a burden, Henry seems to have adored Matilda and relied heavily on her advice and guidance until her death.\\n\\nHenry\\'s wife, Eleanor of Aquitaine was in fact beautiful, brilliant and superbly educated, famous for her wit, charm and daring.\\n\\nShe is shown publicly rebuking Henry in a scene near the end of the film, when in fact Eleanor, whatever private reservations she may have had, is not known to have ever behaved in such a manner in public. During the same scene, she says she will go to her father to complain of Henry\\'s treatment of her; however, her father had died decades before, when Eleanor was just 15 years old. It was her father\\'s death that made Eleanor the Duchess of Aquitaine and the most eligible bride of the 12th century, and Henry would not have married her had she not come with Aquitaine. When combined with Henry\\'s own duchies in France, the marriage gave the royal couple control over more land in France than the actual King of France possessed at the time. Also, the film shows Henry and Eleanor as having four children, all boys. In truth Henry and Eleanor had \"eight\" children, five sons and three daughters. While the eldest son, William, had died before the events of the film, the three daughters are neglected.\\n\\nSection::::Production financing.\\nThe film grossed $9,164,370 at the box office, earning $3 million in rentals.\\n\\nSection::::Awards and nominations.\\nThe film won an Academy Award and received eleven other nominations:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Becket (1964 film)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7837396'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7839260', 'text': 'Krasny, Krasninsky District, Smolensk Oblast\\n\\nKrasny () is an urban locality (an urban-type settlement) and the administrative center of Krasninsky District of Smolensk Oblast, Russia, located at the confluence of the Svinaya and the Mereya Rivers southwest of Smolensk. Population: \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nKrasny (originally Krasn or Krasen) is first mentioned in 1165 by the Hypatian Codex, when Davyd Rostislavich, Prince of Smolensk, gave Krasen to his nephew, Roman of Vitebsk. Between second half of the 14th century and the middle of the 17th century, the area belonged intermittently to the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, to Poland, and to the Grand Duchy of Moscow. Since 1654, it was finally transferred to the Tsardom of Russia.\\n\\nIn the course of the administrative reform carried out in 1708 by Peter the Great, the area was included into Smolensk Governorate and remained there until 1929, with the exception of the brief period between 1775 and 1796, when Smolensk Governorate was transformed into Smolensk Viceroyalty. The area belonged to Krasninsky Uyezd, which was established in 1775. In 1776, Krasny was granted town status. In 1796, the uyezd was abolished but it was re-established in 1802. \\n\\nDuring the French invasion of Russia, Krasny played an important role, since the French army passed it twice en route to and from Russia. The battle in August 1812 was a lesser action of Murat\\'s advance guard against the small retreating Russian rearguard of Dmitry Neverovsky. The French ran into unexpectedly strong resistance from the Russians. In his Napoleonic history, de SÃ©gur wrote that Neverovsky retreated \"like a lion\".\\n\\nAt the Battle of Krasnoi in November 1812, the Russian army inflicted heavy losses on the remnants of the French Grande ArmÃ©e. There are two monuments in Krasny commemorating that event, both erected in 1912. \\n\\nOn 12 July 1929, governorates and uyezds were abolished, and Krasninsky District with the administrative center in Krasny was established. Krasny did not retain the town status during Soviet times. The district belonged to Smolensk Okrug of Western Oblast. On August 1, 1930 the okrugs were abolished, and the districts were subordinated directly to the oblast. On 27 September 1937 Western Oblast was abolished and split between Oryol and Smolensk Oblasts. Krasninsky District was transferred to Smolensk Oblast. Between 1941 and 1943, during WWII, Krasny was occupied by German troops. On 1 February 1963, during the abortive Khrushchyov administrative reform, Krasninsky District was merged into Smolensky District, but in 1965 it was re-established.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nIndustry includes flax and dairy processing, vegetable processing, and manufacture of drainage pipes.\\n\\nSection::::Transportation.\\nKrasny has access to M1 \"Belarus\" Highway and is additionally connected by paved roads with Smolensk and with Orsha (so called Old Smolensk Road).\\n\\nSection::::Culture and recreation.\\nKrasny contains nine objects classified as cultural and historical heritage of local significance.\\n\\nIn Krasny, there is a museum of local lore, whose three exhibits include materials on the Patriotic War of 1812, Great Patriotic War of 1941â1945, and on modern life at the settlement.\\n\\nOn September\\xa027, 2009, the \"Walk of Heroes\" history museum opened in Krasny.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Krasny, Krasninsky District, Smolensk Oblast', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7839260'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '783962', 'text': \"Raahe\\n\\nRaahe () is a town and municipality of Finland. Founded by Swedish statesman and Governor General of Finland Count Per Brahe the Younger in 1649, it is one of 10 historic wooden towns (or town centers) remaining in Finland. Examples of other Finnish historic wooden towns are Kaskinen (KaskÃ¶), Old Rauma, Porvoo (BorgÃ¥), Jakobstad (Pietarsaari), and Vaasa (Vasa). After a devastating fire in 1810, Raahe was rebuilt adhering to new design principles which minimized the risk of fire and enlarged some civic spaces. Old Raahe is noted for its Renaissance-inspired rectilinear town plan featuring an unusual central-square (called Pekkatori) with closed corners.\\n\\nRaahe is located on the northern shores of the Gulf of Bothnia in the region of North Ostrobothnia . The municipality has a population of () and covers an area of of which is water. The population density is . Historically an agricultural and maritime region, Ostrobothnia supplied the largest number of immigrants from Finland to the US and other countries such as Canada and Australia during the great migration of the late 19th and early 20th centuries.\\n\\nFounded as a Swedish-and-Finnish-speaking town, the municipality is now unilingually Finnish.\\n\\nThe asteroid 1786 Raahe was named after this town and municipality.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Seventeenth century history.\\nCount Per Brahe the Younger, the governor-general of Finland, gave a charter to the town of Salo in the year of 1649 with the purpose of constructing a town at Satamakangas, near the old harbour site. However, the harbour area had become so low that the future town was decided to be transferred. A new and better location was found further to the north, at the bay of Raahe. Having acquired the possession of the parish of Salo in 1652, Per Brahe renamed the town Brahestad or Raahe in Finnish.\\n\\nThe planning of the town for the purpose of building Raahe was given to the surveyor Claes Claesson. His town plan followed the ideals of the regular grid plan of the Renaissance. All of the streets of Raahe were of equal width of 20-21 cubits or 10â11 meters. The market square stood by Rantakatu and the Town Hall behind the square. At the northeast corner of the town stood the church and the schoolhouse. Six blocks were realized of the town plan, i.e. the area surrounded by present-day Koulukatu, Kirkkokatu, Saaristokatu and Rantakatu. The later expansion and changes of the town have held the ambitions of Claesson's town plan in respect until the beginning of the latest century.\\n\\nThe oldest picture still remaining of the town of Raahe, a seventeenth-century drawing, dates back to the year of 1659. It depicts the town as being surrounded by a so-called customs fence with two custom gates, the eastern one located outside of the crossroads of present-day Brahenkatu and Reiponkatu streets and the southern one at the end of PitkÃ¤katu street (present-day Kauppakatu street) approximately by present-day Koulukatu street. The busy harbour of the town was located on the shore by the customs warehouse, the present museum.\\n\\nThere were two public buildings in Raahe: a handsome, admirable, two-story town hall with a tower, and a wooden church, whose construction had already begun in 1651. The church was given a weather boarding already in 1684-1685. This is one of the earliest examples of boarding known in Finland.\\n\\nThe dwellings and houses were made from logs. As a rule, they were built close to the street facing plot boundary, the long side and the ridge of the roof parallel to the street. The unbuilt portion of the plot against the street was fitted up with a high, solid plank fence and a drive-in gate. The plots inside a block were not separated by fences. The average house usually consisted of one or two rooms, most of which were of the two-room cabin type. Almost every house in the drawing of Raahe has the most remarkable novelty of the seventeenth century, the chimney. At the same time it was still quite common to have whole towns and villages with chimneyless houses, especially in Eastern Finland. Considered from the point of view of architectural history, at the time of its foundation Raahe was a quite modern town. As far as is known today, no buildings exist from the seventeenth century.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nRaahe was granted Staple port rights in 1791 and was traditionally a harbor town. With industrialization, Raahe was reinvented as a steel and heavy industry city and has further developed with engineering services, ICT and software production. Raahe is known for steel, heavy machinery, engineering works, shipping and ICT. The Rautaruukki steel mill, which up to the 1980s was the largest single industrial site in the Nordic countries, is located in Raahe. The mill produces steel plate, coil and sheeting and semi-finished products for the engineering works.\\n\\nTraditionally, Raahe was a port city. In the late Age of Sail, the 1850s and on, shipping companies in Raahe owned Finland's largest fleet of sailing vessels, 60 in total at their height. Currently, the port of Raahe is the sixth busiest port in the country, with 700 ships visiting each year. Cargo that is transported through the port includes raw materials and loose cargo, steel, lumber, containers and contract-shipped goods.\\n\\nWith the steel industry, Raahe has grown into the third largest city in the ex-Oulu province, after Oulu and Kajaani. Like Oulu, the city promotes the ICT business, with the help of the steel industry (ProMetal and Steelpolis) and ICT industry (Softpolis) business incubators/business parks.\\n\\nThe municipal tax rate is 19.75%. In 2007, the structure of the economy was as follows: agriculture and forestry 1%, construction 6%, manufacturing 43%, and retail, services and public services 50%. The sub-region includes the municipalities of PyhÃ¤joki and Siikajoki.\\n\\nSection::::International relations.\\nSection::::Twin towns â Sister cities.\\nRaahe is twinned with:\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Raahe', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=783962', 'cat_id': '783962', 'cat_title': 'Songs_written_by_Bob_Regan', 'cat_pages': '16', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7841321', 'text': 'Helene (name)\\n\\nHelene () is a female given name, a variant of Helen, using the French spelling.

Gladys was created and is maintained by artist/owner James Lebinski since August 2002. The underlying sculpture is a fiberglass Swiss dairy cow, and is the same shape and size as the famous CowParade cows.\\n\\nLebinski has created more than 50 pieces of art using the sculpture by decorating it with paint, cloth, and various other materials for each holiday. Gladys was displayed in Fairfield, Connecticut, from October 2002 until April 2006, and can currently be found in Monroe, Connecticut.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn July 2002, Lebinski recovered a fiberglass cow sculpture from a Dumpster in Norwalk, Connecticut. Lebinski repaired the sculpture\\'s smashed body and four broken legs and painted it pink. Gladys was placed on display in Fairfield, Connecticut in August 2002. The sculpture became an object of attention and resulted in suggestions to the artist to create whimsical seasonal designs using the sculpture as a base.\\n\\nSection::::Early development.\\nIn 2002, the first seasonal artwork using the sculpture was titled \"Gladys as a Skeleton\", and was created for Halloween. A significant amount of public attention was generated by this artwork, and this attention was the genesis of the ongoing project to create holiday-themed art. \\nThe next piece was created for Christmas 2002. The cow sculpture was painted as Santa Claus and the artwork was titled \"Gladys as Santa Cow\". These two works gained public attention and generated initial press coverage.\\n\\nSection::::2003.\\nThe ongoing creation of works based on the cow sculpture continued in 2003. \\nThe first work for the cow sculpture in 2003 was for Valentine\\'s Day and was titled \"Gladys as a Valentine\". Next, in March 2003, the cow sculpture was converted to \"Gladys as a Leprechaun\". The use of a single prop was in keeping with using paint as a primary medium.\\n\\nIn April 2003, the media used to create the art was expanded to include additional props and attachments.\\n\\nIn May 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as Uncle Sam\". The art was then incorporated into a parade float for the 2003 Fairfield Memorial Day Parade. This was the first large-scale public exhibition of the work. As a result, the work was awarded \"Best Appearing FloatâService Club\" by the 2003 Fairfield Memorial Day Parade Committee.\\n\\nIn July 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys in an Itsy-Bitsy Teenie-Weenie Yellow Polka Dot Bikini\". The use of props was expanded to include props that were not physically attached to the sculpture.\\nIn August 2003, the cow sculpture was converted to art with a first-day-of school motif. The work \"Gladys as a School Bus\" represented the first piece that was designed to closely resemble a real-life object, and was achieved in a paint-only medium.\\n\\nIn October 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as a Scarecrow\", inspired by The Wizard of Oz. This marked the first complete departure from the sculpture as a painted work. The use of straw, natural fiber, burlap, and organic materials was incorporated to achieve a fall motif. \\n\\nIn December 2003, the cow sculpture was converted into a Christmas theme: \"Gladys as a Reindeer\". This work was featured in a multi-page article in the \"Fairfield Citizen-News\".\\n\\nSection::::2004.\\nIn February 2004, the sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as a Valentine Bride\".\\n\\nIn March 2004, the cow sculpture was converted into a Saint Patrick\\'s Day work. The rainbow colors were true to the Roy G. Biv color spectrum of a rainbow. Ultimately, a pot of gold prop was added, along with a second piece of public art titled \"Sophie as a Leprechaun\" to clarify the \"pot-of-gold-at-the-end-of-the-rainbow\" theme.\\n\\nFor Easter in April 2004, the sculpture was transformed into a work of art that featured an Easter bonnet prop, and multiple painted Easter eggs with individual images.\\n\\nIn May 2004, the Uncle Sam motif was re-created, representing the first time a work was repeated. The art was featured as an entry in the 2004 Fairfield Memorial Day Parade. The work was awarded \"honorable mention\" by the 2004 Fairfield Memorial Day Committee.\\n\\nIn August 2004, the cow sculpture was transformed into a tribute to the Fairfield Fire Department, Station 2. The work incorporated memorial logos for the Worcester 6, and 9/11 FDNY. The firefighters\\' union logo and Irish firefighter logo were also reproduced.\\n\\nIn October 2004, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as Dracula\". Additionally, an Ogden Nash poem was incorporated on a tombstone prop.\\n\\nIn December 2004, the cow sculpture was converted into a lighted Christmas tree. The use of additional props was expanded to incorporate day-visible ornaments, presents, and a Christmas tree, as well as night-visible multicolored lights.\\n\\nSection::::2005.\\nIn January 2005, the cow sculpture was converted into \"Gladys as a Mardi Gras Jester\".\\n\\nIn April 2005, the cow sculpture, was designed in a Spring/Easter scheme and represented the first use of a sponge painting technique to achieve the green grass effect, with sufficient fading to deliver a suitable image.\\n\\nThe next work based on the cow sculpture was \"Gladys as an Animal Control Vehicle\" in tribute to the Fairfield Police Department Animal Control Department.\\n\\nIn December 2005, the cow sculpture was used to create \"Gladys as a Shepherd\". The primary medium was blue and white textured cotton cloth.\\n\\nSection::::2006.\\nIn January 2006, the cow sculpture was converted to \"Gladys as a Cow\". The motif was a black and white spotted cow.\\n\\nIn April 2006, the sculpture was placed on display in Monroe, Connecticut.\\n\\nIn October 2006, the cow sculpture was painted as \"Gladys as a Skeleton\" and was incorporated into Gaffney\\'s Ghoulish House, a charity food drive with a halloween haunted house theme.\\n\\nSection::::2007.\\nIn December 2007, the cow sculpture was placed on display as \"Gladys as Santa Claus\". Along with Gladys, \"Goldie the Cow\" was created and decorated as a reindeer, and Sophie the Pig was created and decorated as an elf.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Gladys the Swiss Dairy Cow', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7862726'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '786566', 'text': \"Charter township\\n\\nA charter township is a form of local government in the U.S. state of Michigan. Townships in Michigan are organized governments. A charter township has been granted a charter, which allows it certain rights and responsibilities of home rule that are generally intermediate between those of a city (a semi-autonomous jurisdiction in Michigan) and a village. Unless it is a home-rule village, the latter is subject to the authority of any township in which it is located.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSeeing the pressure of suburbanization in many post-war communities, in 1947, the state legislature created a special charter township status, which grants additional powers and streamlined administration in order to provide greater protection against annexation of a township's land by cities and villages. As of November 2014, there were 118 charter townships in Michigan (Alpena Township became chartered in February 26, 2018). A township with a population of 2,000 or more may incorporate as a charter township and become a municipal corporation, which possesses all the powers of a non-charter township, in addition to those specified by the Charter Township Act of 1947.\\n\\nSection::::Government.\\nLegislative authority is exercised by an elected township board of seven members, consisting of the supervisor, the township clerk, the township treasurer, and four trustees, who are eligible to vote in elections and are residents of the township. All members of the board serve four-year terms. Unlike the boards for general law townships, which may have either five or seven members, a charter township must have seven members. If a general law township with a five-member board elects to become a charter township, two additional members are to be elected in the next general election.\\n\\nCharter townships may appoint either a township superintendent or township manager, who can be assigned responsibilities for managing township functions (this is comparable to cities that hire a city manager to oversee the day-to-day operations of the city). Otherwise, executive authority lies with the supervisor, and various committees.\\n\\nSection::::Privileges.\\nA charter township may establish a variety of municipal services, such as a police force, fire department, assessors and also acquire property. It may also borrow money and issue bonds, with the approval of a majority of township voting in an election. Similarly, a charter township cannot levy taxes without the approval of a majority of the township population voting in an election. This is one significant difference from home-rule municipalities, in which the municipal authority can levy taxes without specific approval from voters.\\n\\nSection::::Requirements.\\nA charter township is mostly exempt from annexation from contiguous cities or villages providing that the township meets certain requirements:\\n\\nSection::::Annexation and 425 Agreements.\\nA charter township may still be subject to annexation under certain conditions, such as for the purpose of eliminating isolated islands of township or by vote of a majority of the residents of a portion of township. Temporary land transfers, which can involve charter townships, have provision under Public Act 425 of 1984. Under this statute, a charter township, for example, can have land transferred to a city in exchange for revenue sharing of the transferred parcels. These agreements, known as 425 Agreements, can last up to 50 years, and the land can either be completely transferred to the city or returned to the township upon fulfillment of the agreement.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Charter township', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=786566'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7866339', 'text': 'Trish Keenan\\n\\nPatricia Anne Keenan (28 September 1968 â 14 January 2011) was an English musician and singer. She was the lead vocalist and founding member of the electronic band Broadcast, which she formed in 1996. The band released a total of five studio albums, including \"The Noise Made by People\" (2000), \"Haha Sound\" (2003), and \"Tender Buttons\" (2005), and earned a cult following.\\n\\nKeenan died unexpectedly in January 2011 of pneumonia, shortly after she had contracted swine flu while completing a tour of Australia with Broadcast.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nTrish Keenan was born in Winson Green, a multicultural inner-city area in west Birmingham, England. She was raised by her mother, who was a prostitute: \"I have got no problem with people knowing me or any personal details about myself,\" she commented. \"I have had a crazy life: I was brought up by a prostitute.\"\\n\\nKeenan attended Archbishop Grimshaw Roman Catholic school, presently known as John Henry Newman Catholic school. She worked a range of catering jobs after school until at the age of 21 she moved to Moseley, a bohemian enclave. She studied Creative Writing at Birmingham University while working on her music career. \\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSoon after moving to Moseley, Keenan formed a musical duo called Hayward Winters, and subsequently met James Cargill at a 1960s psychedelic revival club. The two of them formed a relationship over their shared interest and formed a folk band, Pan Am Flight Bag. The band was short-lived only performing two gigs before they reformed in 1996 as Broadcast, which included guitarist Tim Felton, drummer Steve Perkins, and keyboardist Roj Stevens.\\n\\nWith Broadcast, Keenan released a total of five studio albums, including \"The Noise Made by People\" (2000), \"Haha Sound\" (2003), and \"Tender Buttons\" (2005); Keenan wrote the latter while her father was dying of cancer in 2008. Also released in 2009 was the collaboration album \"Broadcast and The Focus Group Investigate Witch Cults of the Radio Age\", which the group wrote and recorded with The Focus Group, an English experimental band.\\n\\nKeenan lived in and near Birmingham throughout her life, and her music career was based there. In an interview with \"Billboard\", she said: \"There\\'s really a down tone in Birmingham. People here definitely underplay themselves. There\\'s definitely a lack of confidence, and almost a resignation and defeatism among musicians here.\"\\n\\nSection::::Artistry.\\nSection::::Musical style.\\nKeenan possessed a contralto vocal range. Music critics noted Keenan\\'s vocals as \"childlike\" and \"alluringly aloof,\" often \"woven within squishy analog synths, pastoral melodies, and mod-style rhythms.\" In a review published in \"Spin\" in 2001, Keenan\\'s vocals and instrumentation alongside bandmate James Cargill were likened to being \"stuck in a time warpâthe sound of \\'70s wife-swapping parties with beanbags and unhappy children serving sausages on sticks.\" Keenan often explored cut-up lyric techniques, inspired partly by her interest in the occult. \\n\\nSection::::Performances.\\nKeenan suffered from stage fright in the beginnings of her career, and earned a reputation for \"shoegazing onstage introversion.\" As the band progressed, however, Keenan\\'s stage fright receded: \"I used to get nervous like the whole of that day of the show, and now it only happens the moment I walk onstage,\" she said in a 1998 interview. \"When you listen to me sing my first line, you can always tell my heart is in my throat. Headlining gigs is a confidence booster.\"\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nDuring a tour in Australia just before Christmas, Keenan contracted the swine flu virus H1N1. It was reported on 14 January 2011 that she had died in the hospital. A statement by Warp Record Label said: \"This is an untimely, tragic loss and we will miss Trish dearly - a unique voice, an extraordinary talent and a beautiful human being. Rest in peace.\"\\n\\nWithin hours of her death, a link was posted on Broadcast\\'s Twitter to a mix of psychedelic, folk, and world music that Keenan had made for a friend prior to leaving for the band\\'s Australian tour. Shortly after, an intimate short film Keenan recorded on Super 8 was released, which showed festival-goers at the 2007 Moseley Folk festival. Tributes to Keenan were made from numerous musicians, including Toro y Moi, Graham Coxon of Blur, and Colin Meloy of The Decemberists.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Trish Keenan', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7866339'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'EwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7866937', 'text': 'British Virgin Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics\\n\\nThe British Virgin Islands competed at the 1996 Summer Olympics in Atlanta, United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'British Virgin Islands at the 1996 Summer Olympics', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7866937'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7867586', 'text': 'Home Again (New Edition album)\\n\\nHome Again is the sixth studio album by American R&B/pop group New Edition. Released on September 10, 1996, it is the only album to date to feature all six members of New EditionâBobby Brown, who\\'d left the group in 1985, rejoined the lineupâand was their final recording for MCA Records. Highly anticipated, and being their first album since, \"Heart Break\" (1988), the album debuted on the US \"Billboard\" 200 at number one, becoming the group\\'s first album to open at number one, selling 441,000 in its first week sales. It also topped the Irish Albums Chart, and the US \"Billboard\" R&B Albums Chart as the group\\'s first album in twelve years to do so since their self titled album in 1984. The album\\'s success spawned four singles which collectively received moderate \"Billboard\" chart success. It was certified double platinum by the RIAA, for sales and shipments of over two million copies on February 4, 1997.\\n\\nSection::::Overview.\\nSection::::History.\\nAfter the successful 1988 album, \"Heart Break\", the lineup of New Edition: Ralph Tresvant, Johnny Gill, Ricky Bell, Ronnie DeVoe, and Michael Bivins decided to go on hiatus as a group in order to pursue separate interests. With the exception of a surprise reunion of all six New Edition members performing at the MTV Video Music Awards in 1990, and song and music video for Bell Biv DeVoeâs 1991 single \"Word to the Mutha!\" (which featured Brown, Gill, and Tresvant), the group largely went their separate ways for the first half of the 1990s.\\n\\nUpon the advice of producers Jimmy Jam & Terry Lewis, Bell, Bivins and DeVoe formed their own trio, Bell Biv DeVoe. Their album \"Poison\", released in 1990, sold over three million copies. The same year, Johnny Gillâwho had had a solo career before joining New Editionârevived it with his multi-platinum self-titled album. Also in 1990, Ralph Tresvant released his long-awaited solo debut album, which too went multi-platinum. In the mix, Bobby Brown, whose 1988 album, \"Don\\'t Be Cruel\", had sold over eight million copies, continued his success with the triple-platinum \"Bobby\" album in 1992. By this point, the group members were becoming as known for their side projects as they were as New Edition. Though when pressed by fans and journalists, the now fragmented band mates intermittently assured that they had planned to reunite to record another New Edition album, years passed before such plans were put into action, leaving their fans to wonder if their 1988 album, \"Heart Break\", was in fact the group\\'s swan song.\\n\\nHowever, by 1995, many of New Edition\\'s subsequent solo projects were not as successful as their first ventures. Meanwhile, the year had been notable for Bobby Brownâwho\\'d gained more media attention not for his music, but for his tumultuous marriage to Whitney Houston, and various troubles with the law. The same year, Bell, Bivins, DeVoe, Gill, and Tresvant decided to come together and begin production on the long-awaited, long-promised sixth New Edition album. Despite his notorious reputation and worldwide tabloid fodder, the group invited Brown (who had not been featured on a New Edition album since 1985\\'s \"All for Love\") back to join them, to which he agreed.\\n\\nSection::::Release and reaction.\\nNew Editionâs first new album in eight years, \"Home Again\", was released in September 1996âdebuting at number one on both the Billboard Top 200 and the Top R&B/Hip-Hop album chart. The first single, \"Hit Me Off\", peaked at number one on the R&B chart and reached number three on the pop chart. Another top ten hit, \"I\\'m Still in Love With You\" was released toward years end. Other hits include: \"You Don\\'t Have to Worry\" and \"One More Day\". Another song \"Shop Around\" was not released as a single, but still found moderate airplay on R&B stations. \"Home Again\" went on to be certified double platinum, with sales of over two million, and became the groups greatest commercial success. The group originally recorded twenty songs for the project.\\n\\nHowever, their reunion tour was tainted by some of the members\\' egos. One evening as Brown extended his solo set, Ronnie DeVoe attempted to pull Brown off the stage. Eventually, Brown responded by dropping his microphone and a fist fight between the two ensued. This led to both members\\' security guards confronting each other, gun play was brought in, and the concert was halted. Bivins and Brown left the tour early, while DeVoe, Bell, Gill and Tresvant finished out the rest of the tour as a quartet. Brown later admitted during an interview that he was intoxicated during the tour.\\n\\nSection::::Track listing.\\nNotes\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Home Again (New Edition album)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7867586'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'FQE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7868248', 'text': \"Ola Dybwad-Olsen\\n\\nOla Dybwad-Olsen (born August 4, 1946 in Oslo) is a former Norwegian footballer who played as a striker for Lyn, StabÃ¦k and Norway.

Leitz\\'s activities intensified after the Kristallnacht of November 1938, during which synagogues and Jewish shops were burned across Germany.\\n\\nGerman \"employees\" disembarking from the ocean liner \"Bremen\" at a New York pier went to Leitz\\'s Manhattan office, where they were helped to find jobs. Each new arrival was given a Leica camera. The refugees were paid a stipend until they could find work. Out of this migration came designers, repair technicians, salespeople, marketers and writers for the photographic press. The \"Leica Freedom Train\" was at its height in 1938 and early 1939, delivering groups of refugees to New York every few weeks until the invasion of Poland on September 1, 1939, when Germany closed its borders.\\n\\nLeitz was an internationally recognized brand that reflected credit on the newly resurgent Reich. The company produced range-finders and other optical systems for the German military. Also, the Nazi government urgently needed hard currency from abroad, and Leitz\\'s single biggest market for optical goods was the United States. Even so, members of the Leitz family and firm suffered for their good works. A top executive, Alfred Turk, was jailed for working to help Jews and freed only after the payment of a large bribe.\\n\\nLeitz\\'s daughter, Elsie Kuhn-Leitz, was imprisoned by the Gestapo after she was caught at the border, helping Jewish women cross into Switzerland. She eventually was freed but endured rough treatment in the course of questioning. She also fell under suspicion when she attempted to improve the living conditions of 700 to 800 Ukrainian slave laborers, all of them women, who had been assigned to work in the plant during the 1940s.\\n\\nSection::::Awards and commemoration.\\nAfter the war, Elsie Kuhn-Leitz received numerous honors for her humanitarian efforts, among them the Officier d\\'honneur des Palmes AcadÃ©miques from France in 1965 and the Aristide Briand Medal from the European Academy in the 1970s and Courage to Care Award from the Anti-Defamation League. According to Norman Lipton, a freelance writer and editor, the Leitz family wanted no publicity for its heroic efforts. Only after the last member of the Leitz family was dead did the \"Leica Freedom Train\" finally come to light. It is the subject of a book, \"The Greatest Invention of the Leitz Family: The Leica Freedom Train\" (American Photographic Historical Society, New York, 2002) by Frank Dabba Smith, a California-born rabbi currently living in England. In 2007, Ernst Leitz II was awarded posthumously the Courage To Care Award by the Anti-Defamation League.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Leica Freedom Train', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7873640'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'GwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7874008', 'text': 'Mimi Gibson\\n\\nMimi Gibson (born October 19, 1948) is a former child actress.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nAfter the early death of her father, her mother took her and her sister to Los Angeles. At only 18 months, she was a popular calendar model, posing with cute animals. By age two she was appearing in movies. \\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nDuring the 1950s and early 1960s she would appear in 34 movies and approximately 200 television episodes. Her last TV roles came as a teenage girlfriend in episodes of \"My Three Sons\" in the late 1960s. Her last film role was in \"If He Hollers\". \\n\\nIn 1957 she and child actress Evelyn Rudie played the daughters of John Wayne and Maureen O\\'Hara in \"The Wings of Eagles\". Although they had some significant scenes, she and Rudie were not credited. The same year she was in the horror B-movie \"The Monster That Challenged the World\".\\n\\nIn 1958 she had a role as Cary Grant\\'s daughter â with Paul Petersen and Charles Herbert playing her brothers â in the light romantic comedy \"Houseboat\", which also starred Sophia Loren. Gibson said, \"I\\'d like to be remembered for \"Houseboat\".\" She said \"\"Houseboat\" was fun, wonderful and I loved it\".\\n\\nThey filmed \"Houseboat\" for a month on location in Washington, D.C. The actual houseboat was on the Virginia (or south) side of the Potomac River. The scene at the amusement park was filmed at Glen Echo Amusement Park, on the northern side of the river. When the movie was completed, Loren gave Gibson a pendant with a houseboat on one side and \"To Mimi from Sophia\" on the other. Grant gave each of the children a $50 savings bond, a large sum in those days.\\n\\nIn 1961 she appeared in \"The Children\\'s Hour\", based on the play by Lillian Hellman. Gibson played a schoolgirl at a private school run by Audrey Hepburn and Shirley MacLaine. The movie involved accusations of a lesbian relationship between the co-stars\\' characters and was somewhat daring for its time. She said Hepburn was very nice to the girls, but that \"Shirley MacLaine despised kids.\" She would not even speak to them. That same year, she was also in \"One Hundred and One Dalmatians\" alongside Mickey Maga, Barbara Baird, Sandra Abbot, and several other children. Gibson became known for this film for her line, \"I\\'m tired and I\\'m hungry and my tail\\'s froze...and my nose is froze and my ears are froze. And my toes are froze.\"\\n\\nOn television, Gibson appeared in five \"Playhouse 90\" dramas and many episodes of \"The Red Skelton Show\", as well as some episodes of \"Whirlybirds\" and \"Leave it to Beaver\".\\n\\nHaving worked since age 2 1/2, by nineteen, Mimi, along with many of her acting friends, found it hard to get roles because they were overexposed, and the casting directors were looking for \"new faces\". So, she went into retail and then became a realtor in the Los Angeles area. Mimi\\'s income as an actress was the sole support of her family and no money was set aside for her. Mimi has been married three times, the last marriage lasting almost thirty years.\\n\\nIn 1999 she testified before a California legislative panel on the need for statutory protection for child actors\\' earnings. She did this with Paul Petersen, who played her older brother in \"Houseboat\". Petersen has remained a lifelong friend and is the founder in 1990 of \"A Minor Consideration\", a nonprofit group devoted to protecting and advancing the interests of child actors. Gibson has also been active in this group.\\n', 'title': 'Mimi Gibson', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7874008'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'HAE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7877318', 'text': 'Saner Wonggoun\\n\\nFormer Technical Sergeant Saner Wonggoun (; ; born January 22, 1947) is a Thai American who was the United States Air Force\\'s top fugitive from 1994 to 2006 as the principal suspect in his wife\\'s killing. After his November 2006 capture in a Thai market, Wonggoun unsuccessfully fought extradition and eventually pleaded guilty toâand was convicted ofâvoluntary manslaughter by court-martial.\\n\\nWonggoun was in federal prison until July, 2013.\\n\\nSection::::Immigration and enlistment.\\nBorn in Nakhon Nayok, Thailand, Saner Wonggoun moved to the United States at the age of 21 and enlisted in the Air Force in 1976. He gained United States citizenship in 1978, having dual citizenship with his home nation of Thailand.\\n\\nSection::::Desertion and capture.\\nAssigned to and living on Travis Air Force Base as an air cargo supervisor in January 1994, Wonggoun fled the country on January 14 when wanted for questioning by the authorities of Marin County, California. The sergeant was the primary suspect in the killing of his wife of 12 years (conflicting reports give 13), 42-year-old Sopha Wonggoun (nÃ©e Yodpet).\\n\\nHis wife\\'s body had been found a week earlier on January 7, 1994 wrapped in a sleeping bag along a deserted road off State Route 1. At the time of the killing, the couple had two children already and Sopha was eight-months pregnant. An autopsy later determined Sopha died of \"blunt force trauma to the head ... consistent with the shape of a hammer.\"\\n\\nIn the three to four days it took to identify the victim and obtain a search warrant for the Wonggouns\\' mobile home, Saner had received emergency leave and flew to Thailandâleaving his vehicle in the short-term parking at San Francisco International Airport.\\n\\nHeading the investigation, the Air Force Office of Special Investigations (AFOSI) named Sergeant Wonggoun their number one fugitive; and, in October 2006, offered age-progressed images and a US$25,000 reward for information leading to Wonggoun\\'s capture. On November 3, following a tip-off by a Thai woman that Wonggoun was selling charcoal at the Khoke Matoom Market, the Royal Thai Police arrested Wonggoun in Phitsanulok Province.\\n\\nAfter his arrest, Wonggoun made several statements that were later published in the \"Phuket Gazette\". He allegedly confessed to killing his wife, admitting to bludgeoning her with a hammer after learning she was eight months pregnantâdespite living chaste with Wonggoun for almost a year. Saner further claimed that his wife had an addiction to gambling and had wasted a lot of money in this fashion. After fleeing the United States in 1994, Wonggoun never withdrew any of his US$81,700 for fear of being traced, nor was he aware that his son had made frequent trips to Thailand searching for him. Summarizing his time as a fugitive, Wonggoun claimed to have attempted suicide several times: \"I have been living in misery all along. I have been living on given time. No happiness or anything at all.\"\\n\\nSection::::Extradition.\\nCaptain Christine Millette with the AFOSI said Wonggoun would be court-martialed on charges of premeditated murder; the Uniform Code of Military Justice dictates a potential sentence of death or life imprisonment should he be convicted for the murder of his wife.\\n\\nAfter his arrest, Wonggoun insisted he be considered a Thai citizen and subject to Thai jurisdiction. However, in December 2007 Thailand\\'s Appeals Court found that as the killing took place in the United States, and Wonggoun is a US citizen, he was subject to the US judicial system.\\n\\nOn February 15, 2008, Wonggoun was transferred to the custody of the AFOSI Detachment 303 at Travis AFB; because OSI investigators believed that Sopha was killed on base, Marin County relinquished legal jurisdiction to the Air Force.\\n\\nSection::::Trial.\\nSection::::Article 32 hearing.\\nOn March 19, 2008, Air Force prosecutors convened an Article 32 hearing to determine whether there was probable cause that a crime occurred and that Wonggoun committed it. During the two-day hearing, the prosecution and defense counsels (Majors Tara Villena and Mark Etheridge, respectively) questioned the original Marin County investigator, Detective Steven Nash, and Wonggoun\\'s 21-year-old daughter, Sophia Wonggoun Burtram.\\n\\nBurtram testified that she may have inadvertently informed her father about her mother\\'s boyfriend shortly before her death. When questioned by the defense counsel, she supported the argument for voluntary manslaughter, testifying that she had never seen her father act violently or aggressively toward her mother.\\n\\nThe evidence, testimony, and arguments of counsel were reviewed by the proceeding\\'s investigating officer, Colonel Steven Ehlenbeck., who found probable cause.\\n\\nSection::::Court-martial.\\nProceeding to court-martial, Wonggoun requested a court trial as opposed to a military jury panel. On July 28, 2008 the court martial began with Wonggoun pleading guilty to voluntary manslaughter. Wonggoun explained that he understood the ramifications of his plea, and detailed the killing upon questioning by the presiding Judge, Colonel William Burd.\\n\\nReiterating some of his November 2006 comments, Wonggoun explained that the January 6, 1994 killing was not planned, and resulted from an argument. According to Wonggoun, not only had his wife accrued over US$20,000 in gambling debts, but on the day of the killing, he learned that Sopha was pregnant and he was \"100 percent\" sure the child wasn\\'t his. Retrieving a claw hammer from his storage room, \"... I hit her one time and she fell on the floor, and after that I realized what I did, I lost control of myself ... everything was just dark.\" Wonggoun explained to Colonel Burd that it was never his intention to kill his wife, but that \"I was mad. I wanted to teach her a lesson.\" Arguing for a verdict of voluntary manslaughter, defense attorneys showed that Wonggoun\\'s own frank candidness about the killing, as well as his \"[anger], being in the sudden heat of passion, [was] the only explanation.\"\\n\\nDespite Wonggoun\\'s plea, Air Force prosecutors proceeded with a charge of premeditated murder. TSgt Don Osborn explained that unlike a civilian trial, \"it\\'s not like a plea bargain. He doesn\\'t get to choose.\" Major Villena argued that the couple\\'s money problems were the motive for premeditation, and that Wonggoun had been disturbed about his wife\\'s problems for some time beforehand: \"He\\'s not going from 0 to 100 in two seconds.\" Further, Wonggoun\\'s methodical and systematic cleanup and disposal of his wife\\'s body evidenced calculation beyond a sudden decision to kill.\\n\\nSection::::Conviction, sentencing and imprisonment.\\nOn July 30, 2008, Colonel Burd found Wonggoun guilty of voluntary manslaughter, and imposed a sentence of 10 years military confinement, a dishonorable discharge, forfeiture of all pay and allowances, and a reduction in rank to Airman Basic (E-1). On April 27, 2010, a panel of the Air Force Court of Criminal Appeals affirmed the conviction and sentence; the Court of Appeals for the Armed Forces later denied review.

Sunset High is considered one of the premier high schools in Beverly Hills and many of the students who attend there are the offspring of those who work in the entertainment industry, one of the biggest employers in Los Angeles and its claim to fame.\\n\\nA few of the students (Monica Miller for example) are stars themselves. Some kids, though, are from more conventional and ordinary families. One of the students, Josh Ross, attends Sunset due to his mom working at the school as the school nurse (His family lived in nearby Culver City, California).\\n\\nThe story begins when Kristin Sullivan, a Junior who is from St. Cloud, Minnesota with her parents, Garth and Lila Sullivan and her younger brother, Shawn, arrives at Sunset High.

Its patients enjoyed a bowling alley, private rooms, recreational activities, jobs within the hospital, some even being able to leave regularly. The entire complex consisted of 23 buildings, the largest being the Acute Intensive Care Center, named Hilltop (building 4). The facility also contained a boiler plant, garage, warehouse, administration building, recreation building, five extended treatment wards, two geriatric wards, and two kitchen buildings. At the time of its closure in 1998, its superintendent was Aidan Altenor. Its closure was due in part to a lawsuit using the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 as well as the general deinstitutionalization of the state hospital system.

The first buildings to come down were the administration and recreation buildings, followed by the extended treatment and geriatric wards. The final two buildings to be demolished were the boiler plant, and the five story Hilltop building which finally fell on January 17, 2008. Currently, the upper portion of the property is being developed into housing, while the lower portion was developed into athletic and recreation areas for the township. The vast woods surrounding the property to the south and west have been allowed to remain. The Reserve now boasts over 5 miles of hiking trails, an all accessible playground built completely by volunteers call Freedom Playground, a dog park with a section for each small and large dogs, two grass fields, one synthetic turf soccer/football/lacrosse field, one synthetic turf baseball/softball diamond, and the Community Recreation & Environmental Center.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Haverford State Hospital', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7888003'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'JgE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7888242', 'text': 'Mandrake Root\\n\\n\"Mandrake Root\" is a song by Deep Purple that is featured on their debut album \"Shades of Deep Purple\". The title is in reference to the mandrake plant, but is also the name of a pre-Purple band that Blackmore was trying to form in Germany when he got the call from Deep Purple\\'s original management.\\n\\nSection::::Recording.\\nDeep Purple recorded their first studio album in May 1968. Of the eight songs that were included, (an additional one, \"Shadows\", was cut as a demo but scrapped from the album), only four of them were written by the band itself. Additionally, one of these songs, \"And the Address\", is an instrumental. The studio version of \"Mandrake Root\" is just over six minutes long. Many full recordings of the live arrangement exceed the twenty-minute mark.\\n\\n\"Mandrake Root\" was performed and recorded at the same time as their first instrumental, \"And the Address\", and was originally meant to be an instrumental as well. The lyrics weren\\'t added until after rehearsals took place before the album-recording of \"Shades of Deep Purple\" in May, 1968, the group having decided that they did not want more than one instrumental track on the album. It was recorded on Sunday, 12 May. The song features many sound effects, which were picked from the BBC Library.\\n\\nSection::::Writing.\\nThe song has a rather controversial writing history. Though it is officially credited to Rod Evans, Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore, according to Jerry Bloom\\'s unauthorized biography of Ritchie Blackmore, the chord progression and melody were first written by a guy called Bill Parkinson and named \"Lost Soul\". The song was conceived as a drum solo for Carlo Little (Rolling Stones\\' original drummer), who like Blackmore had played with The Savages, the backing band for Screaming Lord Sutch. Simper said Blackmore learned the melody \"note for note\" from Little. Bill Parkinson was lead guitarist with the Savages Jul-Sep 1966, while Blackmore had played with Sutch May-Oct 1962, Feb-May 1965 and Dec 1966-Apr 1967, so their paths had clearly crossed. As this song, along with \"Hush,\" pushed the fledgeling band sky high, it wasn\\'t surprising that word about it got back to Parkinson. Not happy with regard \"to what he saw as the rip-off\" of \"Lost Soul,\" Parkinson turned up on Simper\\'s doorstep to complain. He threatened court action to Simper, who at that time already left Deep Purple but agreed with some reluctance to testify for him. \"But,\" Simper said, \"...I never saw Bill again. Apparently they paid him off with about Â£600.\"\\n\\nSection::::Live performances.\\nThe song would become an early concert staple for the band, with the keyboard and guitar solos extended at times for up to 15 minutes. One of the few Mk I era songs to continue being played by Mk II and sung by Ian Gillan, a similar instrumental would be paired in later years with the extended live versions of \"Space Truckin\\'.\" In the version of \"Space Truckin\\'\" recorded for the 1972 live \"Made In Japan\" album, riffs from \"Mandrake Root\" can be plainly heard during the instrumental parts.\\n\\nIt is one of the few Mk I tracks that was a regular feature of Mk II\\'s early setlist, as it provided a vehicle for lengthy organ and guitar solos from Jon Lord and Ritchie Blackmore, respectively. It is also one of two Deep Purple songs that were written by the Mk I lineup, and later re-worked by Ian Gillan for Mk II. The other one is \"Bird Has Flown,\" originally featured on the album \"Deep Purple\" from 1969.\\n\\nFor the guitar solo, Blackmore would frequently throw his guitar into the air, play it with his feet, or perform similar crowd pleasing tricks.\\n', 'title': 'Mandrake Root', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=7888242'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'JwE2_GoBuVOJh6rZXb56', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '7888774', 'text': 'Delaine Buses\\n\\nDelaine Buses is a bus operator based in Bourne, Lincolnshire, England.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn 1890 William Smith began a horse drawn passenger service.

In 2015 a CNN story reported that the mall had begun to attract tenants after extensive renovations and remodeling, though large portions still remained vacant. According to another article published in January 2018, after more than a decade of high vacancy, most retail spaces had been filled and the mall featured an IMAX-style cinema and theme park. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe mall was built on former farmlands in the Wanjiang District of Dongguan in southern coastal China. The project was spearheaded by Hu Guirong (Alex Hu), who became a billionaire in the instant noodle industry. Upon opening, South China Mall became the largest mall in the world, surpassing the Golden Resources Mall. The cost of its construction is estimated around $1.3 billion.\\n\\nThe mall was owned by Dongguan Sanyuan Yinghui Investment & Development (ä¸èå¸ä¸åçææèµåå±æéå¬å¸), Hu Guirong\\'s company, but a controlling interest in the mall was later sold to Founder Group, a division of Peking University.\\nAfter opening in 2005, the mall suffered from a severe lack of occupants. Targeted initially to an affluent market (the big cities of Guangzhou and Shenzhen are adjacent), Dongguan is itself mainly a city of low income migrant laborers who failed to respond to all the attractions the mall had to offer. Much of the retail space remained empty, with over 99% of the stores still vacant in 2008. The only occupied areas were near the entrance where several Western fast food chains are located and a parking structure re-purposed as a kart racing track. A planned Shangri-La Hotel was not completed.\\n\\nFilmmaker Sam Green made a short film about the South China Mall called \"Utopia Part 3: the World\\'s Largest Shopping Mall\" which premiered at the 2009 Sundance Film Festival and was broadcast on PBS\\'s documentary series \"POV\".\\n\\nOriginally called \"South China Mall\", the centre was redubbed as \"New South China Mall, Living City\" in September 2007. The 2007 makeover was orchestrated by Founder Group, which took over the property from the original owner Hu Guirong in December 2006.\\n\\nIn 2013, \"Vagabond Journey\" writer Wade Shepard wrote about his recent visit to the mall. He acknowledged that most visitors attend the mall for its movie theaters featuring IMAX, and that families did gather in the play area. He also noticed that 4 full floors of the mall were unused, and that the water of the artificial indoor canals had turned green.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\nIts total area is , with almost of leasable space sufficient for as many as 2,350 stores.\\n\\nThe mall has seven zones modeled on international cities, nations and regions, including Amsterdam, Paris, Rome, Venice, Egypt, the Caribbean, and California.

In 1936 the power station was acquired by RWE and after extension work the output raised to 26 MW.\\nAfter World War II demolitions the power station was back in operation 1946. After further enhancement an output of 90MW was reached in 1951. \\n\\nIn 1954 this was replaced with a much larger plant \"Frimmersdorf II\" which contained initially two 100 MW units. Over the next 15 years, this was incrementally upgraded until it supported an additional twelve 150 MW units and two 300 MW units. In 1970 the final configuration of Frimmersdorf II was reached and the power station held the record of the world largest thermal power station. \\n\\n1988 saw the installation of Flue-gas desulfurization scrubbers, while the two 100 MW units were shut down on 30 June. \\nStarting in 2005 most of the units have been shut down until 2013. Their workload has mainly been replaced by new 1100MW units in the neighbouring Neurath Power Station. The two remaining 300MW units are planned to be shut down by October 2017.
