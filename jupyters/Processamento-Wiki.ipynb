The war was punctuated by widely separated battles, and began with England\\'s military expedition in 1585 to what was then the Spanish Netherlands under the command of the Earl of Leicester in support of the resistance of the States General to Spanish Habsburg rule.\\n\\nThe English enjoyed some victories at Cádiz in 1587, and saw the Spanish Armada retreat in 1588, but then suffered severe defeats of the English Armada in 1589 and the Drake–Hawkins and Essex–Raleigh expeditions in 1595 and 1597 respectively. Two further Spanish armadas were sent in 1596 and 1597 but were frustrated in their objectives mainly because of adverse weather and poor planning.\\n\\nThe war became deadlocked around the turn of the 17th century during campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland. It was brought to an end with the Treaty of London, negotiated in 1604 between representatives of the new King of Spain, Philip III, and the new King of England, James I. England and Spain agreed to cease their military interventions in the Spanish Netherlands and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas privateering.\\n\\nSection::::Causes.\\nIn the 1560s, Philip II of Spain was faced with increasing religious disturbances as Protestantism gained adherents in his domains in the Low Countries. As a defender of the Catholic Church, he sought to suppress the rising Protestant heresy in his territories, which eventually exploded into open rebellion in 1566. Meanwhile, relations with the regime of Elizabeth I of England continued to deteriorate, following her restoration of royal supremacy over the Church of England through the Act of Supremacy in 1559; this had been first instituted by her father Henry VIII and rescinded by her sister Mary I. The Act was considered by Catholics as a usurpation of papal authority. Calls by leading English Protestants to support the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip increased tensions further as did the Catholic-Protestant disturbances in France, which saw both sides supporting the opposing French factions.\\nComplicating matters were commercial disputes. The activities of English sailors, begun by Sir John Hawkins in 1562, gained the tacit support of Elizabeth, even though the Spanish government complained that Hawkins\\'s trade with their colonies in the West Indies constituted smuggling. In September 1568, a slaving expedition led by Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake was surprised by the Spanish, and several ships were captured or sunk at the Battle of San Juan de Ulúa near Veracruz in New Spain. This engagement soured Anglo-Spanish relations and in the following year the English detained several treasure ships sent by the Spanish to supply their army in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their privateering as a way to break the Spanish monopoly on Atlantic trade. Francis Drake went on a privateering voyage where he eventually circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1580. Spanish colonial ports were plundered and a number of ships were captured including the treasure galleon \"Nuestra Señora de la Concepción\". When news of his exploits reached Europe, Elizabeth\\'s relations with Philip continued to deteriorate.\\n\\nSoon after the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, English support was provided to Prior of Crato who then fought in his struggle with Philip II for the Portuguese throne. Philip in return began to support the Catholic rebellion in Ireland against Elizabeth\\'s religious reforms. Both Philip\\'s and Elizabeth\\'s attempts to support opposing factions were defeated.\\n\\nIn 1584, Philip signed the Treaty of Joinville with the Catholic League of France to stop the rise of Protestantism there. In the Spanish Netherlands, England had secretly supported the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who were fighting for independence from Spain. In 1584, the Prince of Orange had been assassinated, leaving a sense of alarm as well as a political vacuum. The following year was a further blow to the Dutch with the capture of Antwerp by Spanish forces led by Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma. The Dutch rebels sought help from England, which Elizabeth agreed to as she feared that a Spanish reconquest there would threaten England. The Treaty of Nonsuch was signed as a result – Elizabeth agreed to provide the Dutch with men, horses, and subsidies but she declined overall sovereignty. In return the Dutch handed over four Cautionary Towns which were garrisoned by English troops. Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands.\\n\\nSection::::War.\\nThe Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of English merchant ships in Spanish harbors. In response the English privy council immediately authorised a campaign against the Spanish fishing industry in Newfoundland and off the Grand Banks. The campaign was a huge success, and subsequently led to England\\'s first sustained activity in the Americas. In August, England joined the Eighty Years\\' War on the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who had declared their independence from Spain.\\n\\nThe Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Drake sailed in October to the West Indies, and in January 1586 captured and sacked Santo Domingo. The following month they did the same at Cartagena de Indias and in May sailed North to raid St. Augustine in Florida. When Drake arrived in England in July he became a national hero. In Spain however, the news was a disaster and this now further buoyed a Spanish invasion of England by King Philip.\\n\\nSection::::Dutch Revolt (1585–1587).\\nRobert Dudley, The Earl of Leicester was sent to the United Provinces in 1585 with a dignitary party and took the offer of Governor of the United Provinces. This however was met with fury from Elizabeth who had expressed no desire for any sovereignty over the Dutch. An English mercenary army had been present since the beginning of the war and was then under the command of veteran Sir John Norreys. They combined forces but were undermanned and under financed, and faced one of the most powerful armies in Europe led by the famed Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma.\\n\\nDuring the siege of Grave the following year Dudley attempted its relief but the Dutch garrison commander Hadewij van Hemert surrendered the town to the Spanish. Dudley was furious on hearing of Grave\\'s sudden loss and had van Hemert executed, which shocked the Dutch. The English force then had some successes - taking Axel in July and Doesburg the following month. Dudley’s poor diplomacy with the Dutch however made matters worse. His political base weakened and so too did the military situation. Outside Zutphen an English force was defeated in which notable poet Philip Sidney was mortally wounded, which was a huge blow to English morale. Zutphen itself and Deventer were betrayed by catholic turncoats William Stanley and Rowland York which further damaged Leicester\\'s reputation. Finally Sluis with a largely English garrison was besieged and taken by the Duke of Parma in June 1587 after the Dutch refused to help in the relief. This resulted in mutual recriminations between Leicester and the States.\\n\\nLeicester soon realised how dire his situation was and then asked to be recalled. He resigned his post as Governor - his tenure was a military and political failure, and as a result he was financially ruined. After Leicester\\'s departure, the Dutch elected the Prince of Orange\\'s son Count Maurice of Nassau as the Stadtholder and Governor. At the same time Peregrine Bertie took over English forces in the Netherlands.\\n\\nSection::::Spanish Armada.\\nOn 8 February 1587, the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots outraged Catholics in Europe, and her claim on the English throne passed (by her own deed of will) to Philip. In retaliation for the execution of Mary, Philip vowed to invade England to place a Catholic monarch on its throne. In April 1587 Philip\\'s preparations suffered a setback when Francis Drake burned 37 Spanish ships in the harbour of Cádiz, and as a result the invasion of England had to be postponed for over a year.\\n\\nOn 29 July, Philip obtained Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been excommunicated by Pope Pius V, and place whomever he chose on the throne of England. He assembled a fleet of about 130 ships, containing 8,000 soldiers and 18,000 sailors. To finance this endeavour, Pope Sixtus V had permitted Philip to collect crusade taxes. Sixtus had promised a further subsidy to the Spanish should they reach English soil.\\n\\nOn 28 May 1588, the Armada under the command of Duke of Medina Sidonia set sail for the Netherlands, where it was to pick up additional troops for the invasion of England. As the armada sailed through the English channel, the English navy led by Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham and Francis Drake fought a battle of attrition with the Spanish from Plymouth to Portland and then to the Solent, preventing them from securing any English harbours. The Spanish were forced to withdraw to Calais. While the Spanish were at anchor there in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, the English used fireships to break the formation and scatter the Spanish ships. In the subsequent Battle of Gravelines the English navy inflicted a defeat on the Armada and forced it to sail northward in more dangerous stormy waters on the long way home. As they sailed around Scotland, the Armada suffered severe damage and loss of life from stormy weather. As they approached the West coast of Ireland more damaging stormy conditions forced ships ashore while others were wrecked. Disease took a heavy toll as the fleet finally limped back to port.\\n\\nPhilip\\'s invasion plans had miscarried partly because of unfortunate weather and his own mismanagement, and partly because the opportunistic defensive naval efforts of the English and their Dutch allies prevailed. The defeat of the Armada provided valuable seafaring experience for English oceanic mariners. While the English were able to persist in their privateering against the Spanish and continue sending troops to assist Philip II\\'s enemies in the Netherlands and France, these efforts brought few tangible rewards. One of the most important effects of the event was that the Armada\\'s failure was seen as a sign that God supported the Protestant Reformation in England. One of the medals struck to celebrate the English victory bore the Latin/Hebrew inscription \"Flavit יהוה et Dissipati Sunt\" (literally: \"Yahweh blew and they were scattered\"; traditionally translated more freely as: \"He blew with His winds, and they were scattered\".)\\n\\nSection::::English Armada.\\nAn English counter armada under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys was prepared in 1589 to torch the Spanish Atlantic navy, which was refitting in Santander, Corunna and San Sebastián in northern Spain. It was also intended to capture the incoming Spanish treasure fleet and expel the Spanish from Portugal (ruled by Philip since 1580) in favour of the Prior of Crato. The English fleet departed from\\xa0Plymouth\\xa0on\\xa0April 13 but was then delayed for nearly two weeks by bad weather. Drake as a result had to bypass Santander where the majority of the Spanish fleet were being refitted.\\n\\nOn May 4, the English force eventually arrived at Corunna where the lower town was captured and plundered, and a number of merchant ships were seized. Norreys then won a modest victory over a Spanish relief militia force at Puente del Burgo. When the English pressed the attack on the citadel, however, they were repulsed. In addition a number of English ships were captured by Spanish naval forces. With the failure to capture Corunna the English departed and headed towards Lisbon, but owing to poor organisation and lack of co-ordination (they had very few siege guns) the invading force also failed to take Lisbon. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialised. With Portuguese and Spanish reinforcements arriving the English retreated and headed North where Drake sacked and burned Vigo. Sickness then struck the expedition, and finally a portion of the fleet led by Drake headed towards the Azores, which was then scattered in a storm. Drake then took the best part of the fleet and plundered Porto Santo in Madeira before they limped back to Plymouth.\\n\\nThe English Armada was arguably misconceived and ended in failure overall. In the end, Elizabeth sustained a severe loss to her treasury.\\n\\nSection::::Dutch Revolt (1588–1595).\\nSoon after the defeat of the Armada, the Duke of Parma\\'s force stood down from the invasion. In the autumn Parma moved his force North towards Bergen op Zoom and then attempted to besiege the English-held town with a substantial force. The English in a ruse however managed to repel the Spanish and forced Parma\\'s retreat with heavy losses which boosted both Dutch and English morale. The following year Bertie under orders from the Queen left for France with a force to help the Protestants in their fight against the Catholic League. Sir Francis Vere assumed command of English forces thereafter - a position he retained during fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success.\\nIn 1590 an Anglo-Dutch force under Maurice and Vere respectively launched a campaign with the aim of taking Breda. In a remarkable feat a small assault force hid in a peat barge before a successful surprise assault that captured the city. With Spanish forces in France supporting the Catholic League as well as in the Low Countries, Maurice was able to take advantage, and thus started the gradual recapture of the Netherlands. This was known by the Dutch as the \\'Ten glory years\\'. Soon after Breda the Anglo-Dutch retook Zutphen and Deventer which restored English prestige after their earlier betrayals. After defeating the Spanish under the Duke of Parma at Knodsenberg in 1591 a new confidence in the army took shape. English troops by this time composed nearly half of the Dutch army. The reconquest continued with Hulst, Nijmegen, Geertruidenberg, Steenwijk and Coevorden all being taken within the next two years. In 1593 a Spanish attempt led by Francisco Verdugo to recapture Coevorden ended in failure when the Anglo-Dutch under Maurice and Vere relieved the place during the Spring of 1594. Finally the capture of Groningen in the summer of 1594 resulted in the Spanish army being forced out of the Northern provinces which led to the complete restoration of the seven provinces.\\n\\nAfter these successes Elizabeth could view the high confidence in the army and renewed the treaty with the States in 1595. English troops having been given high praise by the Dutch were kept at around 4,000 men. They were to be paid for by the States and the Queen would also be repaid on the Crowns expenses in instalments until a conclusion of peace was made.\\n\\nIn 1595, Maurice\\'s campaign was resumed to retake the cities of the Twente region from the Spanish. This was delayed after Huy was besieged in March but Maurice was unable to prevent its fall. When Maurice did go on the offensive an attempt to take Grol in July ended in failure when a Spanish force under a 90 year old veteran Cristóbal de Mondragón relieved the city. Maurice then tried to make an attempt on the city of Rheinberg in September but Mondragon defeated this move at the Battle of the Lippe. Maurice was then forced to cancel further planned offensives as the bulk of his English and Scots troops were withdrawn to take part in the attack on Cadiz. The Spanish under the new commander Archduke of Austria took advantage of this lull and recaptured Hulst the following year which led to a prolonged stalemate in the campaign and delayed the reconquest.\\n\\nSection::::Naval War and Privateering.\\nIn this period of respite, the Spanish were able to refit and retool their navy, partly along English lines. The pride of the fleet were named \"The Twelve Apostles\" – twelve massive new galleons – and the navy proved itself to be far more effective than it had been before 1588. A sophisticated convoy system and improved intelligence networks frustrated English naval attempts on the Spanish treasure fleet during the 1590s. This was best demonstrated by the repulse of the squadron that was led by Effingham in 1591 near the Azores, who had intended to ambush the treasure fleet. It was in this battle that the Spanish captured the English flagship, the \"Revenge\", after a stubborn resistance by its captain, Sir Richard Grenville. Throughout the 1590s, enormous convoy escorts enabled the Spanish to ship three times as much silver as in the previous decade.\\n\\nEnglish merchant privateers or corsairs known as Elizabeth\\'s \"Sea dogs\" however enjoyed more qualified success. In the three years after the Spanish armada more than 300 prizes were taken from the Spanish with a declared total value of well over £400,000. English courtiers provided money for their own expeditions as well as others, and even Elizabeth herself would make investments. The Earl of Cumberland made a number of expeditions and a few did yield profit - his first being the Azores Voyage in 1589. Others failed however due to bad weather and his 1591 voyage ended in defeat with Spanish galleys off Berlengas. Cumberland with Sir Walter Raleigh and Martin Frobisher combined financial strength and force that led to the most successful English naval expedition of the war. Off Flores island in 1592 in a naval battle the English fleet captured a large rich Portuguese carrack, the Madre de Deus as well as having outwitted a Spanish fleet led by Alonso de Bazán. The expedition\\'s reward equalled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England\\'s royal annual revenue and yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment. These riches gave the English an excited enthusiasm to engage in this opulent commerce. Raleigh himself in 1595 went on an expedition to explore the Orinoco river in an attempt to find the mythical city of El Dorado in the process the English plundered the Spanish settlement of Trinidad. Raleigh however exaggerated the wealth there on his return to England. Supporting Raleigh with his expedition was another led by Amyas Preston and George Somers known as the Preston Somers expedition to South America notable for a daring overland assault that saw the capture of Caracas.\\n\\nMany of the expeditions were financed by famed London merchants, the most notable of these being John Watts. An expedition Watts financed to Portuguese Brazil led by James Lancaster saw the capture and plunder of Recife and Olinda - which was highly profitable for both. In response to English privateering against their merchantmen, the Spanish monarchy struck back with the \"Dunkirkers\" devastating English shipping and fishing in the largely undefended seas around England.\\n\\nBy far the most successful English privateer was Christopher Newport who was backed financially by Watts. Newport set out in 1590 to raid the Spanish West Indies and in the ensuing fight saw the defeat of an armed Spanish convoy but Newport lost his right arm in the process. Despite this Newport continued the ventures - the blockade of Western Cuba in 1591 was the most successful English privateering venture made during the war. Both Drake and Hawkins died of disease on the later 1595–96 expedition against Puerto Rico, Panama, and other targets in the Spanish Main, a severe setback in which the English suffered heavy losses in soldiers and ships despite a number of minor military victories.\\n\\nIn August 1595, a Spanish force on patrol from Brittany, led by Carlos de Amésquita, landed at and raided Cornwall, burning Penzance and several nearby villages.\\nDuring the summer of 1596, an Anglo-Dutch expedition under Elizabeth\\'s young favourite, the Earl of Essex, sacked Cádiz, causing significant loss to the Spanish fleet, leaving the city in ruins and delaying a projected descent on England. The allies were unable to capture the treasure, as the Spanish commander had time to torch the treasure ships in port, sending the treasure to the bottom of the harbour, from where it was later recovered. Despite its failure to capture the treasure fleet, the sack of Cádiz was celebrated as a national triumph comparable to the victory over the Spanish Armada, and for a time Essex\\'s prestige rivalled Elizabeth\\'s own.\\n\\nThe Crown instead of controlling and taxing its subjects, competed with them for private profit, a race it failed to win, as the great naval expeditions were on the whole unprofitable. The last of the great English naval expeditions took place in 1597, led by the Earl of Essex known as the Islands Voyage. The objective was to destroy the Spanish fleet and intercept a treasure fleet in the Azores. Neither was achieved and the expedition ended in failure, and Essex on his return was scolded by the Queen for not protecting the English coast.\\n\\nIn the final years of the war, English privateering continued despite the strengthening of Spanish navy convoys – Cumberland\\'s last expedition in 1598 to the Caribbean led to the capture of San Juan, and had succeeded where Drake had failed. Newport struck at Tobasco in 1599 while William Parker successfully raided Portobello in 1601. Finally in 1603 Christopher Cleeve struck at Santiago de Cuba and in the last raid of the war Newport plundered Puerto Caballos.\\n\\nBy the end of the war English privateering had devastated the Spanish private merchant marine. The most famous pirates lauded by English literature and propaganda tended to attack fishing vessels or boats with small value for the Spanish crown. Spanish prizes though were taken at an attritional rate; nearly 1,000 were captured by the wars end, and there was on average a declared value of approximately £100,000-£200,000 for every year of the war.<ref name =\"Hornsby/Hermann17\">Hornsby & Hermann p. 17</ref> In addition for every Spanish prize brought back, another was either burned or scuttled, and the presence of so many English corsairs even deterred Spanish merchantman from putting to sea. This all later resulted in Spanish and Portuguese commerce being carried on Dutch and English ships which in itself created competition. Nevertheless throughout the war Spain’s important treasure fleets had been kept safe by their convoy system.\\n\\nSection::::Dutch Revolt (1597–1604).\\nBy 1597, Spanish bankruptcy and the war in France gave the Anglo-Dutch an advantage. At the Battle of Turnout a Spanish force was surprised and routed - Vere and Sir Robert Sydney distinguished themselves particularly. With the Spanish distracted by the siege of Amiens in France Maurice launched an offensive in the summer. This time both Rhienberg and Greonlo were finally taken. This was followed by the capture of Bredevoort, Enschede, Ootsmarsum, Oldenzaal and finally Lingen by the end of the year. The offensive success meant that most of the Republic had been recaptured and a significant barrier had been created along the Rhine river.\\nIn 1598, the Spanish under Francisco Mendoza retook Rheinberg and Meurs in a campaign known as the \"Spanish winter of 1598-99\". Mendoza then attempted to take Bommelerwaard island but the Dutch and English under Maurice thwarted the attempt and defeated him at Zaltbommel. Mendoza retreated from the area and the defeat resulted in chaos in the Spanish army - mutinies took place and many deserted. The following year the Dutch senate led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt saw the chaos in the Spanish army and decided the time was ripe for a focal point of the war to be concentrated in Catholic Flanders. Despite a bitter dispute between Maurice and van Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch and a sizeable contingent of the English Army under Francis Vere reluctantly agreed. They used Ostend (still in Dutch hands) as a base to invade Flanders. Their aim was to conquer the privateer stronghold city of Dunkirk. In 1600 they advanced toward Dunkirk and in a pitched battle the Anglo-Dutch inflicted a rare defeat on the Tercio led Spanish army at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in which the English played a major part. Dunkirk was never attempted however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish occupied cities in the rest of the Republic took priority. Maurice\\'s force thus withdrew leaving Vere to command Ostend in the face of an imminent Spanish siege.\\n\\nWith the siege of Ostend under way, Maurice then went on the offensive on the Rhine frontier in the summer of 1600. Rheinberg and Meurs were thus retaken from the Spanish yet again, although an attempt on s\\'Hertogenbosch failed during the winter months. At Ostend in January 1602 after being reinforced, Vere faced a huge Spanish assault organised by the Archduke and in bitter fighting this was repelled with heavy losses. Vere left the city soon after and joined Maurice in the field, while Albert was replaced Ambrogio Spinola. The siege there dragged on for another two years as the Spanish attempted to take Ostend\\'s strongpoints in a costly war of attrition. Around the same time Maurice continued – his campaign Grave was retaken but Vere was severely wounded during the siege. An attempt by the Dutch and English to relieve Ostend took place in mid 1604 but the inland of port of Sluis was besieged and captured instead. Soon after the Ostend garrison finally surrendered, after a siege of nearly four years and costing thousands of lives – for the Spanish it was a pyrrhic victory.\\n\\nSection::::France.\\nNormandy added a new front in the war and the threat of another invasion attempt across the channel. In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV\\'s conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris (where he was crowned the following year), a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon.\\n\\nThe French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry\\'s accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the Peace of Vervins ending the last of the religious civil wars and the Spanish intervention with it.\\n\\nSection::::Ireland.\\nIn 1594, the Nine Years\\' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O\\'Neill and Red Hugh O\\'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined.\\n\\nAt the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.\\n\\nThe new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom. Therefore, when James came to the English throne, his first order of business was to negotiate a peace with Philip III of Spain.\\n\\nSection::::End of the war.\\nWith the end of the war in France the new King of Spain Philip III sought peace with England. By 1598 the war had become long and costly for Spain. England and Dutch republic too were war weary and both sides felt the need for peace. At the peace of Boulogne in 1600 however Spanish demands were adamantly rejected by the English and Dutch. Nevertheless, diplomatic routes were open between the Archduke of Austria and his wife Infanta Isabella (Philip\\'s sister) who differed in their policies to Philip\\'s. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations.\\n\\nSoon after victory in Ireland the following year the English navy under Richard Leveson conducted a blockade of Spain; the first of its kind. Off Portugal they sailed into Sesimbra bay where a fleet of eight Spanish galleys under Federico Spinola (brother of Ambrogio) and Álvaro de Bazán were present. Spinola had already established his base at Sluis in Flanders, and was gathering more with an intent on a potential strike against England. In June 1602 Leveson defeated the Spanish which resulted in two galleys sunk and the capture of a rich Portuguese carrack. Months later in the English channel Spinola\\'s galley fleet gathered more galleys and sailed through the English channel once more but was defeated again by an Anglo-Dutch naval squadron off the Dover straits. The result of this action forced the Spanish to cease further naval operations against England for the remainder of the war.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty and aftermath.\\nThe treaty restored the status quo ante bellum, and the terms of the treaty were favourable both to Spain and England. For Spain the treaty secured her position as a leading power in the world. Spain\\'s upgrading of the convoy system had allowed it to defend its treasure fleets and retain its New World colonies. English support for the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish king, the original cause of the war, had ended. The Spanish would then concentrate their efforts on the Dutch in order to bring them to their knees with a knockout blow. A complete abandonment of the Dutch cause however was not promised in the treaty. The English held cautionary towns in Holland on the other hand were not surrendered despite Spanish demands. The sieges of Ostend and Sluis were allowed to continue until the end of those respective campaigns. The Dutch by 1607 had in fact prevailed - the Spanish did not deliver their knock out blow they had hoped for; the Twelve Year Truce formally recognized the independence of the Republic.\\n\\nFor England the treaty made sure the Protestant reformation there had been protected, and James and his ministers refused the Spanish demand for Catholic toleration in England. After the defeat at Kinsale in 1602, the Treaty of Mellifont was concluded the following year between James I and the Irish rebels. In the subsequent London treaty Spain pledged not to support the rebels. English public opinion however showed that the peace treaty was highly unpopular and many considered it a \"humiliating peace\". Many felt that the King had abandoned the Netherlands, their old ally, in order to appease the Spanish Crown and relations with James\\'s subjects were strained in the following years.\\n\\nThe agreement was well received in Spain. Big public celebrations were held at Valladolid, the Spanish capital, where the treaty was ratified in June 1605, in the presence of a large English ambassadorial delegation led by Lord Admiral Charles Howard. Some members of the Catholic clergy however questioned Philip III\\'s arrangements with a \"heretical power\".\\n\\nThe provisions of the treaty authorised merchants and warships of both nations to operate from each other\\'s respective ports. English trade with the Spanish Netherlands (notably the city of Antwerp) and the Iberian peninsula was resumed. Spanish warships and privateers were able to use English ports as naval bases to attack Dutch shipping or to ferry troops to Flanders.\\n\\nThe war had also diverted Tudor colonial efforts, but the English who had invested in privateering expeditions during the war garnered enormous windfall profits leaving them well placed to finance new ventures. As a result the London Company were able to establish a settlement in Virginia in 1607. The establishment of the East India Company in 1600, was significant for the growth of England (and later Great Britain) as a colonial power. A factory was established at Banten, Java, in 1603 while the Company had successfully and profitably breached the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly. While the incipient illegal trade with the Spanish colonies was brought to an end, there was deadlock over English demands for the right to trade in the East and West Indies, which Spain adamantly opposed. Eventually the complications resulted in the treaty avoiding any mention of the matter.\\n\\nFor Spain there was hope that England would eventually secure tolerance for Catholics but the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 however destroyed any possibility of this. As a result it put to rest Protestant fears that a peace with Spain would ultimately mean an invasion by Jesuits and Catholic sympathisers as the Elizabethan Recusancy laws were rigidly enforced by parliament.\\n\\nEngland and Spain remained at peace until 1625.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090966'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'uhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '109097', 'text': 'Manasota Key, Florida\\n\\nManasota Key is a census-designated place (CDP) consisting mainly of the community of Englewood Beach in Charlotte County, Florida, United States.

American river pilots and fishermen came to Hazard, present-day Mayport, and established a port.\\n\\nSection::::Pablo Beach.\\nIn the late 19th century, developers began to see the potential in Duval County\\'s oceanfront as a resort. In 1883 a group of investors formed the Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad with the intention of developing a resort community that would be connected to Jacksonville by rail. The first settlers were William Edward Scull, a civil engineer and surveyor, and his wife Eleanor Kennedy Scull. They lived in a tent two blocks east of Pablo Historical Park. A second tent was the general store and post office. On August 22, 1884, Mrs. Scull was appointed postmaster. Mail was dispatched by horse and buggy up the beach to Mayport, and from there to Jacksonville by steamer. The Sculls built the first house in 1884 on their tent site. The settlement was named Ruby for their first daughter. On May 13, 1886, the town was renamed Pablo Beach after the San Pablo River. In 1885, the San Pablo Diego Beach Land Co. sold town lots ranging from $50 to $100 each along with lots from $10 to $20 per acre within of the new seaside resort \"Pablo Beach\". In September 1892, work on the wagon road to Pablo Beach (Atlantic Boulevard) was begun. The first resort hotel called the Murray Hall Hotel was established in mid 1886 but on August 7, 1890 it was destroyed in a fire. By 1900 the railway company began to have financial difficulties and Henry Flagler took over as part of his Florida East Coast Railway. In late 1900 the railway was changed to standard gauge and was extended to Mayport.\\n\\nThe Spanish–American War broke out in 1898. The 3rd Nebraska arrived July 22, 1898, for training and embarkation. They encamped at Pablo Beach. They were led by three-time presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan. After flooding in the camp at Pablo Beach the 3rd Nebraska moved to downtown Jacksonville.\\n\\nSection::::Jacksonville Beach.\\nThe amusement park phase of Jacksonville Beach began in 1905 with The Pavilion which was later expanded and called Little Coney Island. It was a popular tourist attraction that had such entertainment as a dance floor, swim room, bowling alley, and roller skate rinks. An issue with contracting and constant weathering of its wooden structure aged Little Coney Island causing it to be torn down in 1925. On June 15, 1925, the name Pablo Beach was changed to Jacksonville Beach. The Shad\\'s Pier was created in 1922 by Charles Shad and with help by Martin Williams. Around the same time W. H. Adams, Sr. created the Ocean View Pavilion amusement park on the former site of the Murray Hall Hotel. Adams wanted to create a larger roller coaster than the one at Little Coney Island. His vision resulted in a 93-feet high coaster. The location of the coaster by the beach made it vulnerable to damage and was eventually deemed unsafe. The coaster was then deconstructed to a smaller coaster. The deconstruction of the larger coaster hurt business at the amusement park. By 1949 the Ocean View Pavilion was in decline and then a fire destroyed it a few years later. The only amusement park in Jacksonville Beach today is Adventure Landing. The boardwalk declined in the 1950s due to the crackdown on gambling and games of chance. Driving on the beach was prohibited in 1979.\\n\\nPablo Beach made aviation history on February 24, 1921, Lt. Wm. DeVoe Coney, in a transcontinental flight from San Diego, California, landed at Pablo Beach, having made the flight in 22 hours and 17 minutes, beating the old record, set two years earlier, by 3 hours and 32 minutes. Coney\\'s record was soon eclipsed on September 5, 1922, by Jimmy Doolittle piloting a De Havilland DH-4 biplane from Pablo Beach to San Diego in an elapsed time of 21 hours and 19 minutes.\\n\\nIn 1968 most residents of Duval County voted to approve consolidation between the county and the City of Jacksonville. Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and the Westside community of Baldwin voted to retain their own municipal governments. As such they are not part of the City of Jacksonville, but receive county-level services from Jacksonville, and vote for Jacksonville\\'s mayor and City Council. Judy Van Zant, widow of lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd Ronnie Van Zant, and her daughter Melody opened the Freebird Cafe in 1999. Freebird Live, as it later became, was a popular music venue that became a staple for Jacksonville Beach for 16 years until its closure in 2016. In September 1999 Hurricane Floyd destroyed the Jacksonville Beach Pier. Five years later the pier was rebuilt. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew forced a mandatory evacuation for Jacksonville Beach. Hurricane Matthew came 40 miles off the coast of Jacksonville Beach causing major flooding. The Jacksonville Beach Pier was partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (66.61%) is water. Jacksonville Beach is the largest town in the Jacksonville Beaches community. It is the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 90, which ends at an intersection with State Road A1A three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. The city is located at (30.284091, -81.396074).\\n\\nSection::::Architecture.\\nIn general, the architecture of Jacksonville varies in style and is not defined by any one characteristic, and Jacksonville Beach is no exception. Designed by Marsh and Saxelbye, and completed in 1925, Casa Marina Hotel is a Mission style hotel popular in the 1920s when Jacksonville\\'s beaches were being developed. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1993. Constructed in 1947, the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps Station is an Art Moderne style lifeguard station designed by local architect Jefferson Davis Powell. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 2014. Jacksonville Beach is also home to a notable collection of Mid-Century modern architecture. Perhaps the most notable of these works are those designed by architect William Morgan.\\n\\nSection::::Climate.\\nJacksonville Beach has a humid subtropical climate.\\n\\nSection::::Parks and recreation.\\nHanna Park is a public beach and city park located near Mayport in the Jacksonville Beaches area. It consists of of mature coastal hammock, and was formerly known as Manhattan Beach, Florida\\'s first beach community for African Americans during the period of segregation in the United States.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 20,990 people, 9,715 households, and 5,207 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,732.3 inhabitants per square mile (1,055.2/km²). There were 10,775 housing units at an average density of 1,402.6 per square mile (541.7/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 90.94% White, 4.82% African American, 0.27% Native American, 1.63% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.79% from other races, and 1.51% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.99% of the population.\\n\\nThere were 9,715 households, out of which 21.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.5% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.4% were non-families. 34.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.13 and the average family size was 2.78.\\n\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 18.0% under the age of 18, 8.7% from 18 to 24, 35.6% from 25 to 44, 24.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.7 males.\\n\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $46,922, and the median income for a family was $58,388 (these figures had risen to $62,897 and $80,054 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $36,385 versus $30,055 for females. The per capita income for the city was $27,467. About 4.2% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.2% of those under age 18 and 7.0% of those age 65 or over.\\n\\nSection::::Government.\\nSince the 1968 consolidation between Duval County and the City of Jacksonville, Jacksonville Beach has been a separate municipality within the consolidated city of Jacksonville. As such, it has its own city manager, city council, and mayor, but it is subject to county-level governance by Jacksonville. The current mayor is Charlie Latham who was re-elected to a second four-year term in November 2016.\\n\\nSection::::Transportation.\\nBeach Boulevard (US 90) connects Jacksonville Beach to the Southside neighborhood of Jacksonville. It continues westward to downtown Jacksonville, via the Commodore Point Expressway and Hart Bridge. Butler Bouleveard (SR 202) begins in southeast Jacksonville at Philips Highway (US 1) and ends in southern Jacksonville Beach at 3rd Street South (SR A1A). SR A1A is a popular seaside scenic route extending from Fernandina Beach to Key West. In Jacksonville Beach it serves as the main commercial corridor, extending the length of the beachside community.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nThe Duval County Public Schools district operates public schools, including San Pablo Elementary School in Jacksonville Beach.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Jacksonville Beach, Florida', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=109150', 'cat_id': '109150', 'cat_title': 'Demographics_of_Armenia', 'cat_pages': '6', 'cat_subcats': '2', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'vxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10915749', 'text': 'Aggressive NK-cell leukemia\\n\\nAggressive NK-cell leukemia is a disease with an aggressive, systemic proliferation of natural killer cells (NK cells) and a rapidly declining clinical course.\\n\\nIt is also called \"aggressive NK-cell lymphoma\".\\n\\nSection::::Signs and symptoms.\\nPatients usually present with constitutional symptoms (malaise, weight loss, fatigue), and hepatosplenomegaly is commonly found on physical exam. Lymphadenopathy is also found to a lesser extent. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, patients may initially present at a more advanced stage, with coagulopathies, hemophagocytic syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Rarely, individuals who have an aggressive NK cell lymphoma that is associated with latent infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (see next section) present with or develop extensive allergic reactions to mosquito bites. The symptoms of these reactions range from a greatly enlarged bite site that may be painful and involve necrosis to systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, swollen lymph nodes, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), or, in extremely rare cases, to life-threatening anaphylaxis. \\n\\nSection::::Cause.\\nThis disease has a strong association with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the true pathogenesis of this disease has yet to be described. The cell of origin is believed to be an NK cell. Blastoid NK cell lymphoma appears to be a different entity and shows no association with EBV.\\n\\nSection::::Sites of involvement.\\nThis disease is typically found and diagnosed in peripheral blood, and while it can involve any organ, it is usually found in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nLeukemic cells are invariably present in samples of peripheral blood to a variable extent. Pancytopenia (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is commonly seen as well.\\n\\nSection::::Peripheral blood.\\nThe leukemic cells have a diameter mildly greater than a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) and have azurophilic granules and nucleoli of varying prominence. Nuclei may be irregular and hyperchromatic.\\n\\nSection::::Bone marrow.\\nBone marrow involvement runs the spectrum between an inconspicuous infiltrate to extensive marrow replacement by leukemic cells. Reactive histiocytes displaying hemophagocytosis can be seen interspersed in the neoplastic infiltrate.\\n\\nSection::::Other organs.\\nLeukemic involvement of organs is typically destructive on tissue sections with necrosis and possibly angioinvasion, and the monotonous infiltrate may be diffuse or patchy.\\n\\nSection::::Immunophenotype.\\nThe immunophenotype of this disease is the same as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and is shown in the table below. CD11b and CD16 show variable expression.\\n\\nSection::::Genetic findings.\\nDue to the NK lineage, clonal rearrangements of lymphoid (T cell receptor; B cell receptor) genes are not seen. The genome of the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is detected in many cases, along with a variety of chromosomal abnormalities.\\n\\nSection::::Treatment.\\nCurrently Aggressive NK-cell leukemia, being a subtype of PTCL, is treated similarly to B-cell lymphomas. However, in recent years, scientists have developed techniques to better recognize the different types of lymphomas, such as PTCL. It is now understood that PTCL behaves differently from B-cell lymphomas and therapies are being developed that specifically target these types of lymphoma. Currently, however, there are no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for PTCL. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens are commonly offered as the initial therapy. Some patients may receive a stem cell transplant. Novel approaches to the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed or refractory setting are under investigation.\\n\\nSection::::Epidemiology.\\nThis rare form of leukemia is more common among Asians in comparison to other ethnic groups. It is typically diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, with a slight predominance in males.\\n\\nSection::::Research directions.\\nPralatrexate is one compound currently under investigations for the treatment of PTCL.\\n', 'title': 'Aggressive NK-cell leukemia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10915749'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'wBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10916548', 'text': 'Volkstaat Council\\n\\nThe Volkstaat Council () was an organisation of 20 people, created by the South African government, to serve as a constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the idea of a Volkstaat to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a Volkstaat.\\n\\nSection::::Members.\\nThe members, all sympathisers of the volkstaat idea, were: Johann Wingaard, a retired industrialist and chairman of the council, Dirk Viljoen, a town planner (vice-chairman), Anna Boshoff, daughter of Hendrik Verwoerd, her son Carel, the nuclear scientist Wally Grant, Chris de Jager, Mars de Klerk and Hercules Booysen, three jurists, Ernest Pienaar, former general in the South African Defence Force, \"Natie\" Luyt, Piet Liebenberg, Chris Jooste and Pikkie Robbertze, four academics, Koos Reyneke, an architect, Douw Steyn, a senior member of the civil defence system, Herman Vercueil from the Transvaalse Landbou-unie, Kobus Visser, a former head of the Criminal Investigation Department, Flip Buys, an executive of the trade union Solidariteit, Duncan du Bois, a local politician in Durban and Riaan Visagie, a teacher.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Volkstaat Council was created by the South African government, via the Volkstaat Council Act in 1994. This was in accordance with sections 184A and 184B of the 1993 South African Constitution, which state: \"The Council shall serve as a constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the idea of a Volkstaat to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a Volkstaat…\".\\n\\nThe council\\'s funding was terminated in 1999, without the council being formally disbanded. The council produced a final report, making three key recommendations:\\n\\nThe provisions in the constitution allowing for formation of the council were removed in 2001, by the Repeal of Volkstaat Council Provisions Act, in accordance with the original act.\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath.\\nJohann Wingard, chair of the council, expressed the view in 2005 that he doubted if any government official ever opened any of the reports to read them. Additionally, he stated that only a \"civil war\" would ever enable Afrikaners to gain independence in any part of South Africa. The opposite is suggested, however, by the fact that then deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, and then Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, quoted figures from Volkstaat Council reports in a report to parliament in 1999. Nelson Mandela, the president at the time, specially requested that the delivery of the report be delayed until he could attend its presentation personally.\\n\\nSubsequent to the disbanding of the Volkstaat Council, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities was established in 2003. This committee is charged with the protection of the rights to cultural identity of all self-identifying groups in South Africa, including Afrikaners. The committee includes an Afrikaner, JCH Landman, who is also a member of the Afrikaner Alliance. The reports from the Volkstaat Council were to be handed over to this committee.\\n\\nThe ANC government formalised their stance on the issue in 1998-1999, when they declared that they would not support a Volkstaat, but would do everything they could to ensure the protection of the Afrikaner language and culture, along with the other minority cultures in the country.\\n', 'title': 'Volkstaat Council', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10916548'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'wRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10918883', 'text': 'Michael Haynes\\n\\nMichael Haynes may refer to:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Michael Haynes', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10918883'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'whhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10920420', 'text': 'Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana\\n\\nThe Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana was all about a bunch of aspiring young hippie entertainers who moved into a youth camp in west Auckland, out of which this community of 60 people produced and directed two musical theatrical productions and toured the North Island of New Zealand in a convoy of Mobile homes, buses and vans, performing at major centres and theatres throughout September and October 1978. While initially four main shows were scheduled for this collective theatre company, repeat and spontaneous performances around the nation saw this number of live performances increased to over 10. This theatrical extravaganza was organised by the Nambassa Trust as part of its national promotion of the arts and towards promoting its 1979 three-day music, crafts and Alternative lifestyle festival, which was held in Waihi and attracted 70,000 people.\\nThe Winter Show production had two parts. The Mahana rock opera, a live rock-theatre production made up of both Māori and Pākehā, combining traditional Māori songs and dances with modern rock music, and depicting early white European colonisation of New Zealand and the impact this had on its local indigenous Māori people. The second part was a high-energy theatre-rock production based on the old theme of cooperation versus competition. The \"Return of the Ancients\" told the story of the battle between \"space angels\" and \"black magicians\" for control of the planet earth. This visual creation was made up of actors, dancers and mime artists performing to a background of rock music, extravagant lighting with weird special effects, fire, bizarre costumes and giant masks.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nThe Nambassa Winter show was coordinated on a voluntary basis by proud young unemployed kiwi hippies against a national backdrop of high unemployment in New Zealand. This era heralded the reformation of many social issues and cultural ideas, with youth (today\\'s baby boomers), encouraging social revolution, while reshaping creativity and artistic direction away from the norm. This period in New Zealand also witnessed many young indigenous Māori activists protesting for land rights and to have past land acquisitions recognised and recompensed. This was the roaring seventies and countercultural idealism was in full swing.\\n\\nThe first 1978 Nambassa festival had been successful and some of the profits from this event were drafted into their Winter Show.\\n\\nTo make this event a reality, the Nambassa core group, who were based in the country villages of Waihi and Waikino at the foot of the ecologically sensitive Coromandel Peninsula, temporarily moved to the city and hired the St John youth camp west of Auckland, from where this production was implemented. Professional and amateur actors, musicians and dancers, choreographers, seamstresses, chiefs, masseurs, prop designers, auto mechanics, various sound and lighting technicians, roadies and administrators (who doubled as actors) assembled at the St Johns camp where, over a period of two months, this production was created and rehearsed. This was a live-in workshop, as most participants in the Winter Show were encouraged to take up temporary residency at the camp; thus the Mother Centre was established. Many participating amateurs later carved out professional careers in the entertainment industry .-\\n\\nSection::::Mahana Rock opera.\\nThe musical production of The Mahana rock opera was a colourful and perceptive view of early New Zealand life and began with the coming of the Māori in canoes from the South West Pacific, their meeting on the high seas and subsequent voyaging to Aotearoa. It portrayed the arrival of the white man, his politics, his religion, early colonisation and the often negative transformation of the country dear to Māoridom. The storyline and music climaxed as Māori and Pākehā do battle with each other, and continued with the eventual reconciliation of the two races. The rock opera employed many special effects, costumes, and some 20 actors, singers and musicians.\\n\\nMahana was formed in 1977 when a group of Māori and Pākehā friends who were mobile-truckers started jamming together. What they shared was a common bond. They were all mobile and lived with their families in a nomadic gypsy lifestyle in handcrafted house trucks and buses. They first came to notoriety when they performed on the Aerial Railway stage at the 1978 Nambassa three-day festival, becoming a huge hit. They called themselves \"Mahana\" in honour of a friend who loaned them his equipment to perform the 1978 festival. Within 24 hours and by popular acclaim they were headlining on the Nambassa main stage with a 20,000W PA in front of tens of thousands of people.\\n\\nAfter the Winter show Mahana performed at the Nambassa 1979 three-day festival in Waihi in front of 40,000 fans and again at the 1981 five-day celebration up Waitawheta valley. At Nambassa 1979 they formed their own self-contained gypsy encampment circle incorporating dozens of house-trucks and buses. This was the beginning of the Road-show Fayre era, and within their large magic circle enclosure, continuous entertainment and theatre was available for children and adults, organised and spontaneous. After the festival the Roadshow Fayre and Mahana continued their musically-founded gypsy lifestyle, touring from town to town entertaining people throughout the nation. Mahana was filmed live on the main stage at Nambassa 1979. The film was part of the New Zealand Film Commissions entry to the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.\\n\\nBy telling the story of New Zealand through a musical blending of the two cultures it was hoped that the Rock Opera would provide a vehicle to express their collective feeling of \"Ko Tahi Tatou\", \"We are one together.\"\\n\\n\"Mahana Rock Opera written by Billy TK and Mahana, and Produced and Directed by John Tucker and Mahana.\"\\n\\nSection::::The Return of the Ancients.\\nThe Return of the Ancients (1978) was a musical theatrical opera which presented a story told in the year 2975 by an old man from another dimension who recounted to the audience a strange and forgotten tale. He spoke of the legend of the lost planet earth, the evolution of humankind and the frail path humans have walked to find their destiny, encountering dark forces reincarnated as humans who sought to destroy culture and civilization. Utilizing best of 1970s visual technology using pulsating light beams, theatre, dance, mime, photo projections, fire, costume and rock music, the production portrays the age-old cosmic battles between the past and the future. The audience witnessed the seeming peace and tranquility at some point in evolution with live music from the legendary Rick Steele, Norma Leaf and Ted Chapman. But civilisation regressed, reflected by fast on-stage theatrics, heavy rock and explosions of special effects. Humans had to suffer captivity at the hands of the black magicians, ogias and demons that followed and obeyed the prince of darkness. Theatrically extravagant cosmic battles were fought live on stage as \"Space Angels\" dressed in multi-coloured rainbow cloaks descended from other planetary systems through two powerful beams of light, to do battle with the negative forces controlling and threatening the existence of planet Earth and its inhabitants.\\n\\n\"The return of the Ancients was written and produced by Peter Terry, Directed by Chris Cooper, Matthew Robinson and Grant Bridger.\"\\n\\nSection::::Principal winter show cast.\\nThe return of the Ancients\\n\"Danze co:\"\\n\\nDancers: Donna Farhi, Stephanie Burns, Caryn Dudson, Matthew Robertson, John Tresize, Bev Wynyard, Brian Tracey, Ellen Currie, Terry Blade and Greg Norman.\\n\\n\"Nambas Theatre troupe:\"\\n\\nFire eating: Mike Colonna and Dave Sheridan.\\n\\nFire dancers: Donna Farhi, Bev Wynyard and Stephanie Burns.\\n\\nPrince of darkness: Brian Tracey.\\n\\nDevil man: Daniel Keighley.\\n\\nOgias or Ogre: Shak MacCready, Fred Alder, Ted Chapman, Peter Terry, Ellen Currie and Brett Fitzpatrick.\\n\\nSpace Angels: John Tresize, Terry Blade, Bev Wynyard, Matthew Robertson and Greg Norman.\\n\\nSun Dancers: Mike Colonna, Dave Sheridan, Mike Taylor and Caryn Dudson.\\n\\n\"Live Music\" by: Rick Steele, Ted Chapman and Norma Leaf.\\n\\nOriginal music score written, arranged and performed by Simon Alexander.\\nProduced and mixed by Simon Alexander and Doug Rogers at Harlequin Studios.\\n\\nMahana Rock Opera\\n\\nLead guitar: John Cossar. 2nd guitar: Aramete.

Andrea developed out of a non-tropical low on May 9 about 150\\xa0miles (240\\xa0km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida, three weeks before the official start of the season. After encountering dry air and strong vertical wind shear, Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression on May 10 while remaining nearly stationary, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11. Andrea's remnant was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm on May 14. Andrea was the first pre-season storm to develop since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981.\\n\\nThe storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20\\xa0feet (6\\xa0m) of beach, leaving 70\\xa0homes in danger of collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34\\xa0feet (10\\xa0m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, but six people drowned as a result of the storm.\\n\\nSection::::Meteorological history.\\nIn early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward through the western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a back-door cold front—a cold front that moves southwestward ahead of a building surface ridge to its north or northeast—southward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area, and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90\\xa0miles (140\\xa0km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and in conjunction with the strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline. The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds. With a lack of tropical moisture, its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered.\\n\\nThe National Hurricane Center first mentioned the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis on May 8, while the storm was located about 230\\xa0miles (370\\xa0km) east-southeast of the South Carolina coastline. Its associated convection had steadily increased as it tracked slowly westward at 5–10\\xa0mph (8–16\\xa0km/h). The system changed little in organization throughout the day, though by the following morning, hurricane specialists indicated the low was acquiring subtropical characteristics as it tracked over progressively warmer waters. Early on May 9, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system revealed winds of 45\\xa0mph (70\\xa0km/h) and a flat thermal core, which indicated the system was neither warm-core nor cold-core. In addition, satellite imagery indicated a consolidation of the convection near the center, as well as hints of upper-level outflow and a contraction of the radius of maximum winds from more than 115\\xa0miles (185\\xa0km) to about 70\\xa0miles (120\\xa0km). Based on the observations and the hybrid structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center classified the low as Subtropical Storm Andrea at 1500\\xa0UTC on May 9 about 150\\xa0miles (240\\xa0km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida. During a subsequent analysis of the storm, researchers estimated that the storm had transitioned into a subtropical cyclone nine hours earlier. As Andrea developed before June 1—the traditional start of hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean—it became the first pre-season storm since Tropical Storm Ana in April\\xa02003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in\\xa01981.\\nUpon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was embedded within a large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures of no more than 77\\xa0°\\xa0F (25\\xa0°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500\\xa0UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18\\xa0hours about 80\\xa0miles (125\\xa0km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.\\n\\nLater on May 11, convection re-fired over the center as the system drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone. By May 12, shower activity had organized greatly to the east of the center, and the National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression. It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.\\n\\nSection::::Preparations.\\nDue to rough surf from the precursor low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory for much of the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from the mouth of the Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued for much of the South Carolina coastline.\\n\\nAt Isle of Palms in South Carolina, workers and dozens of firefighters prepared sandbags in preparation for high tide after waves from the storm previously caused moderate beach erosion. As a precaution, officials there intentionally cut power and gas to multiple uninhabited buildings. Officials closed schools in Dare County, North Carolina due to the threat for high winds from the storm. The North Carolina Department of Transportation also canceled ferry transportation to and from Ocracoke and Knotts Island, North Carolina.\\n\\nSection::::Impact.\\nPrior to becoming a subtropical cyclone, the low produced gale-force winds and dangerous surf near the coast from North Carolina through Georgia, and later along the coast of Florida. Significant swells were also reported in the Bahamas. The waves caused beach erosion and washed up against coastal houses along the southeast coast of the United States.\\n\\nSection::::Southeastern U.S..\\nOff the coast of North Carolina, the storm produced 34-foot (10-m) waves and storm force winds which damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard. All nine were injured to some degree; three endured hypothermia, one received a broken rib, and one Coast Guardsman experienced back injuries from the surf. Another boat and its four occupants were reported missing, and after twelve days they remain missing. Rough waves from the precursor low left two kayakers missing near Seabrook Island, South Carolina. One was found the next day, and the other was found dead a week later.\\n\\nOnshore, winds reached 52\\xa0mph (84\\xa0km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia, with an unofficial report of 57\\xa0mph (92\\xa0km/h) near Virginia Beach. Similar observations occurred along the Outer Banks, with the winds knocking some tree limbs onto power lines; some isolated power outages were reported. Wind damage included some roofs losing shingles from the winds. In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, an outer rainband dropped 0.5\\xa0inches (10\\xa0mm) of precipitation in about two\\xa0hours as well as several lightning strikes; one bolt of lightning injured two firefighters. The winds covered portions of North Carolina Highway 12 with sand, and for a day the route was closed after waves from the storm washed out about 200\\xa0feet (60\\xa0m) of roadway. In some locations, the waves eroded up to 20\\xa0feet (6\\xa0m) of beach, leaving 70\\xa0homes in imminent danger. On St. Simons Island in Georgia, the storm produced a storm tide of 8.09\\xa0feet (2.43\\xa0m). Trace amounts of rainfall occurred in the southeastern portion of the state.\\n\\nSection::::Florida.\\nIn Florida, waves of over 10\\xa0feet (3\\xa0m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two occupants were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat that had previously been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77\\xa0inches (20\\xa0mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Subtropical Storm Andrea', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10923896'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10924948', 'text': 'Karlapalem\\n\\nKarlapalem is a village in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

It exists as two geometric isomers, \"E\" (\"trans\") and \"Z\" (\"cis\"). The term diazene is more common for organic derivatives of diimide. Thus, azobenzene is an example of an organic diazene.\\n\\nSection::::Synthesis.\\nThe traditional route to diimide involves oxidation of hydrazine with hydrogen peroxide or air. Alternatively the decarboxylation of azodicarboxylic acid affords diimide:\\nDiimide can also be efficiently generated by elimination of sulfonohydrazides using a suitable base. For example, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonohydrazide eliminates diimide upon treatment with sodium bicarbonate.\\n\\nBecause of its instability, diimide is generated and used \"in-situ\". A mixture of both the \"cis\" (\"Z-\") and \"trans\" (\"E-\") isomers is produced. Both isomers are unstable, and they undergo a slow interconversion. The \"trans\" isomer is more stable, but the \"cis\" isomer is the one that reacts with unsaturated substrates, therefore the equilibrium between them shifts towards the \"cis\" isomer due to Le Chatelier\\'s principle. Some procedures call for the addition of carboxylic acids, which catalyse the cis–trans isomerization. Diimide decomposes readily. Even at low temperatures, the more stable \"trans\" isomer rapidly undergoes various disproportionation reactions, primarily forming hydrazine and nitrogen gas:\\nBecause of this competing decomposition reaction, reductions with diimide typically require a large excess of the precursor reagent.\\n\\nSection::::Applications to organic synthesis.\\nDiimide is occasionally useful as a reagent in organic synthesis. It hydrogenates alkenes and alkynes with selective delivery of hydrogen from one face of the substrate resulting in the same stereoselectivty as metal-catalysed \"syn\" addition of H. The only coproduct released is nitrogen gas. Although the method is cumbersome, the use of diimide avoids the need for high pressures or hydrogen gas and metal catalysts, which can be expensive. The hydrogenation mechanism involves a six-membered CHN transition state:\\n\\nSection::::Selectivity.\\nDiimide is advantageous because it selectively reduces alkenes and alkynes and is unreactive toward many functional groups that would interfere with normal catalytic hydrogenation. Thus, peroxides, alkyl halides, and thiols are tolerated by diimide, but these same groups would typically be degraded by metal catalysts. The reagent preferentially reduces alkynes and unhindered or strained alkenes to the corresponding alkenes and alkanes.\\n\\nSection::::Related.\\nThe dicationic form, HNNH (diprotonated dinitrogen), is calculated to have the strongest known chemical bond.

A leap day is added in various solar calendars (calendars based on the Earth\\'s revolution around the Sun), including the Gregorian calendar standard in most of the world. Lunisolar calendars (whose months are based on the phases of the Moon) instead add a leap or intercalary month.\\n\\nIn the Gregorian calendar, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100, 2200, and 2300. Conversely, 1600 and 2000 did and 2400 will. Years containing a leap day are called leap years. Years not containing a leap day are called common years. February 29 is the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar, in such a year, with 306 days remaining until the end of the year. In the Chinese calendar, this day will only occur in years of the monkey, dragon, and rat.\\n\\nA leap day is observed because the Earth\\'s period of orbital revolution around the Sun takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 whole days. A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the Earth\\'s position in the Solar System; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11, and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the \"century rule\" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox.\\n\\nSection::::Leap years.\\nAlthough most modern calendar years have 365 days, a complete revolution around the Sun (one solar year) takes approximately 365 days and 6 hours. An extra 24 hours thus accumulates every four years, requiring that an extra calendar day be added to align the calendar with the Sun\\'s apparent position. Without the added day, in future years the seasons would occur later in the calendar, eventually leading to confusion about when to undertake activities dependent on weather, ecology, or hours of daylight.\\n\\nA solar year is actually slightly shorter than 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 days), which had been known since the 2nd century BC when Hipparchus stated that it lasted 365 + − days, but this was ignored by Julius Caesar and his astronomical adviser Sosigenes. The Gregorian calendar corrected this by adopting the length of the tropical year stated in three medieval sources, the Alfonsine tables, De Revolutionibus, and the Prutenic Tables, truncated to two sexagesimal places, 365 days or 365 + − days or 365.2425 days. The length of the tropical year in 2000 was 365.24217 mean solar days, Adding a calendar day every four years, therefore, results in an excess of around 44 minutes every four years, or about 3 days every 400 years. To compensate for this, three days are removed every 400 years. The Gregorian calendar reform implements this adjustment by making an exception to the general rule that there is a leap year every four years. Instead, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless that year is also divisible by 400. This means that the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.\\n\\nSection::::Modern (Gregorian) calendar.\\nThe Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, which is exactly 20,871 weeks including 97 leap days (146,097 days). Over this period, February 29 falls on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday 13 times each; 14 times each on Friday and Saturday; and 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday. Excepting when a century mark that is not a multiple of 400 intervenes, consecutive leaps days fall in order Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and Saturday; then repeating with Thursday again.\\n\\nSection::::Early Roman calendar.\\nThe calendar of the Roman king Numa Pompilius had only 355 days (even though it was not a lunar calendar) which meant that it would quickly become unsynchronized with the solar year. An earlier Roman solution to this problem was to lengthen the calendar periodically by adding extra days to February, the last month of the year. February consisted of two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the \"Terminalia\" on the 23rd, which was considered the end of the religious year, and the five remaining days formed the second part. To keep the calendar year roughly aligned with the solar year, a leap month, called \"Mensis Intercalaris\" (\"intercalary month\"), was added from time to time between these two parts of February. The (usual) second part of February was incorporated in the intercalary month as its last five days, with no change either in their dates or the festivals observed on them. This followed naturally, because the days after the Ides (13th) of February (in an ordinary year) or the Ides of Intercalaris (in an intercalary year) both counted down to the Kalends of March (i.e. they were known as \"the \"n\"th day before the Kalends of March\"). The Nones (5th) and Ides of Intercalaris occupied their normal positions.\\n\\nThe third-century writer Censorinus says:\\n\\nSection::::Julian reform.\\nThe set leap day was introduced in Rome as a part of the Julian reform in the 1st century BC. As before, the intercalation was made after February 23. The day following the Terminalia (February 23) was doubled, forming the \"\"bis sextum\"\"—literally \\'twice sixth\\', since February 24 was \\'the sixth day before the Kalends of March\\' using Roman inclusive counting (March 1 was the Kalends of March and was also the first day of the calendar year). Inclusive counting initially caused the Roman priests to add the extra day every three years instead of four; Augustus was compelled to omit leap years for a few decades to return the calendar to its proper position. Although there were exceptions, the first day of the \"bis sextum\" (February 24) was usually regarded as the intercalated or \"bissextile\" day since the 3rd century AD. February 29 came to be regarded as the leap day when the Roman system of numbering days was replaced by sequential numbering in the late Middle Ages, although this has only been formally enacted in Sweden and Finland. In Britain, the extra day added to leap years remains notionally the 24th, although the 29th remains more visible on the calendar.\\n\\nSection::::Born on February 29.\\nA person born on February 29 may be called a \"leapling\", a \"leaper\", or a \"leap-year baby\". In non-leap years, some leaplings celebrate their birthday on either February 28 or March 1, while others only observe birthdays on the authentic intercalary date, February 29.\\n\\nSection::::Legal status.\\nThe effective legal date of a leapling\\'s birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom and its former colony Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 turns 18, they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year.\\nIn New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years, for the purposes of Driver Licensing under §2(2) of the Land Transport (Driver Licensing) Rule 1999. The net result is that for drivers aged 75, or over 80, their driver licence expires at the end of the last day of February, even though their birthday would otherwise fall on the first day in March in non-leap years. Otherwise, New Zealand legislation is silent on when a person born on 29 February has their birthday, although case law would suggest that age is computed based on the number of years elapsed, from the day after the date of birth, and that the person\\'s birth day then occurs on the last day of the year period. This differs from English common law where a birthday is considered to be the start of the next year, the preceding year ending at midnight on the day preceding the birthday. While a person attains the same age on the same day, it also means that, in New Zealand, if something must be done by the time a person attains a certain age, that thing can be done on the birthday that they attain that age and still be lawful.\\n\\nIn Taiwan, the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:\\n\\nThus, in England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If they were born in Taiwan they legally become 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, according to John Reitz, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, there is no \"... statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day.\" Reitz speculates that \"March 1 would likely be considered the legal birthday in non-leap years of someone born on leap day,\" using the same reasoning as described for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.\\n\\nSection::::In fiction.\\nThere are many instances in children\\'s literature where a person\\'s claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting only their leap-year birthdays.\\n\\nA similar device is used in the plot of Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s 1879 comic opera \"The Pirates of Penzance\": as a child, Frederic was apprenticed to a band of pirates until his 21st birthday. Having passed his 21st year, he leaves the pirate band and falls in love. However, since he was born on February 29, his 21st \"birthday\" will not arrive until he is eighty-eight (since 1900 was not a leap year), so he must leave his fiancée and return to the pirates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Folk traditions.\\nThere is a popular tradition known as Bachelor\\'s Day in some countries allowing a woman to propose marriage to a man on February 29. If the man refuses, he then is obliged to give the woman money or buy her a dress. In upper-class societies in Europe, if the man refuses marriage, he then must purchase 12 pairs of gloves for the woman, suggesting that the gloves are to hide the woman\\'s embarrassment of not having an engagement ring. In Ireland, the tradition is supposed to originate from a deal that Saint Bridget struck with Saint Patrick.\\n\\nIn the town of Aurora, Illinois, single women are deputized and may arrest single men, subject to a four-dollar fine, every February 29.\\n\\nIn Greece, it is considered unlucky to marry on a leap day.\\n\\n', 'title': 'February 29', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10936', 'cat_id': '10936', 'cat_title': '1747_books', 'cat_pages': '4', 'cat_subcats': '1', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '0RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10936170', 'text': 'Star Trek: The Next Generation: A World For All Seasons\\n\\nStar Trek: The Next Generation – A World for All Seasons was a \"Star Trek\" adventure game under development by Spectrum HoloByte for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer game console.

The formation of these forces posed economic challenges after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, and required reforms to professionalize the Ground Forces during the transition.\\n\\nSince 1992, the Ground Forces have withdrawn thousands of troops from former Soviet garrisons abroad, while remaining extensively committed to the Chechen Wars, peacekeeping, and other operations in the Soviet successor states (what is known in Russia as the \"near abroad\").\\n\\nSection::::Mission.\\nThe primary responsibilities of the Ground Forces are the protection of the state borders, combat on land, the security of occupied territories, and the defeat of enemy troops. The Ground Forces must be able to achieve these goals both in nuclear war and non-nuclear war, especially without the use of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, they must be capable of protecting the national interests of Russia within the framework of its international obligations.\\n\\nThe Main Command of the Ground Forces is officially tasked with the following objectives:\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nAs the Soviet Union dissolved, efforts were made to keep the Soviet Armed Forces as a single military structure for the new Commonwealth of Independent States. The last Minister of Defence of the Soviet Union, Marshal Yevgeny Shaposhnikov, was appointed supreme commander of the CIS Armed Forces in December 1991.\\nAmong the numerous treaties signed by the former republics, in order to direct the transition period, was a temporary agreement on general purpose forces, signed in Minsk on 14 February 1992. However, once it became clear that Ukraine (and potentially the other republics) was determined to undermine the concept of joint general purpose forces and form their own armed forces, the new Russian government moved to form its own armed forces.\\n\\nRussian president Boris Yeltsin signed a decree forming the Russian Ministry of Defence on 7 May 1992, establishing the Russian Ground Forces along with the other branches of the military. At the same time, the General Staff was in the process of withdrawing tens of thousands of personnel from the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, the Northern Group of Forces in Poland, the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia, the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary, and from Mongolia.\\n\\nThirty-seven divisions had to be withdrawn from the four groups of forces and the Baltic States, and four military districts—totalling 57 divisions—were handed over to Belarus and Ukraine.\\nSome idea of the scale of the withdrawal can be gained from the division list. For the dissolving Soviet Ground Forces, the withdrawal from the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic states was an extremely demanding, expensive, and debilitating process.\\nAs the military districts that remained in Russia after the collapse of the Union consisted mostly of the mobile cadre formations, the Ground Forces were, to a large extent, created by relocating the formerly full-strength formations from Eastern Europe to under-resourced districts. However, the facilities in those districts were inadequate to house the flood of personnel and equipment returning from abroad, and many units \"were unloaded from the rail wagons into empty fields.\"\\nThe need for destruction and transfer of large amounts of weaponry under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe also necessitated great adjustments.\\n\\nSection::::Post-Soviet reform plans.\\nThe Ministry of Defence newspaper \"Krasnaya Zvezda\" published a reform plan on 21 July 1992. Later one commentator said it was \"hastily\" put together by the General Staff \"to satisfy the public demand for radical changes.\"\\nThe General Staff, from that point, became a bastion of conservatism, causing a build-up of troubles that later became critical. The reform plan advocated a change from an Army-Division-Regiment structure to a Corps-Brigade arrangement. The new structures were to be more capable in a situation with no front line, and more capable of independent action at all levels. Cutting out a level of command, omitting two out of three higher echelons between the theatre headquarters and the fighting battalions, would produce economies, increase flexibility, and simplify command-and-control arrangements.\\nThe expected changeover to the new structure proved to be rare, irregular, and sometimes reversed. The new brigades that appeared were mostly divisions that had broken down until they happened to be at the proposed brigade strengths. New divisions—such as the new 3rd Motor Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, formed on the basis of disbanding tank formations—were formed, rather than new brigades.\\n\\nFew of the reforms planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm civilian political guidance, with President Yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.\\nSecondly, declining funding worsened the progress. Finally, there was no firm consensus within the military about what reforms should be implemented. General Pavel Grachev, the first Russian Minister of Defence (1992–96), broadly advertised reforms, yet wished to preserve the old Soviet-style Army, with large numbers of low-strength formations and continued mass conscription. The General Staff and the armed services tried to preserve Soviet era doctrines, deployments, weapons, and missions in the absence of solid new guidance.\\n\\nA British military expert, Michael Orr, claims that the hierarchy had great difficulty in fully understanding the changed situation, due to their education. As graduates of Soviet military academies, they received great operational and staff training, but in political terms they had learned an ideology, rather than a wide understanding of international affairs. Thus, the generals—focused on NATO expanding to the east—could not adapt themselves and the Armed Forces to the new opportunities and challenges they faced.\\n\\nSection::::Internal crisis of 1993.\\nThe Ground Forces reluctantly became involved in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 after President Yeltsin issued an unconstitutional decree dissolving the Parliament, following the Parliament\\'s resistance to Yeltsin\\'s consolidation of power and his neo-liberal reforms. A group of deputies, including Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, barricaded themselves inside the Parliament building. While giving public support to the President, the Armed Forces, led by General Grachev, tried to remain neutral, following the wishes of the officer corps.\\nThe military leadership were unsure of both the rightness of Yeltsin\\'s cause and the reliability of their forces, and had to be convinced at length by Yeltsin to attack the Parliament.\\n\\nWhen the attack was finally mounted, forces from five different divisions around Moscow were used, and the personnel involved were mostly officers and senior non-commissioned officers. There were also indications that some formations deployed into Moscow only under protest. However, once Parliament had been stormed, the parliamentary leaders arrested, and temporary censorship imposed, Yeltsin succeeded in retaining power.\\n\\nSection::::Chechen Wars.\\nSection::::First Chechen War.\\nThe Chechen people had never willingly accepted Russian rule. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Chechens declared independence in November 1991, under the leadership of a former Air Forces officer, General Dzhokar Dudayev.\\nThe continuation of Chechen independence was seen as reducing Moscow\\'s authority; Chechnya became perceived as a haven for criminals, and a hard-line group within the Kremlin began advocating war. A Security Council meeting was held 29 November 1994, where Yeltsin ordered the Chechens to disarm, or else Moscow would restore order. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev assured Yeltsin that he would \"take Grozny with one airborne assault regiment in two hours.\"\\n\\nThe operation began on 11 December 1994 and, by 31 December, Russian forces were entering Grozny, the Chechen capital. The 131st Motor Rifle Brigade was ordered to make a swift push for the centre of the city, but was then virtually destroyed in Chechen ambushes. After finally seizing Grozny amid fierce resistance, Russian troops moved on to other Chechen strongholds. When Chechen militants took hostages in the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in Stavropol Kray in June 1995, peace looked possible for a time, but the fighting continued. Following this incident, the separatists were referred to as \"insurgents\" or \"terrorists\" within Russia.\\n\\nDzhokar Dudayev was assassinated in April 1996, and that summer, a Chechen attack retook Grozny. Alexander Lebed, then Secretary of the Security Council, began talks with the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov in August 1996 and signed an agreement on 22/23 August; by the end of that month, the fighting ended.\\nThe formal ceasefire was signed in the Dagestani town of Khasavyurt on 31 August 1996, stipulating that a formal agreement on relations between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the Russian federal government need not be signed until late 2001.\\n\\nWriting some years later, Dmitri Trenin and Aleksei Malashenko described the Russian military\\'s performance in Chechniya as \"grossly deficient at all levels, from commander-in-chief to the drafted private.\"\\nThe Ground Forces\\' performance in the First Chechen War has been assessed by a British academic as \"appallingly bad\".\\nWriting six years later, Michael Orr said \"one of the root causes of the Russian failure in 1994–96 was their inability to raise and deploy a properly trained military force.\"\\n\\nSection::::Second Chechen War.\\nThe Second Chechen War began in August 1999 after Chechen militias invaded neighboring Dagestan, followed quickly in early September by a series of four terrorist bombings across Russia. This prompted Russian military action against the alleged Chechen culprits.\\n\\nIn the first Chechen war, the Russians primarily laid waste to an area with artillery and airstrikes before advancing the land forces. Improvements were made in the Ground Forces between 1996 and 1999; when the Second Chechen War started, instead of hastily assembled \"composite regiments\" dispatched with little or no training, whose members had never seen service together, formations were brought up to strength with replacements, put through preparatory training, and then dispatched. Combat performance improved accordingly, and large-scale opposition was crippled.\\n\\nMost of the prominent past Chechen separatist leaders had died or been killed, including former president Aslan Maskhadov and leading warlord and terrorist attack mastermind Shamil Basayev. However, small-scale conflict continued to drag on; as of November 2007, it had spread across other parts of the Russian Caucasus.\\nIt was a divisive struggle, with at least one senior military officer dismissed for being unresponsive to government commands: General Colonel Gennady Troshev was dismissed in 2002 for refusing to move from command of the North Caucasus Military District to command of the less important Siberian Military District.\\n\\nThe Second Chechen War was officially declared ended on 16 April 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Reforms under Sergeyev.\\nWhen Igor Sergeyev arrived as Minister of Defence in 1997, he initiated what were seen as real reforms under very difficult conditions.\\nThe number of military educational establishments, virtually unchanged since 1991, was reduced, and the amalgamation of the Siberian and Trans-Baikal Military Districts was ordered. A larger number of army divisions were given \"constant readiness\" status, which was supposed to bring them up to 80 percent manning and 100 percent equipment holdings. Sergeyev announced in August 1998 that there would be six divisions and four brigades on 24-hour alert by the end of that year. Three levels of forces were announced; constant readiness, low-level, and strategic reserves.\\n\\nHowever, personnel quality—even in these favored units—continued to be a problem. Lack of fuel for training and a shortage of well-trained junior officers hampered combat effectiveness. However, concentrating on the interests of his old service, the Strategic Rocket Forces, Sergeyev directed the disbanding of the Ground Forces headquarters itself in December 1997. The disbandment was a \"military nonsense\", in Orr\\'s words, \"justifiable only in terms of internal politics within the Ministry of Defence\". The Ground Forces\\' prestige declined as a result, as the headquarters disbandment implied—at least in theory—that the Ground Forces no longer ranked equally with the Air Force and Navy.\\n\\nSection::::Reforms under Putin.\\nUnder President Vladimir Putin, more funds were committed, the Ground Forces Headquarters was reestablished, and some progress on professionalisation occurred. Plans called for reducing mandatory service to 18 months in 2007, and to one year by 2008, but a mixed Ground Force, of both contract soldiers and conscripts, would remain. (As of 2009, the length of conscript service was 12 months.)\\n\\nFunding increases began in 1999; after some recovery in the Russian economy and the associated rise in income, especially from oil, \"Russia\\'s officially reported defence spending [rose] in nominal terms at least, for the first time since the formation of the Russian Federation\".\\nThe budget rose from 141 billion rubles in 2000 to 219 billion rubles in 2001.\\nMuch of this funding has been spent on personnel—there have been several pay rises, starting with a 20-percent rise authorised in 2001; the current professionalisation programme, including 26,000 extra sergeants, was expected to cost at least 31 billion roubles ($1.1 billion USD).\\nIncreased funding has been spread across the whole budget, with personnel spending being matched by greater procurement and research and development funding.\\n\\nHowever, in 2004, Alexander Goltz said that, given the insistence of the hierarchy on trying to force contract soldiers into the old conscript pattern, there is little hope of a fundamental strengthening of the Ground Forces. He further elaborated that they are expected to remain, to some extent, a military liability and \"Russia\\'s most urgent social problem\" for some time to come.\\nGoltz summed up by saying: \"All of this means that the Russian armed forces are not ready to defend the country and that, at the same time, they are also dangerous for Russia. Top military personnel demonstrate neither the will nor the ability to effect fundamental changes.\"\\n\\nMore money is arriving both for personnel and equipment; Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in June 2008 that monetary allowances for servicemen in permanent-readiness units will be raised significantly.\\nIn May 2007, it was announced that enlisted pay would rise to 65,000 roubles (US$2,750) per month, and the pay of officers on combat duty in rapid response units would rise to 100,000–150,000 roubles (US$4,230–$6,355) per month. However, while the move to one year conscript service would disrupt \"dedovshchina\", it is unlikely that bullying will disappear altogether without significant societal change.\\nOther assessments from the same source point out that the Russian Armed Forces faced major disruption in 2008, as demographic change hindered plans to reduce the term of conscription from two years to one.\\n\\nSection::::Serdyukov reforms.\\nA major reorganisation of the force began in 2007 by the Minister for Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov, with the aim of converting all divisions into brigades, and cutting surplus officers and establishments.\\nHowever, this affected units of continuous readiness () only. It is intended to create 39 to 40 such brigades by 1 January 2016, including 39 all-arms brigades, 21 artillery and MRL brigades, seven brigades of army air defence forces, 12 communication brigades, and two electronic warfare brigades. In addition, the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division stationed in the Far East remained, and there will be an additional 17 separate regiments. The reform has been called \"unprecedented\".\\n\\nIn the course of the reorganization, the 4-chain command structure (military district - field army - division - regiment) that was used until then was replaced with a 3-chain structure: strategic command - operational command - brigade. Brigades are supposed to be used as mobile permanent-readiness units capable of fighting independently with the support of highly mobile task forces or together with other brigades under joint command.\\n\\nIn a statement on 4 September 2009, RGF Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Boldyrev said that half of the Russian land forces were reformed by 1 June and that 85 brigades of constant combat preparedness had already been created. Among them are the combined-arms brigade, missile brigades, assault brigades and electronic warfare brigades.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nThe President of Russia is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The Main Command (\"Glavkomat\") of the Ground Forces, based in Moscow, directs activities. This body was disbanded in 1997, but reformed by President Putin in 2001 by appointing Colonel General Nikolai Kormiltsev as the commander-in-chief of the ground forces and also as a deputy minister of defense. Kormiltsev handed over command to Colonel General (later General of the Army) Alexey Maslov in 2004, and in a realignment of responsibilities, the Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief lost his position as a deputy minister of defence. Like Kormiltsev, while serving as Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief Maslov has been promoted to General of the Army.\\n\\nIn January 2014, the acting commander of the Russian Ground Forces is Lieutenant General Sergei Istrakov, who was appointed by Russian president Vladimir Putin upon the dismissal of former commander Colonel General Vladimir Chirkin over corruption charges in December 2013. Istrakov handed over to a new commander on 2 May 2014, Colonel general Oleg Salyukov.\\n\\nThe Main Command of the Ground Forces consists of the Main Staff of the Ground Troops, and departments for Peacekeeping Forces, Armaments of the Ground Troops, Rear Services of the Ground Troops, Cadres of the Ground Troops (personnel), Indoctrination Work, and Military Education. There were also a number of directorates which used to be commanded by the Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief in his capacity as a deputy defence minister. They included NBC Protection Troops of the Armed Forces, Engineer Troops of the Armed Forces, and Troop Air Defence, as well as several others. Their exact command status is now unknown.\\n\\nSection::::Branches of service.\\nThe branches of service include motorized rifles, tanks, artillery and rocket forces, troop air defense, special corps (reconnaissance, signals, radioelectronic warfare, engineering, nuclear, biological and chemical protection, logistical support, automobile, and the protection of the rear), military units, and logistical establishments.\\n\\nThe Motorised Rifle Troops, the most numerous branch of service, constitutes the nucleus of Ground Forces\\' battle formations. They are equipped with powerful armament for destruction of ground-based and aerial targets, missile complexes, tanks, artillery and mortars, anti-tank guided missiles, anti-aircraft missile systems and installations, and means of reconnaissance and control. It is estimated that there are currently 19 motor rifle divisions, and the Navy now has several motor rifle formations under its command in the Ground and Coastal Defence Forces of the Baltic Fleet, the Northeastern Group of Troops and Forces on the Kamchatka Peninsula and other areas of the extreme northeast. Also present are a large number of mobilisation divisions and brigades, known as \"Bases for Storage of Weapons and Equipment\", that in peacetime only have enough personnel assigned to guard the site and maintain the weapons.\\n\\nThe Tank Troops are the main impact force of the Ground Forces and a powerful means of armed struggle, intended for the accomplishment of the most important combat tasks. As of 2007, there were three tank divisions in the force: the 4th and 10th within the Moscow Military District, and 5th Guards \"Don\" in the Siberian MD.\\nThe 2nd Guards Tank Division in the Siberian Military District and the 21st Tank Division in the Far Eastern MD were disbanded.\\n\\nThe Artillery and Rocket Forces provide the Ground Forces\\' main firepower. The Ground Forces currently include five or six static defence machine-gun/artillery divisions and seemingly now one division of field artillery—the 34th Guards in the Moscow MD. The previous 12th in the Siberian MD, and the 15th in the Far Eastern MD, seem to have disbanded.\\n\\nThe Air Defense Troops (PVO) are one of the basic weapons for the destruction of enemy air forces. They consist of surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery and radio-technical units and subdivisions.\\n\\nArmy Aviation, while intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces, has been under the control of the Air Forces (VVS) since 2003. However, by 2015, Army Aviation will have been transferred back to the Ground Forces and 18 new aviation brigades will have been added. Of the around 1,000 new helicopters that have been ordered under the State Armament Programmes, 900 will be for the Army Aviation.\\n\\nSection::::Dispositions since 2010.\\nAs a result of the 2008 Russian military reforms, the ground forces now consist of armies subordinate to the four new military districts: (Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Military Districts). The new districts have the role of \\'operational strategic commands,\\' which command the Ground Forces as well as the Naval Forces and part of the Air and Air Defence Forces within their areas of responsibility.\\n\\nEach major formation is bolded, and directs the non-bolded major subordinate formations.\\nIt is not entirely clear to which superior(s) the four operational-strategic commands will report from 1 December 2010, as they command formations from multiple services (Air Force, Ground Forces & Navy). A current detailed list of the subordinate units of the four military districts can be found in the respective articles. During 2009, all 23 remaining divisions were reorganised into four tank brigades, 35 motor-rifle brigades, one \"prikritiya\" brigade formed from a machinegun-light artillery division, and three airborne-assault brigades (pre-existing). Almost all are now designated \"otdelnaya\" (separate), with only several brigades retaining the guards honorific title.\\n\\nIn 2013, two of these brigades were reactivated as full divisions: the 2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division and 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division. These two divisions marked the beginning of the expansion of the Ground Forces as more brigades are being reformed into full divisions within each military district.\\n\\nSection::::Personnel.\\nIn 2006, the Ground Forces included an estimated total of 395,000 persons, including approximately 190,000 conscripts and 35,000 personnel of the Airborne Forces (VDV).\\nThis can be compared to an estimated 670,000, with 210,000 conscripts, in 1995–96. These numbers should be treated with caution, however, due to the difficulty for those outside Russia to make accurate assessments, and confusion even within the General Staff on the numbers of conscripts within the force.\\n\\nThe Ground Forces began their existence in 1992, inheriting the Soviet military manpower system practically unchanged, though it was in a state of rapid decay. The Soviet Ground Forces were traditionally manned through terms of conscription, which had been reduced in 1967 from three to two years. This system was administered through the thousands of military commissariats ( [\"voyenkomat\"]) located throughout the Soviet Union. Between January and May of each year, every young Soviet male citizen was required to report to the local \"voyenkomat\" for assessment for military service, following a summons based on lists from every school and employer in the area.\\n\\nThe \"voyenkomat\" worked to quotas sent out by a department of the General Staff, listing how many young men were required by each service and branch of the Armed Forces.\\n(Since the fall of the Soviet Union, draft evasion has skyrocketed; officials regularly bemoan the ten or so percent that actually appear when summoned.) The new conscripts were then picked up by an officer from their future unit and usually sent by train across the country. On arrival, they would begin the Young Soldiers\\' course, and become part of the system of senior rule, known as \"dedovshchina\", literally \"rule by the grandfathers.\" There were only a very small number of professional non-commissioned officers (NCOs), as most NCOs were conscripts sent on short courses\\nto prepare them for section commanders\\' and platoon sergeants\\' positions. These conscript NCOs were supplemented by \"praporshchik\" warrant officers, positions created in the 1960s to support the increased variety of skills required for modern weapons.\\n\\nThe Soviet Army\\'s officer-to-soldier ratio was extremely top-heavy, partially in order to compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following World\\xa0War\\xa0II and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having to accept responsibility for the soldiers\\' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, many junior officers did not wish to serve—in 2002, more than half the officers who left the forces did so early. Their morale was low, among other reasons because their postings were entirely in the hands of their immediate superiors and the personnel department. \"Without having to account for their actions, they can choose to promote or not promote him, to send him to Moscow or to some godforsaken post on the Chinese border.\"\\n\\nThere is little available information on the current status of women, who are not conscripted, in the Ground Forces. According to the BBC, there were 90,000 women in the Russian Army in 2002, though estimates on numbers of women across the entire Russian armed forces in 2000 ranged from 115,000 to 160,000.\\nWomen serve in support roles, most commonly in the fields of nursing, communications, and engineering. Some officers\\' wives have become contract service personnel.\\n\\nSection::::Contract soldiers.\\nFrom small beginnings in the early 1990s, employment of contract soldiers (\"kontraktniki\") has grown greatly within the Ground Forces, though many have been of poor quality (wives of officers with no other prospective employment, for example). In December 2005, Sergei Ivanov, then Minister of Defence, proposed that—in addition to the numerous enlisted contract soldiers—all sergeants should become professional, which would raise the number of professional soldiers and non-commissioned officers in the Armed Forces overall to approximately 140,000 in 2008. The current programme allows for an extra 26,000 posts for fully professional sergeants.\\n\\nThe CIA reported in the \"World Factbook\" that 30 percent of Russian army personnel were contract servicemen at the end of 2005, and that, as of May 2006, 178,000 contract servicemen were serving in the Ground Forces and the Navy. Planning calls for volunteer servicemen to compose 70 percent of armed forces by 2010, with the remaining servicemen consisting of conscripts. At the end of 2005, the Ground Forces had 40 all-volunteer constant readiness units, with another 20 constant readiness units to be formed in 2006. These CIA figures can be set against IISS data, which reports that at the end of 2004, the number of contracts being signed in the Moscow Military District was only 17 percent of the target figure; in the North Caucasus, 45 percent; and in the Volga-Ural, 25 percent.\\n\\nWhatever the number of contract soldiers, commentators such as Alexander Goltz are pessimistic that many more combat ready units will result, as senior officers \"see no difference between professional NCOs, ...\\xa0versus conscripts who have been drilled in training schools for less than six months. Such sergeants will have neither the knowledge nor the experience that can help them win authority [in] the barracks.\" Defence Minister Sergey Ivanov underlined the in-barracks discipline situation, even after years of attempted professionalisation, when releasing the official injury figures for 2002. 531 men had died on duty as a result of accidents and crimes, and 20,000 had been wounded (the numbers apparently not including suicides). According to Ivanov, \"the accident rate is not falling\". Two of every seven conscripts will become addicted to drugs and alcohol while serving their terms, and a further one in twenty will suffer homosexual rape, according to 2005 reports.\\n\\nPart of the reason is the feeling between contract servicemen, conscripts, and officers. \\n\\nSection::::Equipment.\\nThe Ground Forces retain a very large quantity of vehicles and equipment. There is also likely to be a great deal of older equipment in state military storage, a practice continued from the Soviet Union. However, following the collapse of the USSR, the newly independent republics became host to most of the formations with modern equipment, whereas Russia was left with lower-category units, usually with older equipment. As financial stringency began to bite harder, the amount of new equipment fell as well, and by 1998, only ten tanks and about 30 BMP infantry fighting vehicles were being purchased each year.\\n\\nNew equipment, like the Armata Universal Combat Platform, Bumerang and Kurganets-25 will be equipped from 2015 and replace many old tanks, BMPs, BTRs like T-72, T-90, BMP-1/2/3, BTR-80 in active service.\\nFunding for new equipment has greatly risen in recent years, and the Russian defence industry continues to develop new weapons systems for the Ground Forces.\\nLevel of modern weapons in the Ground Forces is 42 per cent in late 2016. Two Iskander-M missile system brigade sets, over 60 Tornado-G MLRS and more than 20 Msta-SM self-propelled howitzers have been received in 2016. More than 70 upgraded Grad-M MLRS have been fielded too. Russian Land Forces received two brigade sets of Buk-M3 and Buk-M2 air defence missile complexes in 2016. Troops also received two division sets of Tor-M2 and two of Tor-M2U air defence missile complexes. Moreover, the Forces received Verba MANPADS, more than 130 BMP-3 IFVs and BTR-82A APCs as well as more than 20 Tigr-M armored vehicles equipped with the Arbalet-DM combat module. The Ground Troops reportedly received 2,930 new or modernized systems allowing for two missile brigades, two SAM brigades and two SAM regiments, one Spetsnaz brigade, 12 motorized rifle and tank battalions, and three artillery divisions to be reequipped.\\n\\nSection::::Equipment summary.\\nThe following figures are sourced from http://warfare.be. Figures listed as \"Active\" only include equipment that is deemed serviceable and circulated in active service.\\n\\nSection::::Ranks and insignia.\\nThe newly re-emergent Russia retained most of the ranks of the Soviet Army, with some minor changes. The principal difference from the usual Western style is some variation in generals\\' rank titles—in at least one case, Colonel General, derived from German usage. Most of the rank names were borrowed from existing German/Prussian, French, English, Dutch, and Polish ranks upon the formation of Russian regular army in the late 17th century, and have lasted with few changes of title through the Soviet period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Russian Ground Forces', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1094752'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '3RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10947732', 'text': 'Abraham de Oliveira\\n\\nAbraham de Oliveira (4 May 1880 in Amsterdam – 26 March 1943 in Sobibor extermination camp, General Government (occupied Poland) was a Dutch gymnast who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics.

He also wrote a column syndicated by North American Newspaper Alliance, 1967-1970, and The New York Times, 1970-1973. Jahn wrote several works of nonfiction before the mid-1970s, when he switched to writing mystery/suspense fiction, eventually publishing about 50 novels and movie/TV adaptations, under his own name and several pen names. His first mystery novel, \"The Quark Maneuver\", published by Ballantine in 1977, won an Edgar Award in 1978. \\n\\nIn 1982 and using the byline Michael Jahn he began the series \"The Bill Donovan Mysteries\" with \"Night Rituals\". By 2008 he had published 10 novels in the series, the last being \"Donovan and Son,\" published by Five Star (Gale Centage) in 2008. \"The Bill Donovan Mysteries\" were highly acclaimed, and in 2011 he began reformatting them for publication in ebook edition (Kindle). By the end of 2012, six of the 10 had been published in digital format. \\n\\nWith the conclusion of the Donovan series he stopped writing fiction in order to concentrate on a memoir of the last century and a half of American history as reflected in the lives of his recent ancestors. They came from all over Western Europe and had adventures that included being part of the opening of Japan to Western civilization, the great sea battles of the Civil War, arctic exploration, the Roosevelts, the Lindberg baby trial, the Hindenberg Disaster, the American Communist Party, and brushes with Dutch Schultz, Harry Truman, and, in his words, \"a passel of currently deceased rock stars.\" \\n\\nJahn\\'s original manuscripts and papers are in the Michael Jahn Collection at the Rare Book & Manuscript Library of Columbia University.

Although the symptoms subside rapidly, commonly within 1 hour, CU may significantly impair quality of life, especially in relation to sporting activities.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Subtypes.\\nSection::::Sweat hypersensitivity.\\nThis subtype of CU refers to those who are hypersensitive to their own sweat.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nDiagnosis is made by injecting autologous (the person\\'s own) sweat into the skin.\\n\\nSection::::Features.\\nThe hives are observed to coincide with perspiration points of sweating.\\n\\nSection::::Pathophysiology.\\nTanaka et al. found that the sweat hyper-sensitivities of CU and atopic dermatitis seem to be virtually the same, and therefore, the sweat-induced histamine release from basophils may also be mediated by a specific IgE for sweat in atopic dermatitis as well as CU.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Acquired anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis.\\nThis subtype of CU refers to those who have abnormally reduced sweating.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nSweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body\\'s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through the use of a hot box ⁄ room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis (see Minor test).\\n\\nA skin biopsy may reveal cellular infiltrates in sweat glands or ducts.\\n\\nSection::::Features.\\nSevere heat intolerance (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and headache), and tingling, pricking, pinchy or burning pain over the entire body on exposure to hot environments or prolonged exercise which improve after cooling the body. Occurs in the absence of any causative skin, metabolic, or neurological disorders.\\n\\nSection::::Pathophysiology.\\n The wheals, hypohidrosis, and pain seems to result from the low expression levels of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 3 (CHRM3) in the eccrine gland epithelial cells.\\n\\nElevated expression levels of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC which result in chemoattracted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations to the surrounding area may be responsible for exerting a downmodulatory effect on the AchE and CHRM3 expressions.\\n\\nCorticosteroid inhibits the expressions of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC. This further support the notion that CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC play a crucial role.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Idiopathic.\\nUnknown or unclassified at this time. This represents those who do not fall under any of the above categories.\\n\\nSection::::Prevalence.\\nThough overall research is limited, various studies indicate that CU is relatively common across populations with prevalence rates reportedly ranging from 5% to 20% (depending on locale, race, and age). The condition is more common in young adults, and prevalence appears to peak in adults aged 26–28 (up to 20%). The vast majority of cases are reported to be mild, and proportionally few individuals seek medical attention regarding the condition.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nCU was first described by Duke in 1924 as \"urticaria calorica\". The term \"cholinergic\" is derived from the finding that hives similar to those of CU can be evoked using cholinergic agonists (e.g. methacholine).\\n\\n', 'title': 'Cholinergic urticaria', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10954421'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '4hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '109560', 'text': 'Tildenville, Florida\\n\\nTildenville is a census-designated place (CDP) and an unincorporated area in Orange County, Florida, United States.

Scholars estimate a date in the early 1620s; \"There is a strong case for a late 1624 or early 1625 date for the play.\" The play was entered into the Stationers\\' Register on 14 February 1639, and published in quarto later that year by the bookseller John Waterson; the title page states that it was acted by the King\\'s Men in the Globe Theatre. The quarto also bears Massinger\\'s dedication of the play to a personal friend, Sir Anthony St. Leger (or \"Sentleger\").\\n\\nIn search of a source for Massinger\\'s plot, critics have considered the story of Beatrice Cenci and a passage in Jonson\\'s \"\" that refers to \"incest, murders, rapes...incestuous life.\" Yet it is clear from the thinness of these connections that the plot of the play is \"Massinger\\'s own.\"\\n\\nScholars have studied \"The Unnatural Combat\" for resonances with the events of its era; it has been argued that the play\\'s portrait of its villain Malefort Senior alludes to the sex scandals and witchcraft allegations surrounding George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Also, in another possible anti-Buckingham thrust, the play may refer to the failed English expedition to Cadiz (1625); the dedicatee\\'s brother, Sir William St. Leger, was instrumental in the expedition and was critical of Buckingham\\'s conduct of it.\\n\\nThe play\\'s theme of incest has prevented it from gaining any status as a popular or often-revived drama. Nineteenth-century critics tended to condemn \"The Unnatural Combat\" for its sensational aspect; but T. S. Eliot praised the play\\'s \"deft handling of suspense\" and its \"theatrical skill.\"\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nThe play tells the story of the intertwined fates of two families, the Beauforts and Maleforts. Beaufort Senior is the governor of Marseilles in France; his son, Beaufort Junior, is in love with, and beloved by, Theocrine, the daughter of Malefort Senior, the admiral of Marseilles. The admiral\\'s son and Theocrine\\'s half-brother, Malefort Junior, is a successful and notorious pirate; at the start of the play his pirate fleet is blockading the harbor of the city, and his father the admiral is suspected of collusion with the son\\'s actions.\\n\\nThis situation is delineated in the play\\'s opening scene, which proceeds to the admiral\\'s trial before the governor and other officials. Malefort Senior reminds his judges of his many past victories and acts of courage, though to little effect. The trial is then interrupted by an emissary from the pirates, who bears a challenge: Malefort Junior challenges his father to single combat, which will decide the outcome of the pirates\\' siege. Malefort Senior agrees; it is a way for him to clear his reputation and refute the charges against him—but more than that, the challenge satisfies his bloody-minded nature. (This duel, of course, is the \"unnatural combat\" of the title.)\\n\\nMalefort Junior and his captains arrive for the duel. The pirates, talking among themselves, express their surprise at their leader\\'s course of action; they do not comprehend his motives. When Malefort Senior and Junior meet, they converse before the fight — and the son reproaches his father for having committed a \"deed of horror\" (though he doesn\\'t specify the nature of that horrible action). They duel; the father kills the son, and mutilates his body. The pirates withdraw, according to their agreement; Malefort Senior is cleared of the charges against him and hailed once more as the city\\'s hero.\\n\\nPlans are made for the wedding of Beaufort Junior and Theocrine; but their friends note the strange, doting, almost obsessive behavior that Malefort Senior has begun to show toward his daughter. A plan is hatched to distract the admiral at a banquet in his honor, and to take Theocrine aside for a quick marriage ceremony with her fiancé. But Malefort Senior is too suspicious and watchful to be fooled in this way, and he discovers and forestalls the intended ceremony. In a soliloquy, Malefort divulges that he is suddenly plagued with, and almost overcome by, lustful and incestuous desire for his daughter. In his confusion and distress, he appeals to his cynical friend Montreville, the commander of the city\\'s fortress. Malefort asks Montreville to take Theocrine into his custody, and has the man swear to keep them, father and daughter, separate, no matter how Malefort may change his mind, object, or plead to the contrary in the future.\\n\\nMontreville does as Malefort requests, but for his own dark motives; he abducts Theocrine and takes her to his fortress. When Malefort eventually, and inevitably, comes to the fortress to try to get her back, Montreville has her tossed out the front gate, her clothing disordered and hair disheveled; and Montreville cheerfully admits to having raped her. He reminds Malefort that he was once a rejected suitor for Theocrine\\'s hand, and gloats over his revenge. Montreville also reveals the sinister history the two men share, and the nature of the crime with which Malefort Junior had reproached his father on the \"field of honor.\" Years before, Malefort had fallen in love with Montreville\\'s mistress; to marry the woman, Malefort poisoned his first wife, his son\\'s mother. Malefort then married the mistress, who gave birth to Theocrine.\\n\\nTheocrine dies from the shock of her rape. Malefort, in his distraction, sees the ghosts of his son and his murdered first wife. A thunderstorm rises, and Malefort is struck by a bolt of lightning and killed on the spot. The forces of the governor, led by Beaufort Senior and Junior and other officials, assault and take the fortress; Montreville is led away to answer for his crime.\\n\\nThe tragic plot is varied with some elements of comic relief, from two sources. One is a group of Theocrine\\'s servants that includes her Usher, waiting women, and especially her Page; the other, and the more important one, is the figure of Belgarde, a cashiered captain who has to struggle for survival, cadging free meals wherever he can. Belgarde also supplies social commentary on the fates of soldiers and sailors who are no longer needed by society (relevant, perhaps, in the aftermath of the Cadiz campaign).\\n\\n', 'title': 'The Unnatural Combat', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10959108'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10960735', 'text': '1984–85 French Division 1\\n\\nGirondins de Bordeaux won Division 1 season 1984/1985 of the French Association Football League with 59 points.\\n\\n\\nSection::::League table.\\nPromoted from Division 2, who will play in Division 1 season 1985/1986\\n\\n', 'title': '1984–85 French Division 1', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10960735'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '109616', 'text': 'Pahokee, Florida\\n\\nPahokee is a city located on the shore of Lake Okeechobee in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States.

Such wagons formed part of a wagon train of settlers or fed traveling workers such as cowboys or loggers.\\n\\nIn modern times, chuckwagons feature in certain cooking competitions and events. Chuckwagons are also used in a type of horse racing known as chuckwagon racing. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nWhile some form of mobile kitchens had existed for generations, the invention of the chuckwagon is attributed to Charles Goodnight, a Texas rancher, the \"father of the Texas Panhandle,\" who introduced the concept in 1866. After the American Civil War, the beef market in Texas expanded. Some cattlemen herded cattle in parts of the country that did not have railroads which would mean they needed to be fed on the road for months at a time. Goodnight modified the Studebaker wagon, a durable army-surplus wagon, to suit the needs of cowboys driving cattle from Texas to sell in New Mexico. He added a \"chuck box\" to the back of the wagon with drawers and shelves for storage space and a hinged lid to provide a flat cooking surface. A water barrel was also attached to the wagon and canvas was hung underneath to carry firewood. A wagon box was used to store cooking supplies and cowboys\\' personal items.\\n\\nChuckwagon food typically included easy-to-preserve items like beans and salted meats, coffee, and sourdough biscuits. Food would also be gathered \"en route\". There was no fresh fruit, vegetables, or eggs available and meat was not fresh unless an animal was injured during the run and therefore had to be killed. The meat they ate was greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, and beef, usually dried, salted or smoked. The wagon was also stocked with a water barrel and a sling to kindle wood to heat and cook food. On cattle drives, it was common for the \"cookie\" who ran the wagon to be second in authority only to the \"trailboss.\" The cookie would often act as cook, barber, dentist, and banker.\\n\\nThe term \"chuck wagon\" comes from \"chuck\", a slang term for food, and not from the nickname for \"Charles\".\\n\\nSection::::Cook-offs.\\n \\nThe American Chuckwagon Association is an organization dedicated to the preservation of the heritage of the chuckwagon. Its members participate in chuckwagon cook-offs throughout much of the US. Through these events, the members educate the public on the history and traditions surrounding the chuckwagon.\\n\\nAt a chuckwagon cook off, each wagon is judged on the authenticity of the wagon. Wagons must be in sound drivable condition, with equipment and construction available in the late 1800s. Contents of the chuck-box, including utensils, must also match what would have been used during the era. Wagons are also judged on the attire of their cooks. A typical chuckwagon cookoff is composed of 5 food categories: Meat (usually chicken-fried steak), Beans (pinto), Bread (sourdough or yeast), Dessert (usually peach cobbler), and potatoes. A team of judges evaluates the entries from each wagon, giving each a score. Once scores are tabulated, prizes are awarded to the top wagons.\\n\\nOne of the most famous chuckwagon cook-offs is the Lincoln County Cowboy Symposium. Held annually for some two decades, this event attracts thousands to Ruidoso, New Mexico.\\n\\nAmong the few chuckwagon cook-offs east of the Mississippi River takes place during SaddleUp! each February in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Held just outside Great Smoky Mountains National Park, SaddleUp! also features a cowboy symphony and cowboy church services over a four-day period.\\n\\nThe Academy of Western Artists presents an annual award for outstanding chuckwagon cooking as well as honors in other fields relating to the culture of the American cowboy.\\n\\nSection::::Racing.\\nChuckwagon racing is an event at some rodeos mainly in Western Canada such as the Calgary Stampede. Chuckwagon races were held from 1952 until 1998 at Cheyenne Frontier Days, one of America\\'s biggest rodeos. There are a few professional chuckwagon racing circuits that operate in North America with the premiere circuit being run by the World Professional Chuckwagon Association (WPCA) based in Calgary, Alberta, the Western Chuckwagon Association out of Grande Prairie, AB, and Canadian Professional Chuckwagon Association out of Saskatchewan. A yearly chuckwagon race event is still held in Clinton, Arkansas. \\n\\nSo far the world\\'s most successful Chuckwagon champion is Kelly Sutherland, who won the Calgary Stampede 12 times - the Wayne Gretzky of Chuckwagon racing. He inherited this tough pioneering spirit from his grandparents Helen and Seath Sutherland who homesteaded about fifteen miles southwest of Grande Prairie, Alberta. They raised 12 children there and Seath drove a team of horses to deliver coal to feed his family during the depression. This he did after mining a coal seam from the banks of the Wapiti river. \\n\\nChuckwagons are raced around a figure eight barrel obstacle, and the stove and tent poles within the wagon must not be lost. The racing team also has from two to four \"outriders\" who load the stove and tent poles at the start and must finish the race with the chuckwagon. Many such races are held each year in Western Canadian cities and towns.\\n\\nSection::::Animal welfare.\\nChuckwagon racing is highlighted by animal welfare experts as dangerous to the horses, due to the unusually high risk of broken limbs and other bones. Horses die frequently as a result and animal welfare charities are trying to raise awareness about the sport in this light. In July 2011, a horse died in the chuckwagon race on the opening night of the Calgary Stampede.\\n\\nSection::::Chuckwagon suppers.\\nTourists, mostly in the summers, can experience chuckwagon suppers, sometimes followed by live entertainment, at locations across the Western United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Chuckwagon', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1096474'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '7RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10966207', 'text': 'Todd Lowber\\n\\nTodd Lowber (born January 26, 1982) is a former gridiron football wide receiver.

He learned to play the fiddle and flugelhorn in a band led by his father. Later he played these instruments in a military band. He started to compose in the 1920s while he worked as a bartender in a pub owned by his father-in-law. In 1929 he wrote the \"Modřanská polka\" named after Modřany, a suburb of Prague where it was played the first time. This catchy tune became a hit and allowed Vejvoda to pursue music as a full-time professional. It was published in 1934 with lyrics \"Škoda lásky, kterou jsem tobě dala...\" Publishing house Shapiro Bernstein acquired the rights shortly before World War II and the polka, now the \"Beer Barrel Polka\" with the English lyrics \"Roll out the barrel...\", became the most popular song of the Allies in the West, although the original Czech lyrics have a very different meaning and do not speak about beer. After the war this polka became popular around the world, in German-speaking countries as \"Rosamunde\".\\n\\nVejvoda wrote many other hits, such as \"Kdyby ty muziky nebyly\" (\"If those bands did not exist\") and \"Já ráda tancuju\" (\"I love to dance\") but none of them became popular outside of the Czech and German speaking countries.\\n\\nVejvoda had three sons: Jaromír, Jiří and Josef.

In December 2017, iHeartMedia assembled a trimulcast of KBPI along the Interstate 25 corridor on the 107.9 frequency, by moving KBPI\\'s main signal to 107.9 in Fort Collins, as well as to translator station K300CP in Denver, and switching KDZA in Pueblo/Colorado Springs to a simulcast of KBPI.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nKBPI started at 105.9\\xa0MHz in Denver on June 21, 1965. It had studios on the 20th floor of the D&F Tower in downtown Denver. The owner and general manager of the station was Bill Pierson, who named KBPI for \"Bill Pierson Incorporated.\" The station featured a progressive rock format. Pierson sold the station in 1974. The station continued its rock format under the new owner, Progressive Broadcasters, Incorporated.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the station moved to an album-oriented rock (AOR) sound. Its television commercials featured a blonde woman lip synching with bits of popular Rock songs and DJ\\'s voices, and the tagline \"KBPI Rocks the Rockies!\" (elongated with rolling R sounds). This catchphrase is still used in advertising and for a while the campaign was used at other rock radio stations in the United States and Canada. The \"blonde woman\" AKA \"KBPI\\'s Remarkable Mouth\" was Kelly Harmon, sister of actor Mark Harmon.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s, KBPI gained press for inviting people to bring their disco records to the station office for destruction, and this was frequently broadcast live over the air to the tune of Black Sabbath songs. This was commonplace among AOR stations who were riding the anti-Disco theme at the time. For four years, Steven B. and the Hawk ruled the Denver morning FM ratings, mixing rock music with their witty comments and routines. As they put it, \"It really didn\\'t matter what kind of music they played. Listeners tuned in to hear them.\"\\n\\nTheir comedic style was highlighted by a self-deprecating sense of humor, rather than \"shock jock talk.\" The duo ridiculed the entertainment industry, regularly parodying movie and TV stars. One of their favorite routines was an ongoing spoof of soap operas. They created their own ongoing series, whose titles were partially taken from the real shows that aired at the time: \"Edge of Guiding Days of My Children Turning Hospital\". They also did commercials featuring \"Whamco\" products and promotions.\\n\\nDon Hawkins died unexpectedly in November 1994, following a routine surgery. Steven B. Williams, who had become a nationally prominent voiceover artist for television stations and networks including Nick at Nite and moved to California, was found dead of a gunshot wound in May 2006 off Catalina Island, and a business associate who embezzled the inheritance of Williams\\'s father was convicted of his murder in 2011.\\n\\nOn April 20, 1994, Chancellor Media moved KBPI to 106.7 FM, which had been the home of KAZY, its long-time rock competitor and a former sister station to KLZ-AM-TV. Notable DJs include Willie B., DMac, Marc Stout, Scoop, Missy, Uncle Nasty, Matt Need, Double A Ron, Dan, Tim Bourke, Eddie, Joe the Russian and B Lo.\\n\\nSection::::Move to 106.7.\\n106.7 FM signed the air on June 19, 1962 as KLZ-FM. At first it simulcast its AM counterpart, 560 KLZ. But in the early 1970s, it started airing a rock format. In 1977, KLZ-FM changed its call sign to KAZY (now at 93.7 FM in Cheyenne, Wyoming) and continued with a rock format until KBPI moved to the frequency on April 20, 1994 (105.9 would then flip to Hot AC as KALC).\\n\\nDean and Rog hosted the KBPI Morning Show from 1991 to 1996. They were known for features like \"The Birthday Scam\" and \"Torture Tuesday\", as well as other stunts. In 1996, the duo and two other station employees were charged with disorderly conduct for entering a mosque while playing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on a bugle and trumpet. This was in response to Nuggets player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\\'s refusal to stand for the anthem before games.\\n\\nAfter more than twenty years with a mainstream album rock sound, KBPI shifted to active rock in late 1995, calling its new format \"The New Music Revolution.\" At the time, KBPI had an Alternative rock lean. A few years later, KBPI would bring back the old slogan \"Rocks the Rockies.\"\\n\\nIn 2007, the station was nominated for \"Radio & Records\" Industry Achievement Award for best active rock station in a top 25 market.\\n\\nSection::::Move to 107.9.\\nOn July 27, 1975, 107.9 FM first signed on as KCOL-FM. It was the sister station to AM 1410 KCOL (now on AM 600). KCOL-FM aired a beautiful music format. In 1988, the station switched to a Top 40 format as KIMN, which were the call letters of a popular Top 40 station in Denver in past years. The station took the call letters KPAW in 1995, at first keeping its Top 40 sound, then moving to classic hits around 2000, and later to classic rock.\\n\\nIn December 2017, iHeartMedia launched a trimulcast of KBPI, utilizing the analog 107.9 frequency across several markets in the Interstate 25 corridor. On December 5, the programming and call letters of classic rock KPAW, which targets Fort Collins and the Northern Front Range, was moved to KYWY (92.9) in Cheyenne, Wyoming (which moved its adult contemporary format to KOLT-HD2 (100.7-HD2) and translator station K246CI (97.1) four days prior).\\n\\nOn December 11, KBPI\\'s programming and call letters then moved to the 107.9 frequency vacated by KPAW and co-channel Denver translator K300CP, while sister station KDZA in Pueblo, which also serves Colorado Springs, flipped to a simulcast of KBPI (and switched their calls to KBPL the following month). The previous 106.7 signal, which warehoused the KYWY call letters, simulcasted KBPI for a week before flipping to country as KWBL on December 18, 2017. The move of the station in Denver from the 106.7 full-power signal to a 107.9 translator that barely covers most of Denver proper has been criticized by metro listeners due to reception and audio quality issues.\\n\\nSection::::K300CP history.\\nThe K300CP translator launched early as 2015 in as an FM translator of KOA (850) until November 1, 2015, when KOA was switched to the newly-acquired K231BQ (94.1). After a simulcast of Christmas music from the HD2 subchannel of KRFX (103.5) through the holidays, it began to translate the sports radio format of KDSP (760) until December 11, 2017, when it converted to a simulcast of KPTT-HD2.

Moore was especially active in setting up the Army Community Service organizations that are now a permanent fixture on all army posts and which assist each soldier as they process into their new duty stations.\\n\\nSection::::Casualty notification.\\nThe Ia Drang Campaign was the first major ground engagement involving U.S. forces in Vietnam. The Army had not yet set up an adequate system of notifying the next of kin of battlefield fatalities. Instead, the telegrams were given to taxicab drivers for delivery, as depicted in the film \"We Were Soldiers\". Unlike the film depiction, Moore did not actually assume responsibility for the delivery of the telegrams, however, she accompanied the cab drivers who delivered the telegrams and assisted in the death notifications, grieving with the widows and families of men killed in battle, and attended the funerals of those who fell under her husband\\'s command. Her complaints to the Pentagon, and the example that she set, prompted the Army to immediately set up notification teams consisting of a uniformed officer and a chaplain.\\n\\nSection::::Death.\\nMoore died on April 18, 2004 and is buried at the Fort Benning Cemetery, near her mother and father, and in the middle of the 7th Cavalry troopers, beside the grave of SGT Jack E.

The first formal school was built in 1874 on land that was also donated by Progar Debogory. A new one-room school was built by 1903 in replacement of the original schoolhouse. In 1924, a new building was built out of bricks and had 4 rooms to accommodate more students. In 1941, principal W.L. Seig developed a unique 4-H program focused on the development of home economics and farming skills. This program was sponsored by Rollins College and this accomplishment is acknowledged and praised in the \"History of the Seminole County Public Schools\". In 1988, an elementary school was built surrounding the old brick schoolhouse. The old schoolhouse was preserved for the community and in 1995 it served as a family resource center.

Form is an external thing, be it ever so good, and\\nthus it may lapse into misuse; but then it is no longer an orderly form,\\nbut a disorder; so that no external order stands and avails at all of\\nitself, as hitherto the papal forma are judged to have done, but all forma\\nhave their life, worth, strength, and virtues in proper use; or else they\\nare of no avail and value whatever\" (Werke, Weimar ed., xix. 72 aqq.).\\nAccording to Lutheran ecclesiastical teaching (Formula of Concord,\\nII; \"Solida declaratio\", x.; Apology, xiv.; Melanchthon\\'s \"Loci\", 2d\\nredaction in \"CR\", xxi. 555-556; the Saxon \"Visitationsbuch\" of 1528; etc.) a\\nuniform liturgy is requisite only in so far as it is indispensable to uphold proper doctrine and the administration of the sacraments; whereas in general the rightful appointment of the external functions of church officers and their sphere in the congregations is committed to the church\\ngoverning board of the state authorities. The spontaneous development of\\nchurch law, and especially the regulation of divine service, the\\nsacraments, and discipline, as Luther ideally conceived it, proved\\nimpracticable, and gave place, though not invariably so, to definition on\\nthe part of temporal sovereigns. All these regulations, especially those of\\ngovernments and cities, by means of which the canonical church forms that\\nhad previously prevailed in the land were modified in a reformatory\\ndirection, while the newly developing church system became progressively\\nestablished, are called \"Church Orders\". Those of the sixteenth century\\nare the most important.\\n\\nA Church Order usually begins with a dogmatic part in which the agreement of the State Church with the general Lutheran confessions is set forth with more or less of detail (\"Credenda\"); then follow regulations concerning\\nliturgy, the appointment of church officers, organization of church government, discipline, marriage, schools, the pay of church and school officials, the administration of church property, care of the poor, etc. (\"Agenda\"). A systematic topical arrangement is by no means always adhered to.

As the post had not yet been established in law, he formally served as Minister without Portfolio for the first three months. His appointment was aimed to appeal to liberal minded opinion but was criticised as being inappropriate - A.J.P. Taylor described Burgin as being \"another horse from Caligula\\'s well-stocked stables\" (a follow-up to contemporary remarks about the earlier appointment of Sir Thomas Inskip as Minister for Coordination of Defence). When Chamberlain was replaced by Winston Churchill, Burgin was not included in the new wartime ministry.\\n\\nBurgin was referred to in the book \"Guilty Men\" by Michael Foot, Frank Owen and Peter Howard (writing under the pseudonym \\'Cato\\'), published in 1940 as an attack on public figures for their failure to re-arm and their appeasement of Nazi Germany. \\n\\nHe retired at the 1945 general election before dying in August 1945, aged 58.\\n', 'title': 'Leslie Burgin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1099828'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10999492', 'text': \"Vazrazhdane\\n\\nVazrazhdane () is a district in the centre of Sofia. it has 49,158 inhabitants.

They were discovered in brain extracts in the 1870s and were named after the mythological sphinx because of their enigmatic nature. These compounds play important roles in signal transduction and cell recognition. Sphingolipidoses, or disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, have particular impact on neural tissue. A sphingolipid with an R group consisting of a hydrogen atom only is a ceramide. Other common R groups include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers, yielding cerebrosides and globosides, respectively. Cerebrosides and globosides are collectively known as glycosphingolipids.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nThe long-chain bases, sometimes simply known as sphingoid bases, are the first non-transient products of \"de novo\" sphingolipid synthesis in both yeast and mammals. These compounds, specifically known as phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (also known as sphinganine, although this term is less common), are mainly C compounds, with somewhat lower levels of C bases. Ceramides and glycosphingolipids are \"N\"-acyl derivatives of these compounds.\\n\\nThe sphingosine backbone is O-linked to a (usually) charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline.\\n\\nThe backbone is also amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid.\\n\\nSection::::Types.\\nSimple sphingolipids, which include the sphingoid bases and ceramides, make up the early products of the sphingolipid synthetic pathways.\\n\\nComplex sphingolipids may be formed by addition of head groups to ceramide or phytoceramide: \\n\\nSection::::Mammalian sphingolipid metabolism.\\n\"De novo\" sphingolipid synthesis begins with formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. However, studies have demonstrated that serine palmitoyltransferase has some activity toward other species of fatty acyl-CoA and alternative amino acids, and the diversity of sphingoid bases has recently been reviewed. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by a (dihydro)-ceramide synthase, such as Lass1p or Lass2p (also termed as CerS), to form dihydroceramide. This is desaturated to form ceramide.\\n\\nCeramide may subsequently have several fates. It may be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate. Alternatively, it may be glycosylated by glucosylceramide synthase or galactosylceramide synthase. Additionally, it can be converted to sphingomyelin by the addition of a phosphorylcholine headgroup by sphingomyelin synthase. Diacylglycerol is generated by this process. Finally, ceramide may be broken down by a ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate. This may be dephosphorylated to reform sphingosine.\\n\\nBreakdown pathways allow the reversion of these metabolites to ceramide. The complex glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide. These lipids are then hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases to regenerate ceramide. Similarly, sphingomyelin may be broken down by sphingomyelinase to form ceramide.\\n\\nThe only route by which sphingolipids are converted to non-sphingolipids is through sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This forms ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.\\n\\nSection::::Functions of mammalian sphingolipids.\\nSphingolipids are commonly believed to protect the cell surface against harmful environmental factors by forming a mechanically stable and chemically resistant outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Certain complex glycosphingolipids were found to be involved in specific functions, such as cell recognition and signaling. Cell recognition depends mainly on the physical properties of the sphingolipids, whereas signaling involves specific interactions of the glycan structures of glycosphingolipids with similar lipids present on neighboring cells or with proteins.\\n\\nRecently, simple sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, have been shown to be important mediators in the signaling cascades involved in apoptosis, proliferation, stress responses, necrosis, inflammation, autophagy, senescence, and differentiation. Ceramide-based lipids self-aggregate in cell membranes and form separate phases less fluid than the bulk phospholipids. These sphingolipid-based microdomains, or \"lipid rafts\" were originally proposed to sort membrane proteins along the cellular pathways of membrane transport. At present, most research focuses on the organizing function during signal transduction.\\n\\nSphingolipids are synthesized in a pathway that begins in the ER and is completed in the Golgi apparatus, but these lipids are enriched in the plasma membrane and in endosomes, where they perform many of their functions. Transport occurs via vesicles and monomeric transport in the cytosol. Sphingolipids are virtually absent from mitochondria and the ER, but constitute a 20-35 molar fraction of plasma membrane lipids.\\n\\nIn experimental animals, feeding sphingolipids inhibits colon carcinogenesis, reduces LDL cholesterol and elevates HDL cholesterol.\\n\\nSection::::Yeast sphingolipids.\\nBecause of the incredible complexity of mammalian systems, yeast are often used as a model organism for working out new pathways. These single-celled organisms are often more genetically tractable than mammalian cells, and strain libraries are available to supply strains harboring almost any non-lethal open reading frame single deletion. The two most commonly used yeasts are \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", although research is also done in the pathogenic yeast \"Candida albicans\".\\n\\nIn addition to the important structural functions of complex sphingolipids (inositol phosphorylceramide and its mannosylated derivatives), the sphingoid bases phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) play vital signaling roles in \"S. cerevisiae\". These effects include regulation of endocytosis, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (and, thus, regulation of nutrient uptake ), cytoskeletal dynamics, the cell cycle, translation, posttranslational protein modification, and the heat stress response. Additionally, modulation of sphingolipid metabolism by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate signaling \"via\" Slm1p and Slm2p and calcineurin has recently been described. Additionally, a substrate-level interaction has been shown between complex sphingolipid synthesis and cycling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate by the phosphatidylinositol kinase Stt4p and the lipid phosphatase Sac1p.\\n\\nSection::::Plant sphingolipids.\\nHigher plants contain a wider variety of sphingolipids than animals and fungi.\\n\\nSection::::Disorders.\\nThere are several disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, known as sphingolipidoses. The main members of this group are Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, Gaucher disease, Tay–Sachs disease and Metachromatic leukodystrophy. They are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, but notably Fabry disease is X-linked. Taken together, sphingolipidoses have an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000, but substantially more in certain populations such as Ashkenazi Jews. Enzyme replacement therapy is available to treat mainly Fabry disease and Gaucher disease, and people with these types of sphingolipidoses may live well into adulthood. The other types are generally fatal by age 1 to 5 years for infantile forms, but progression may be mild for juvenile- or adult-onset forms.\\n\\nSphingolipids have also been implicated with the frataxin protein (Fxn), the deficiency of which is associated with Friedreich\\'s ataxia (FRDA). Loss of Fxn in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA. Other research has demonstrated that iron accumulation in the nervous systems of flies enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Sphingolipid', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1100216'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11004306', 'text': \"Shrinking the footprint\\n\\nShrinking the footprint is a campaign by the Church of England to reduce its carbon footprint.\\n\\nThe campaign is being led by the Bishop of London, Dr Richard Chartres and was launched on World Environment Day in June 2006 with an invitation to all churches to carry out an energy audit and debate energy-related issues.

The population was 4,962 at the 2010 census. Named after one of the founders who contributed a site and paid for the county courthouse, the city was established in 1871, and is the county seat of Dodge County.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, this was a center of the timber and sawmill industry. During the Great Depression in 1937, the first Stuckey\\'s Pecan Shoppe, once well-known along roadways throughout the United States, was founded in Eastman.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe first permanent settlement of the area took place in 1840. The population continued to grow when, in 1869, a station was built for the newly constructed Macon and Brunswick Railroad which passed through the area, stimulating an economic boom. The settlement was originally named Levison and was renamed Eastman by December 1869.\\nEastman was designated as the seat of newly formed Dodge County in 1871. It was incorporated as a town in 1873 and as a city in 1905. Eastman is named for W. P. Eastman, who, with W. E. Dodge, presented the county with a courthouse.\\n\\nDuring that same time period, Ira Roe Foster, former Quartermaster General of Georgia, operated a sawmill in Dodge County. In 1869, Foster built a residence in what would become Eastman. Foster was one of many who came to the area to participate in the timber and sawmill boom.\\n\\nDuring the boom, it was estimated that, on average, there was one mill every two miles along the industrial corridor created by the Macon and Brunswick Railroad. Unlike earlier eras, when timber was transported downstream in large river rafts, sawmills along the industrial corridor shipped their timber by rail. In his book \"The New South Comes to Wiregrass Georgia 1860-1910\", author Mark V. Wetherington states: \"Ira R. Foster shipped lumber to Brunswick, where it was loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana.\" When Eastman was incorporated in 1872, Foster served as its first mayor.\\n\\nIn the early years of the 20th century, racial tensions increased between the white and black communities in and about Eastman, resulting in a number of documented lynchings. In one instance, a man misidentified as the rapist Ed Claus was murdered before the real Claus was identified, apprehended, and lynched. In 1919, rumors that local blacks were intending to rise up and exterminate white residents, led to the murder of Eli Cooper and the burning of several black churches, which were believed to be the focal point of the uprising.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nEastman is located in the center of Dodge County at (32.197760, -83.179271).

The name is taken from Bryce Canyon—a rugged region with many of the same landscapes that were first simulated with the software.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe original Bryce software arose from work with fractal geometry to create realistic computer images of mountain ranges and coastlines. An initial set of fractal based programs were developed by Ken Musgrave (who later created MojoWorld) a student of Benoît Mandelbrot, and extended by Eric Wenger. Wenger later met and worked with software artist Kai Krause to design a basic user interface. The first commercial version, Bryce 1.0, appeared in 1994 for the Macintosh.\\n\\nBryce 2.0, shipped in 1996, included much beyond the original notion of creating a realistic mountain range. These included independent light sources, complex atmospheric effects, the addition of primitive forms with Boolean methods to combine them, and a revamped Texture Editor. Bryce 2.0 was also ported to the Windows platform, although the first stable version, 2.1, was not released until 1997.\\n\\nThe ability to animate a scene was added (in a stable form) with the cross-platform Bryce 3D (version 3.1) in 1997 by the newly formed MetaCreations Corporation. A \"camera object\" unseen in the final image acted as the observer. The camera can be held in one place for a single image, or sent on a trajectory with images being rendered at many locations. The collection of images created along the camera\\'s trajectory are combined to create a realistic animation simulating a journey through a dynamic world.\\n\\nIn 1999 Bryce 4.0 was released with major improvements in the handling of atmospheres and skies, textures and also in the import/export of objects.\\n\\nIn 2000 Bryce was purchased by Corel Corporation. Corel released version 5 of Bryce in 2001, which included several new features, like Tree Lab and metaballs. Soon followed a patch to version 5.01, which fixed some bugs and added a few undocumented features.\\n\\nIn 2004, the software was sold again, to DAZ 3D. In 2005, DAZ 3D released Bryce 5.5 which included the DAZ Studio Character plugin. This integration between DAZ\\'s application for the manipulation of 3D models, DAZ Studio, and Bryce allowed users to import content from DAZ Studio and Poser, complete with all materials including transparencies, directly into Bryce thus making it easier to have human figures in Bryce scenes.\\n\\nIn October 2006, DAZ 3D released Bryce 6.0 and has released an update (6.1), this includes a Mac Intel compatible update. New features include animation import, support for dual-processor systems as well as hyper-threading, random replicate tool, advanced terrain editing, HDRI support and other tweaks. The interface remained largely the same, but with a green tint to it, and different buttons in the create palette.\\n\\nIn June 2007, DAZ 3D re-released Bryce 5.5 as a freeware.\\n\\nIn Summer 2009, DAZ 3D released version 3 of DAZ Studio. This version seemed to break Bryce 6.1.\\n\\nIn December 2009, DAZ 3D released Bryce 6.3 which improved stability, and added support for Mac OS X v10.6.\\n\\nBryce 7 was released in July 2010. New features include the Instancing Lab and advanced lighting. Updated features include the DAZ Studio Bridge, the Sky Lab, clouds and HDRI. Bryce 7 is available in three versions, a limited free version, a standard version lacking the new features and a pro version with the new features. Bryce 7 is not currently compatible with OS X Lion (10.7), Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9) (except for Bryce 7 Personal Limited Edition 7.1.0.74), thus the newest version of OS X it is compatible with is Snow Leopard (10.6).\\n\\nSection::::Features.\\nBryce 7 features:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Bryce (software)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1100885'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1101071', 'text': 'ITAA\\n\\nITAA may refer to the following:\\n\\n', 'title': 'ITAA', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1101071'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11011327', 'text': 'California Hard\\n\\nCalifornia Hard is a jazz album by pianist and composer Dolo Coker, recorded in 1976.

Dharamshala is the administrative headquarters of the district. It is the home of the Masrur Temples, also known as the Himalayan Pyramids.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nKangra is known for having the oldest serving Royal Dynasty in the world, the Katoch. In 1758, Raja Ghamand Chand\\nwas appointed \"nazim\" or governor of Jullundur Doab under the Afghans. Ghamand Chand was a brave and strong ruler who restored the prestige of Kangra. As he was unable to capture Kangra fort, he built another fort at Tira Sujanpur on the left bank of the Beas, almost opposite to Alampur on a hill overlooking the town. He died in 1774 and was succeeded by his son, Tegh Chand, who died too soon in 1775. Kangra was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s Sikh Empire in 1810. Kangra became a district of British India in 1846, when it was ceded to British India at the conclusion of the First Anglo-Sikh War. The British district included the present-day districts of Kangra, Hamirpur, Kullu, and Lahul and Spiti. Kangra District was part of the British province of Punjab. The administrative headquarters of the district were initially at Kangra, but were moved to Dharamshala in 1855.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nAccording to the 2011 census Kangra district has a population of 1,507,223, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii. This gives it a ranking of 331st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was 12.56%. Kangra has a sex ratio of 1013 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 86.49%.\\n\\nDistrict Highlights of 2011 Census\\n\\nThe native people are the Kangri people and the native language is Kangri, which is very similar to Dogri. The majority of the people are Hindu Brahmin, Rajput, Chaudhary, Banias and SC/OBC, although many Tibetans and others who follow Buddhism have also settled here recently. There are also minority populations of Sikhs, Muslims, and Christians.\\n\\nJhamakda is a folk dance of Kangra. It is exclusively performed by women. It features percussion instruments and songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Climate.\\nIt is situated in Western Himalayas between latitude 31°2΄-32°5΄ N,longitude 75°-75°45΄ E.

In 1949, he graduated from Indiana University with a degree in business administration and accepted a job with a development company in Akron. In 1955, he and his brother, David H. Jacobs, started a general contracting company that concentrated on the building of small strip malls. The company grew rapidly and by 1992, the Jacobs Group ranked fourth in the nation in the development and management of enclosed malls owning 40 malls in 16 states outright; they also owned 31 Wendy’s fast-food restaurants and several Marriott hotels. The Jacobs Group company builds and leases shopping centers, offices, and hotels. Among its properties are Key Tower and Westgate Mall in Cleveland, Ohio, and Triangle Town Center in Raleigh, North Carolina. His company also built Westland Mall, Northland Mall, and Eastland Mall in Columbus, Ohio.\\n\\nAlong with his brother, Jacobs was also well known for owning the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 1999. Progressive Field, formerly Jacobs Field, in Cleveland bore his family name from its opening in 1994 until early 2008.

Produced by Leonard Cohen and Henry Lewy, it was a return to Cohen\\'s acoustic folk music after the Phil Spector experimentation of \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\", but now with many jazz and Oriental influences.\\n\\nSection::::Recording and composition.\\nAfter recording \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\" with Phil Spector, a chaotically recorded album that would garner Cohen the worst reviews of his career, the singer decided to produce his next album himself with assistance from Henry Levy, a German who had previously worked regularly with Joni Mitchell. The album included Gypsy violin player Raffi Hakopian, English string arranger Jeremy Lubbock, Armenian oud player (located in Los Angeles) John Bilezikjian and even a Mexican Mariachi band. Long-time Cohen collaborator Jennifer Warnes appeared prominently in vocal tracks. Members of the band Passenger, whom Cohen also met through Mitchell, played on four of the songs. Garth Hudson of The Band also appeared on the album.\\n\\nUnlike the psychodrama evident on the Spector-dominated \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\", \"Recent Songs\", which was recorded at A&M Studios in Hollywood in the spring of 1979, sounds lucid by comparison. In the book \"Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life\", oud player John Bilezikjian recalls to author Anthony Reynolds, \"Sessions started in the afternoon and we\\'d go into the evenings. No drinking, that I saw, no visitors. Finished at a reasonable time, no early hours stuff...He let me do whatever it was I wanted to do. He trusted my sense of musicality. He would be with a microphone and headphones and we\\'d all be wired up in our separate booths and we\\'d listen and add our part.\" The album had a largely acoustic, Eastern-tinged flavor and was augmented by the singing of Jennifer Warnes and newcomer Sharon Robinson, who would go on to become one of Cohen\\'s favorite musical collaborators.\\n\\n\"Came So Far For Beauty\" originated from Cohen\\'s collaboration with \"New Skin for the Old Ceremony\" producer John Lissauer for a project called \"Songs For Rebecca\", which was scrapped (Lissauer received co-writing credit). In the liner notes to the album, Cohen thanks his Zen Master Roshi for inspiring one of the songs: \"I owe my thanks to Joshu Sasaki upon whose exposition of an early Chinese text I based \\'Ballad of the Absent Mare.\\'\" The metaphoric lyrics are based on the twelfth-century \"Ten Bulls\" (or \"Ten Ox-herding Pictures\"). According to Anthony Reynolds 2010 Cohen memoir, \"The Guests\" was based on a 13th-century Persian poem and was chosen to open the album because of the enthusiastic response it had evoked when Cohen played it to friends. The album also features Cohen\\'s interpretation of \"Un Canadien errant\", a song written in 1842 by Antoine Gérin-Lajoie after the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–38. Curiously, Cohen and Levy opted to use a Mexican Mariachi band on the song, which is arguably the only cheerful sonic outburst on what is otherwise a languid album (the Mariachi band is also employed more subtly on \"The Guests\" and \"The Ballad of the Absent Mare\"). Cohen\\'s 2004 song \"The Faith\" is based on the same folk tune a \"Un Canadien errant,\" with Cohen\\'s collaborator Anjani Thomas acknowledging in a 2005 interview (Old Ideas: Notes on \"Dear Heather\") that he used an alternate 1979 track for \"Un Canadien errant\", adding a new vocal line with completely new lyrics, for his 2004 album \"Dear Heather\". Cohen also recorded a studio version of the disco-infused \"Do I Have to Dance All Night,\" which had been previously released as a live single in France in 1976, but it was not included on the album.\\n\\nThe musicians who recorded \"Recent Songs\" with Cohen served as his tour band later that year, highlights of which can be heard on the 2001 release \"\". Cohen performed several songs from the LP in concert, such as \"The Guests,\" \"The Window,\" and the Sinatraesque \"The Smokey Life.\" Speaking with \"Mojo\"\\'s Sylvie Simmons in 2001, Cohen was effusive in his praise for the album:\\n\\nThe painting of Cohen on the album cover is by the artist Dianne Lawrence. \"The Guests\" would be the opening song of Cohen\\'s 1983 made-for-TV short musical \"I Am a Hotel\", which would also feature \"The Gypsy\\'s Wife\" as part of the narration.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\n\"Recent Songs\" received warm reviews and was viewed as a return to form by many critics after the shocking \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\". At the time of the album\\'s release, \"The New York Times\" said it provided \"an ideal musical idiom for his idiosyncrasies\" and listed it among its top ten records of 1979. In the original 1980 \"Rolling Stone\" review, Debra Rae Cohen enthused, \"There\\'s not a cut on \"Recent Songs\" without something to offer...and at least four or five tunes are full-fledged masterpieces. I wish I had a tape loop of \"The Guests,\" which features a hold-your-breath, haunting melody.\" William Ruhlmann of Allmusic observes, \"His writing had become increasingly bitter and angry during the 1970s in the books \"The Energy of Slaves\" and \"Death of a Lady\\'s Man\" as well as in his lyrics, but there was a new equanimity in these \"Recent Songs\" that began with the welcoming introduction of \\'The Guests\\'...The album was full of references to absence and dislocation, but Cohen deliberately countered them with humor.\" Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds takes a dim view of the collection, writing in 2010, \"For all its artistry, \"Recent Songs\" sounded bland and MOR...the album as a whole ploughed a self-indulgent, middling trough.\" The LP peaked at # 24 in Austria (where it went gold) and hit #56 in Germany.\\n\\nSection::::Cover versions.\\n\"Ballad of the Absent Mare\" has been covered by several artists, notably Emmylou Harris on the album \"Cowgirl\\'s Prayer\" (as \"Ballad of a Runaway Horse\") and Perla Batalla feat. David Hidalgo on the album \"Bird on the Wire: the Songs of Leonard Cohen\". Martha Wainwright performs a cover version of the song \"The Traitor\" in the tribute film \"\". Nana Mouskouri has covered the song on several albums (\"Song for Liberty\", \"Vivre Avec Toi\", \"I\\'ll Remember You\", \"The Rose\") and also sung the song in translation, for instance as \"Das Fest\" on her German language album \"Ich hab gelacht, ich hab geweint\".

The battalion was organized and under the command of only three captains. The other officers that were supplied to the unit were second lieutenants from the 1943 class of West Point. Shortly after, the battalion participated in two maneuvers in Louisiana, known as the \"Louisiana Maneuvers\"; there the battalion and its soldiers learned valuable lessons for war.\\n\\nThe 249th sailed from the United States to England in May 1944, after equipping and preparing for combat, the Unit landed on Utah Beach in August 1944 under the 1137th Engineer Combat Group commanded by Colonel George A. Morris. In October through November 1944, the soldiers were specially trained on using the Bailey bridge in Trier, France.\\n\\nLater that year on 18 December 1944, the Black Lions were ordered to move from the Saar River, where the unit was building a bridge, to the Ardennes, commonly called the Battle of the Bulge. Upon arriving to the front, the 249th was assigned to the 26th Infantry Division, already engaged and in defensive positions along the southeast corner of the Bulge. The battalion was used in an effort to block the German advance by deploying landmines, obstacles and establishing roadblocks.\\n\\nOn 24 December 1944, Brigadier General Harlan Harkness, the assistant division commander, ordered the battalion to advance and secure the towns of Arsdorf and Bigonville to the north of the 26th Infantry Division, near the area of operations of the 4th Armored Division, in order to relieve the occupied towns so the division could advance and attack the enemy line. Companies A and C were ordered into the town of Arsdorf where the battalion was engaged in fierce combat for two days. It was later learned that the town had never been secured by the 4th Armored Division.\\n\\nIn February 1945, the battalion was selected for the special task of crossing the Rhine River. On 19 March 1945, the unit was assigned to the engineer task force charged with crossing the Rhine at Oppenheim. The main thrust of the effort was to use assault boats to get troops from 5th Infantry Division across and later to construct a more stable pontoon bridge. The battalion met little resistance across the river and quickly began constructing the bridge. After an accident resulting in a raft being sunk, the Battalion moved downriver to Mainz. After this bridge site was secure, the 249th was detached from the 1137th Engineer Group and was given the mission to secure and maintain the bridges on the Rhine River. In May 1945, when the war ended in Europe, the battalion was moved to Plattling, Germany where they built a camp for displaced refugees. In November 1945, the 249th Engineers were sent on their final orders to Camp Lucky Strike, near Marseilles, France and then redeployed back to the United States. The division was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on 27 November 1945.\\n\\nSection::::Post World War II.\\nIn late 1954, the Black Lion Battalion was withdrawn from the Reserves and assigned to the Regular Army. In February 1955, it was activated and assigned to USAREUR and an Engineer Battalion (Combat Heavy). From 1955 until 1960, the 249th Engineer Battalion (Construction) was stationed at Kleber Kaserne, ((Kaiserslautern, Germany)). Then it was dispatched to France for a time. Then the battalion was stationed at Gerszewski Barracks, Knielingen, Karlsruhe, Germany, under the command of the 18th Engineer Brigade, where it provided construction support to USAREUR elements stationed in Germany for the Cold War.\\n\\nSection::::As a prime power battalion.\\nIn 1994, the battalion was reactivated and designated as the 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power), stationed at Fort Belvoir, VA.\\n\\nSection::::9/11.\\nImmediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, elements of the 249th were deployed to New York City and were instrumental in restoring power to Wall Street enabling the financial district to resume operations within a week of the attack.\\n\\nSection::::Global War on Terrorism.\\nThe 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) provides oversight on all coalition operating base power projects in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom).\\n\\nSection::::Hurricane Katrina.\\nThe 249th deployed teams to the Gulf Region under Joint Task Force Katrina, working with contractors, and local and state entities to assess, they helped install and maintain emergency generators at critical facilities.

All of these routes were ultimately converted to rubber tire bus operations, and many were consolidated, extended into newly developed areas, or otherwise reconfigured to keep up with the ridership demands of the times. Additional routes and extensions were added in later years to serve newly developed communities and to feed into Metro and Light Rail stations.\\n\\nWith the growth in popularity of the private automobile during the 20th century, streetcar and bus ridership declined, and the needs for public transportation changed. Mass transit in Baltimore and other cities shifted from a corporate operation to a tax-subsidized, state-run service. The amount of service provided was greatly reduced. Some areas once served by streetcars are now served minimally by buses or not at all.\\n\\nThe demise of the Baltimore streetcar took place between the years of 1947 and 1963, hastened by National City Lines' acquisition, which said that buses offered lower maintenance and had greater flexibility in traffic.

The company was purchased in 1948 by National City Lines and the streetcar system was then run down in favor of buses, a process repeated in many places, which became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal. The last streetcar ran in 1963. BTCO was absorbed by what is now the Maryland Transit Administration in 1970. The BTC oversaw the elimination of streetcar service in favor of bus service in 1963 when the last streetcar routes, the number 8 providing service from Catonsville to Towson and the number 15 (Overlea to Walbrook Junction) were eliminated.\\n\\nIn the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, the BTCO fired a white bus driver who claimed to be the Grand Wizard of the Baltimore Ku Klux Klan.

A part of the uppermost portion of the river channel was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1966.\\n\\nSection::::Geological history.\\nLake Agassiz was formed from the meltwaters of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Wisconsin glaciation of the last ice age. Agassiz was an enormous body of water, up to deep, and at various times covering areas totaling over . Blocked by an ice sheet to the north, the lake water rose until about 13,500 BP calibrated (11,700 C uncalibrated) years ago when it overtopped the \"Big Stone Moraine\", a ridge of glacial drift left by the receding glacier, at the location of Browns Valley, Minnesota. The lake\\'s outflow was catastrophic, and carved a gorge through the moraine wide and deep, which is now known as the Traverse Gap. The channel through the moraine, between Lake Traverse and Big Stone Lake, is now crossed by the divide between the watersheds of the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay. Its significance was recognized by designation as a National Natural Landmark under the Historic Sites Act.\\n\\nFrom Traverse Gap issued Glacial River Warren. From its inception until final abandonment of Agassiz\\' southern outlet, this stream drained the meltwater of that lake to the Mississippi valley. The drainage was not continuous, as Lake Agassiz periodically had other outlets. The Laurentide ice sheet retreated and advanced with climatic variations and these changes in ice cover contributed to isostatic adjustments in the level of the land over which the watercourses ran. These changes in turn uncovered or blocked the lake\\'s other outlets to the sea.\\n\\nSection::::Course.\\nWhile active this turbulent stream cut and eroded a bed up to wide and deep. This has left a valley which starts at Traverse Gap near Browns Valley, Minnesota, goes southeast to Mankato, then turns northeast to the Twin Cities. River Warren was joined by the comparatively small Mississippi at Fort Snelling, from which the valley continues northeast to present-day Saint Paul, where the massive River Warren Falls once graced the landscape. Over 1700 years this waterfall retreated upstream and undercut the Mississippi at the site of Fort Snelling. The falls then split. The Mississippi falls migrated upstream to form Saint Anthony Falls and create Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis. The River Warren falls receded west in the Minnesota River valley until they reached an older buried river valley about west of the confluence, where the falls were extinguished.\\n\\nFrom Saint Paul the great valley goes southeast to Prescott, Wisconsin, where it is joined by the St. Croix River, itself once the outlet of another proglacial lake, Glacial Lake Duluth which occupied the western part of Lake Superior. From its confluence with the St. Croix the valley continues southeast along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border. River Warren\\'s effects include the creation of bluffs along the valleys of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, and contributed to the formation of Lake Pepin.\\n\\nSection::::Disappearance.\\nBy about 9400 BP, the ice sheet finally retreated sufficiently far to the north that Lake Agassiz permanently took another outlet and receded below the level of Traverse Gap. River Warren then ceased to run. The Lake Agassiz area watershed now feeds the Red River of the North which flows north, ultimately to Hudson Bay. River Warren\\'s upper valley in the Traverse Gap is now occupied by the tiny Little Minnesota River, which flows into Big Stone Lake and the Minnesota River, which follows the greater river\\'s ancient bed to its confluence with the Mississippi River.

It was an expression of Manifest Destiny but it never went into effect. The United States only took the underpopulated districts in the far North of Mexico via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico, following the Mexican–American War of 1846-48.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nBefore James Polk took office in 1845, the United States Congress approved the annexation of Texas. Polk wished to gain control of a portion of Texas, which had declared independence from Mexico in 1836, but was still being claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the Mexican–American War on April 24, 1846. With American success on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of \"All Mexico\", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.\\n\\nSection::::Controversies.\\nThe proposal to annex all of Mexico was controversial. Idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like John L. O\\'Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of \"All Mexico\" would be a violation of this principle. The annexation of all Mexico also found controversy in extending U.S.\\xa0citizenship to millions of Mexicans.\\n\\nThis debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of manifest destiny: on the one hand, while identitarian ideas inherent in manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans, as non-whites, would present a threat to white racial integrity and thus were not qualified to become U.S. citizens, the \"mission\" component of manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or \"regenerated\", as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the \"All Mexico\" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny. Conversely, proponents of annexation of \"All Mexico\" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure. Many U.S. nationals were troubled by the Catholicism of Mexico, the weakness of Republicanism there, and the threat of an upsurge of Mexican nationalism.\\n\\nSection::::End of the Call.\\nThe controversy was eventually ended by the Mexican Cession, which added the territories of Alta California and Nuevo México to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All Oregon movement, the All Mexico movement quickly abated. \\n\\nHistorian Frederick Merk, in \"Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation\" (1963), argued that the failure of the All Oregon and All Mexico movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive \"continentalism\" was an aberration supported by only a minority of Americans, mostly Democrats, while it was opposed by Whigs and some Democrats. Thus the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico, while those in Mississippi supported it.\\n\\n', 'title': 'All of Mexico Movement', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1104346'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11044950', 'text': 'Beit Hanan\\n\\nBeit Hanan () is a moshav in central Israel.

Formed in 1993 in the Cleveland Warehouse District, the band is known for their avant-garde sound which includes influence from heavy metal, art rock and electro-industrial and their imagery which features masks and costumes as well as their unique live shows usually performed at smaller venues. Mushroomhead has sold over 2 million units worldwide, and has made 7 studio albums and 15 music videos. Over their lifetime, Mushroomhead has gone through many changes in band lineups, with drummer Steve Felton being the only consistent member.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::\"Mushroomhead\", \"Superbuick\" and \"M3\" (1993–2000).\\nIn 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members\\' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group\\'s sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, masks, and pseudonyms. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band GWAR. \"We played our first show on a Saturday\" said the band\\'s drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead\\'s official website. “Three days later, we got a call to play with GWAR at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people – our second show ever!”.\\n\\nIn 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, \"Mushroomhead\", with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released \"Superbuick\". In 1999, Mushroomhead released \"M3\", which was the final album self-financed and self-released by the band.\\n\\nSection::::\"XX\" and \"XIII\" (2000–2005).\\nIn 2001, Mushroomhead released a compilation album titled \"XX\" on the independent label Eclipse Records. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2–3 months, the band signed with major label Universal Records and the compilation was remastered and re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including Ozzfest 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video \"Solitaire/Unraveling\". Also in 2001, guitarist J.J. Righteous was replaced by one of the band\\'s previous stage dancers & then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of \"XIII\", their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single \"Sun Doesn\\'t Rise\" which was featured on \"MTV: Headbangers Ball\" and the \"Freddy vs Jason\" soundtrack. Also featuring the hidden track \"Crazy\", a song originally by Seal. The album debuted at no. 40 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200 charts and sold 400,000 copies worldwide.\\n\\nAfter an extensive world tour, vocalist J Mann announced he was leaving the band in August 2004, citing exhaustion and to take care of his sick father. He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, Waylon. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first DVD on its own Filthy Hands label – \"Volume 1\". Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band\\'s rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage.\\n\\nWhile on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with Megaforce Records, ensuring the new album\\'s availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat – an interactive flash feature as a part of the band\\'s official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a Mortal Kombat-style environment, with each member having a unique fatality.\\n\\nMushroomhead headlined with Dope, Nocturne, and New Orleans locals Invain on the Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by Jägermeister at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Louisiana on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to Hurricane Katrina striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005.\\n\\nSection::::\"Savior Sorrow\" and \"Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children\" (2005–2012).\\n\"Savior Sorrow\" was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No.\\xa045 on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts with sales exceeding 12,000. The band\\'s label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour. As a result, SoundScan issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates. The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the Best Buy retailer chain. Sales of Savior Sorrow were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No.\\xa030 spot than No.\\xa073. Savior Sorrow\\'s chart position was later officially adjusted to No.\\xa050. \"Simple Survival\", the pre-released single to Savior Sorrow, was placed at No.\\xa039 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart one week after the release. Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil\\' Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer.\\n\\nThe band has performed three shows on the Mayhem Festival tour, filling in for Bullet for My Valentine. Live footage was compiled into the band\\'s second DVD, titled \"Volume 2\". On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger\\'s Ball for \"12 Hundred\" from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the \"Volume 2\" DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including \"12 Hundred\", \"Simple Survival\", \"Burn\", the short video for \"Tattoo\", \"Save Us\" and \"Embrace the Ending\", video commentary and behind the scenes footage. To support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with The Autumn Offering, XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album.\\n\\nThey released \"Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children\" in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No.\\xa01 best selling metal album on iTunes. A new song, \"Your Soul Is Mine,\" appeared on the \"Saw VI Soundtrack\". On October 1, 2010, a music video for \"Come On\" debuted on \"Headbangers Ball\" on MTV. The video has since been barred from airing on MTV and other television outlets after being deemed too graphic by network censors. On October 28, 2010, the band\\'s founding guitarist, JJ Righteous, died of unknown reasons at the age of 41.\\n\\nIn October 2010, following the death of ex bandmate JJ Righteous, J Mann appeared on stage with the band during their Halloween show, performing vocals for two songs alongside both Jeffrey Nothing and Waylon. Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) (Now called \"Impact Wrestling\") used their hit single \"Come On\" as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.\\n\\nIn February 2012, it was announced that guitarist Gravy and bassist Pig Benis would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave \"Gravy\" Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was \"kicked out of the band.\" In May 2012, Daniel \"Lil Dan\" Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from Hed PE) had taken over Fox\\'s percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox\\'s drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him \"Tall E\" in reference to Fox\\'s nickname being \"Lil Dan\". On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 \"Old School Show\".\\n\\nSection::::\"The Righteous & the Butterfly\", return of J Mann and departure of Waylon Reavis and Jeffrey Nothing (2012–present).\\nIn September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeff Hatrix that former Slipknot and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.\\n\\nTheir eighth album was the only one to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Steve Felton described it as \"very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it\\'s going to go. For the old school fans there\\'s a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it.\"\\n\\nOn August 16, Jason Popson confirmed his return to the band via Facebook. Mushroomhead toured Australia for the first time as part of the Soundwave Festival 2014. On February 14, 2014, Mushroomhead released the date and name of their new album which will be released May 13, 2014 and the name of the new album is \"The Righteous & the Butterfly\". This album marks the return of J Mann. On April 15, 2014, Frontman Jeffrey Nothing released the band\\'s first unofficial single \"Qwerty\" on YouTube from his personal Facebook account. This marks the first song featuring J Mann since rejoining the band. The album received mostly positive reviews and is Mushroomhead\\'s first album to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Top 200 chart in the United States, reaching #20, selling around 11,000 copies the first week. The album also, reached #1 in the \"Billboard\" Indie chart, their first album to do so. \"The Righteous & the Butterfly\" reached #5 in the Top Rock Albums and #1 in the Top Hard Rock Albums. Mushroomhead have released an official music video for the album\\'s second single \"Out Of My Mind\". The band will be co-headlining the 2014 Shockfest Tour with Insane Clown Posse.\\n\\nAs of October 5, 2015, vocalist Waylon Reavis announced via his Facebook page that he had parted ways with Mushroomhead, citing \"irreconcilable differences with band ownership\" and stating he had \"severed all ties with Mushroomhead and Filthy Hands Company.\"\\n\\nMushroomhead went on a headlining UK tour in 2016, the first since 2002. American Head Charge was supposed to be their main support, but they ultimately decided to drop off the tour. A full European tour followed the next year.\\n\\nOn March 7, 2018, it was announced that vocalist and founding member Jeffrey \"Nothing\" Hatrix had parted ways with the band. Two days later, guitarist Tommy Church announced that he had also quit the band. On March 17, vocalist Steve Rauckhorst and guitarist Tommy \"Tankx\" Shaffner were revealed as the new members of the band.\\n\\nOn April 4, 2019, Mushroomhead announced that they had signed with Napalm Records.\\n\\nSection::::Musical style and influences.\\nMushroomhead\\'s sound combines elements of heavy metal, hip hop, experimental music, industrial music and techno. The band has been categorized as industrial metal, alternative metal, nu metal, experimental metal and electro-industrial.\\n\\nThey are influenced by bands such as Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Pink Floyd, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails, and KMFDM. In a 2014 interview with music journalist Greg Prato, Jason Popson reflected on the band\\'s musical influences, stating \"When you\\'re talking about a band with nine guys, you\\'re talking about tons of influences. I know when we started the band, we were really into a lot of the stuff Mike Patton was doing - Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, things like that. But we also liked heavier bands like Meshuggah, Pantera. Then there\\'s electronic stuff. So it\\'s really all over the map. It\\'s everything from hard rock to punk rock to hip-hop to electronica. It\\'s pretty vast.\"\\n\\nSection::::Image and relationship with Slipknot.\\nThe members of Mushroomhead have identified themselves by wearing masks and by its distinct “X Face” logo – commonly worn on the masks of most members, as well as clothing and merchandise. The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band\\'s look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours.\\nIn January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in Season 4 of original SyFy series \"Face Off\", a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition.\\nSince 1999, Mushroomhead has had an on-and-off rivalry with Iowa-based metal band Slipknot. The feud erupted (mostly among fans) due to the image similarities between the bands; such as the masks and costumes worn on stage. Before signing Slipknot, Roadrunner Records was interested in signing Mushroomhead, but Mushroomhead passed on the deal. As of 2009, the rivalry is now officially over as confirmed in several interviews with Waylon, ST1TCH and Skinny. Following the death of Slipknot member Paul Gray in 2010, Mushroomhead posted on their official Myspace page: \"R.I.P. Paul Gray, This feud needs to end. Much Love and Respect to the guys in Slipknot\".\\n\\nIn 2012, Slipknot singer Corey Taylor has stated that he never had a problem with the band, he only had a problem with the behavior of their fans due to a situation Slipknot faced when they played in Mushroomhead\\'s home town in Cleveland, OH and said there was never a real feud between bands but the feud was between Mushroomhead fans and Slipknot fans. He stated that doing a tour with Mushroomhead, Gwar, and Mudvayne “would be beautiful!”. The same year, Mushroomhead members joined Slipknot\\'s Sid Wilson on stage in an impromptu performance during Wilson\\'s DJ set.\\n\\nIn 2014, singer Jeffrey \"Nothing\" Hatrix stated about the feud between the two bands: \"Fans are very loyal to the bands they like. Members of both sides have said they are over it and that it was never really between the bands. Let’s all move on\".\\n\\nSection::::Band members.\\nCurrent members\\n\\nTouring members\\nFormer members\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Mushroomhead', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105480'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11054827', 'text': 'Licario\\n\\nLicario, called Ikarios () by the Greek chroniclers, was a Byzantine admiral of Italian origin in the 13th century. At odds with the Latin barons (the \"triarchs\") of his native Euboea, he entered the service of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), and reconquered many of the Aegean islands for him in the 1270s. For his exploits, he was rewarded with Euboea as a fief and rose to the rank of \"megas konostaulos\" and \"megas doux\", the first foreigner to do so.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nSection::::Origins and early life.\\nLicario was born in Karystos in Latin-held Euboea (Negroponte), from a Vicentian father and a local woman. He was of humble origin, but able and ambitious. Serving as a knight under the Latin triarch Giberto II da Verona, he managed to win the heart of Felisa, sister of Giberto and widow of another triarch, Narzotto dalle Carceri. The match was met with disapproval by Felisa\\'s family. They secretly married, but the marriage was cancelled by her relatives. Fleeing from their wrath, Licario sought refuge in the fort of Anemopylae near Cavo D\\'Oro. He repaired the strong fortress, assembled a small group of followers, and began raiding the surrounding estates, belonging to the island\\'s nobles.\\n\\nSection::::Entry into Byzantine service.\\nAt that time, the newly restored Byzantine Empire, under the leadership of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin insular possession in the Aegean Sea, and the main naval base, not only of the Venetian fleet, but also of Latin piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/70, in retaliation for raids against the coasts of Asia Minor, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles near the town of Oreos.\\n\\nFacing the persistent refusal of the island\\'s barons to treat with him, desiring vengeance and eager for glory and wealth, Licario presented himself to Philanthropenos, offering his services. He, in turn, took him to the Emperor, who was eager to use the services of talented Westerners whenever he could, and had already bankrolled several Latin corsairs in his service. Licario became the Emperor\\'s vassal according to Western feudal rules, and in turn was strengthened with imperial troops. Under the leadership of Licario, the Byzantines could now mount a serious attempt to conquer the island, while their forces were further augmented by many defections from the Greek population.\\n\\nIn 1272/73, the Byzantine forces, now under Licario\\'s command, launched a campaign that took the fortresses of Larmena, La Cuppa, Clisura and Manducho. The Lombard triarchs then appealed to their liege-lord, Prince William II of Achaea, and to Dreux de Beaumont, marshal of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily. William was able to recover La Cuppa, but de Beaumont was defeated in a pitched battle and was subsequently recalled by Charles of Anjou. Between then and 1275, according to the Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo, Licario himself served in the Byzantine army in Asia Minor, where he scored a victory against the Turks.\\n\\nSection::::Conquest of Euboea and campaigns in the Aegean.\\nIn 1276, following their great victory over the Lombard triarchs of Negroponte at the Battle of Demetrias, the Byzantines renewed their offensive in Euboea. Licario attacked his native Karystos, seat of the southern triarchy, and took it, after a long siege, in the same year. For this success, he was rewarded by Michael VIII with the whole island as a fief, and a noble Greek wife with a rich dowry. In turn, Licario pledged to provide 200 knights to the Emperor. Gradually, Licario reduced the Latin strongholds on the island, until, by 1278, he had seized almost all of it except for the capital, the city of Negroponte (Chalkis).\\n\\nFor his successes, Licario was rewarded with the post of \"megas konostaulos\", head of the Latin mercenaries, and eventually appointed as \"megas doux\" after Philanthropenos\\'s death in ; the first foreigner to be thus honoured. He commanded the Byzantine navy in a series of expeditions against the Latin-held Aegean islands. The first to fall was Skopelos, whose fortress was believed to be impregnable. Licario, however, knew that it lacked water supplies. Thus, he attacked it during the hot and dry summer of 1277 and forced its surrender. Its lord, Filippo Ghisi, was captured and sent to Constantinople; his other possessions, the islands of Skyros, Skiathos and Amorgos, were also taken soon after. After that, Licario went on to capture the islands of Kythera and Antikythera off the southern coast of the Morea, and later Kea, Astypalaia, and Santorini in the Cyclades. The great island of Lemnos was also captured, although its lord, Paolo Navigajoso, withstood a three-year siege before surrendering.\\n\\nFinally, in late 1279 or early 1280, he returned to Euboea, landing in the norther town of Oreos and moving south towards Negroponte. His forces by now included many Spanish and Catalan mercenaries (the first time the latter are mentioned in Greece) and even former adherents of Manfred of Sicily, who had fled to Greece after Manfred\\'s defeat and death at the hands of Charles of Anjou. As he reached Negroponte, the triarch Giberto II da Verona, Felisa\\'s brother, and John I de la Roche, the Duke of Athens, who were present at the city, rode out with their forces to meet him. The two armies met at the village of Vatondas, northeast of Negroponte. The battle resulted in a major victory for Licario: John de la Roche was unhorsed and captured, while Giberto was either killed (according to Sanudo) or captured and taken along with de la Roche as a prisoner to Constantinople, where, according to Nikephoros Gregoras, the sight of the hated renegade, moving triumphantly among the assembled Byzantine court, caused him to drop dead.\\n\\nAfter Vatondas, Negroponte seemed about to fall into Licario\\'s hands too. The city, however, was quickly reinforced by Jacques de la Roche, lord of Argos and Nauplia, who, along with the energetic Venetian \"bailo\" of Negroponte, Niccolo Morosini Rosso, led its defence. Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario then turned to reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except for the city of Negroponte itself, and ruling it from the fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were taken, and Licario\\'s ships raided the Morea.\\n\\nLicario himself sailed to Constantinople, presenting Emperor Michael VIII with his captives. Then, at the height of his fame and success in , Licario disappears from the sources, and his subsequent fate is unknown. Most likely he lived in Constantinople and died there.\\n\\nSection::::Assessment.\\nHis conquests proved temporary only, as the Byzantines were gradually evicted by the Venetians and the other Latin lords. Even in Euboea, Licario\\'s major gain and personal fief, the triarchs managed to complete their reconquest of the entire island by 1296. Nevertheless, Licario proved one of the most successful military leaders in Michael VIII\\'s employ, and his victories greatly enhanced the emperor\\'s own standing and prestige amongst the Latins. The historian Deno John Geanakoplos ranks him, along with Michael\\'s brother John Palaiologos, as the two men who caused the most damage to the Latin rulers of Greece.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Licario', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11054827'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '110563', 'text': 'Puhi, Hawaii\\n\\nPuhi (literally, \"blow\" in Hawaiian) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States.

Although it was not the only such mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. The mission was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck, based to some degree on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I.\\n\\nThe aim of the mission was threefold; to gain recognition for the newly reinstated imperial dynasty under the Emperor Meiji; to begin preliminary renegotiation of the unequal treaties with the dominant world powers; and to make a comprehensive study of modern industrial, political, military and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe.\\n\\nThe Iwakura mission followed several such missions previously sent by the Shogunate, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860, the First Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1862, and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1863.\\n\\nSection::::Participants.\\nThe mission was named after and headed by Iwakura Tomomi in the role of extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, assisted by four vice-ambassadors, three of whom (Ōkubo Toshimichi, Kido Takayoshi, and Itō Hirobumi) were also ministers in the Japanese government. The historian Kume Kunitake as private secretary to Iwakura Tomomi, was the official diarist of the journey. The log of the expedition published in 1878 in five volumes as \"Tokumei Zenken Taishi Bei-O Kairan Jikki\" (特命全権大使米欧回覧実記), provided a detailed account of Japanese observations on the United States and rapidly industrializing Western Europe.\\n\\nAlso included in the mission were a number of administrators and scholars, totaling 48 people.

Several of the students were left behind to complete their education in the foreign countries, including five young women who stayed in the United States to study, including the then 6-year old Tsuda Umeko, who after returning to Japan, founded the Joshi Eigaku Juku (present day Tsuda University) in 1900, Nagai Shigeko, later Baroness Uryū Shigeko, as well as Yamakawa Sutematsu, later Princess Ōyama Sutematsu.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Itinerary.\\nSection::::United States.\\nOn 23 December 1871 the mission sailed from Yokohama on the , bound for San Francisco. Arriving in San Francisco on 15 January 1872, the group travelled by train via Salt Lake City and Chicago eventually reaching Washington, D.C. on 29 February. The mission\\'s stay in the United States was extended with an attempt to negotiate new treaty rights, a task that necessitated two members of the party to return to Japan to obtain necessary letters of representation. Members of the Iwakura Mission were keenly interested in observing schools and learning more about educational policy. Tours to schools, universities and industrial locations in Boston, New York and Washington DC were made as a result.\\n\\nUnsuccessful in their attempts to renegotiate the existing unequal treaties the party eventually set sail for the United Kingdom in August 1872.\\n\\nSection::::United Kingdom.\\nOn 17 August 1872 the Iwakura Mission arrived at Liverpool on the Cunard steamer Olympus. Traveling to London via Manchester the party spent much of late August and early September in and around the capital inspecting political, academic and military institutions, visiting the British Museum, travelling on the newly constructed London Underground and attending musical concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. After visits to the Royal dockyards at Portsmouth and a day visit to Brighton, the mission split into smaller groups to visit, among other places, Blair Atholl in the Highlands of Scotland, Edinburgh, the Yorkshire Dales and the industrial centers of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne and Bradford.\\n\\nIwakura Tomomi led the Manchester-Liverpool delegation. A visit that culminated on 7 October in a civic reception and banquet where toasts highlighted the leading role of the region in world manufacturing, technology and municipal administration. In Glasgow, as guests of Lord Blantyre, the delegation stayed at Erskine House and given tours of shipbuilding and steel fabrication facilities on banks of the River Clyde.\\n\\nIn Newcastle upon Tyne the group arrived on 21 October staying in the Royal Station Hotel where they met the industrialist Sir William Armstrong. It had been ten years since the Bakufu mission had visited the town, but as a direct result of the visit significant new export orders were obtained for ships and armaments from Tyneside factories.\\n\\nThey visited the Elswick Engine and Ordnance Works with Captain Andrew Noble and George Rendell, inspected the hydraulic engines and the boring and turning departments and examined the construction of Armstrong and Gatling guns. They also visited the Gosforth Colliery, descending into the mine itself. Further visits were made to Bolkcow and Vaughan Iron Works in Middlesbrough and iron-ore mines in Cleveland. The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce arranged a river trip on the Tyne, taking in the High Level Bridge, the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company Hebburn and the Jarrow Chemical Works.\\n\\nFrom Newcastle upon Tyne the group travelled to Yorkshire, visiting the open countryside and Bolton Abbey prior to inspecting textile manufacturing facilities at Salts Mill in Saltaire and Dean Clough Mill in Halifax. Accompanied by the British Envoy to Japan, Sir Harry Smith Parkes, the group toured not only manufacturing facilities but also village accommodation, schools, almshouses, hospitals and parks provided by Sir Titus Salt and Sir John Crossley for their workers.\\n\\nA visit to Chatsworth House on 30 October was followed by visits to Burton-upon-Trent, Birmingham, Worcester, Stoke on Trent and Chester.\\n\\nThe delegation was presented at an official audience with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 5 December 1872. Another audience with the Prince of Wales took place at Sandringham on 9 December. The party finally left for France on 16 December.\\n\\nSection::::France, Germany and the return to Japan.\\nFrance, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia, Germany, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Bavaria, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland were all visited by the mission during the first half of 1873. On the return journey, Egypt, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and Shanghai were also stopping points en route, although visits in these locations were much shorter. The mission eventually reached Yokohama on 13 September 1873, almost two years after first setting out.\\n\\nSection::::Purpose and results.\\nOf the initial goals of the mission the aim of revision of the unequal treaties was not achieved, prolonging the mission by almost four months, but also impressing the importance of the second goal on its members. The attempts to negotiate new treaties under better conditions with the foreign governments led to criticism of the mission that members were attempting to go beyond the mandate set by the Japanese government. Members of the mission were nonetheless favorably impressed by industrial modernization seen in America and Europe and the experience of the tour provided them a strong impetus to lead similar modernization initiatives on their return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Iwakura Mission', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105944'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11059950', 'text': 'List of CDMA terminology\\n\\nThis page contains terminology related to CDMA International Roaming.

Until 1918, it was also associated with the princely titles of members of some German ruling and mediatised dynasties and with a few princely but non-ruling families. It was also the form of address used for cadet members of the dynasties of France, Italy, Russia and Ernestine Saxony, under their monarchies. Additionally, the treatment was granted for some, but not all, princely yet non-reigning families of Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania and Russia by emperors or popes. In a handful of rare cases, it was employed by non-royal rulers in viceregal or even republican contexts.\\n\\nIn a number of older English dictionaries, \"serene\" as used in this context means \"supreme\"; \"royal\"; \"august\"; \"marked by majestic dignity or grandeur\"; or \"high or supremely dignified\".\\n\\nSection::::German-speaking lands.\\nThe current, legal usage of the style in the German-speaking countries is confined to the Princely Family of Liechtenstein, the entirety of which bears the treatment.\\n\\nThe German term is \"Durchlaucht\", a translation of the Latin \"(su)perillustris\". This is usually translated into English as \"Serene Highness\", however, it would be more literal to translate it as \"superior to, above, beyond or greater than illustrious\", as it is an augmentation of \"Erlaucht\" (\"illustrious\"), which was accorded to immediate counts (\"Reichsgrafen\") of the Holy Roman Empire and by mediatised counts of the German Confederation and the German Empire. The 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica wryly observes that a perfectly logical English version might be \"Your Serenity\".\\n\\nIn 1375 Emperor Charles IV bestowed the nobiliary style \"Durchlauchtig\" (Most Serene Highness) upon the seven Prince-electors designated by the Golden Bull of 1356. As from 1664 Emperor Leopold I vested all Imperial Princes with the title, it became so common that the Electors like the Archdukes of Austria began to use the superlative address \"Durchlauchtigst\". In the German Empire, the style of \"Serene Highness\" was usually held by princes of lower rank than those who were entitled to \"Highness\" (exceptions were the Wettin cadets of the Ernestine duchies), \"Grand Ducal Highness\", \"Royal Highness\", and \"Imperial Highness\". Therefore, if a woman entitled to the treatment of \"Royal Highness\" married a man who was addressed only as \"Serene Highness\", the woman usually retained her pre-marital style.\\n\\nIn 1905 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria granted the style of \"Durchlaucht\" to members of virtually every family which had held the title of prince in the former Holy Roman Empire, even if the family had never exercised sovereignty.\\n\\nIn the German and Austrian empires of the 19th and 20th centuries, the style \"Serene Highness\" was also officially borne by:\\n\\nBy tradition, \"Durchlaucht\" is still attributed to the princely dynasties which were sovereign until 1917 or had been mediatised under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and German Confederation in 1815, although the usage has been unofficial since 1918.\\n\\nN.B. The highest form of \"durchlauchtig\" (adjective) was allerdurchlauchtigst (absolutely most serene), which was reserved only to the Emperor in his style of adress: \"Allerdurchlauchtigster Großmächtigster Allergnädigster Kaiser und Herr\"\\n\\nSection::::Francophone dominions.\\nThere is some evidence that in pre-Revolutionary France, unlike Germany, one entitled to be addressed as \"Serene Highness\" was considered to outrank someone who was merely addressed as \"Highness\". Those members of the royal family who were not children or grandchildren of a king, i.e., the \"princes du sang\", were entitled to be addressed as \"Most Serene Highness\" (\"son altesse sérénissime\"). The simple style of \"Highness\" (\"altesse\") was claimed by the \"princes étrangers\" and the \"princes légitimés\". In fact, these formal styles were seldom employed in conversation, since the \"princes du sang\" used unique styles (e.g. \"Mademoiselle\", \"Monsieur le Prince\"), while the ducal peers, led by the proud Duc de Saint-Simon, avoided conceding the \"altesse\" to the \"princes étrangers\" and \"bâtards royals\", prompting nobles of lesser rank to do likewise.\\n\\nThe reigning Prince of Monaco, Albert II, is addressed as \"His Serene Highness\". His wife, children and younger sister, Princess Stéphanie, are also referred to as \"Serene Highness\". His elder sister, Princess Caroline, was also styled \"Her Serene Highness\" prior to her 1999 marriage, but is styled \"Royal Highness\" since then, even during the period when she was officially \"The Hereditary Princess of Monaco\" as heiress presumptive to the throne. In French, both male and female versions are \"Son Altesse Sérénissime\" (\"S.A.S.\"), which translates, literally, as \"His/Her \"Most\" Serene Highness\".\\n\\nSection::::Italy.\\nIn the Republic of Venice, also called \"the Serene Republic\", the Doge was known as \"Serenissimus\" (\"Most Serene\") as was the Duke of Mantua.\\n\\nChildren of the Savoy kings and crown princes of Italy were entitled to the treatment of \"Royal Highness\", but more remote male-line descendants were \"Serene Highnesses\" by right (although often the style of \"Royal Highness\" was granted to them \"ad personam\", e.g., the Dukes of Aosta or the Dukes of Genoa).\\n\\nThe mediatised House of Thurn and Taxis, entitled to the \"Serene Highness\" treatment in the German Empire, has a non-dynastic cadet branch, the Dukes di Castel Duino, which obtained naturalization in Italy in 1923. When incorporated into the Italian nobility, their use of the \"Serene Highness\" style was authorised by the Crown.\\n\\nSection::::San Marino.\\nSan Marino is styled as the Most Serene Republic.\\n\\nSection::::Poland.\\nIn the First Republic of Poland (1569-1795), also called \"the Most Serene Republic of Poland\" (\"Najjaśniejsza Rzeczpospolita Polska\"), His/Her \"Serene Reigning Majesty\" (SRM) was a style used by the reigning monarchs.\\n\\nSection::::Russia.\\nAfter 1886, great-grandchildren of Russian emperors in the male-line, and their descendants, were princes or princesses, and accorded the treatment of \"Serene Highness\". The exception was the senior male by primogeniture in the patrilineal descent of each great-grandson, who retained the higher style of \"Highness\". \\n\\nStrictly, the Russian term, \"Svetlost\", was an honorific used in adjectival form (\"Светлейший\": \"Svetleyshiy\") to refer to members of a select few of Russia\\'s princely families (e.g. \"The Serene\" Prince Anatoly Pavlovich Lieven or \"The Serene\" Prince Dmitri Vladimirovich Golitsyn). However, when translated into non-Slavic languages and used in reference to a member of the imperial Romanov family, it was usually rendered as \"Serene Highness\".\\n\\nSection::::United Kingdom.\\nQueen Victoria elevated each of the princes who married her daughters to \"Royal Highness\" (except for Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia, husband of Victoria, Princess Royal, who already possessed the HRH). This included, on 30 January 1884, HSH Prince Henry of Battenberg, husband of Princess Beatrice. That couple\\'s children were granted the style of \"Highness\" by their British grandmother by letters patent 4 December 1886.\\n\\nSeveral morganatic branches of reigning German dynasties took up residence in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, where their German princely titles and style of \"Serene Highness\" were recognized by the sovereign. Included in this group were Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the dukes and princes of Teck and the princes of Battenberg.\\n\\nDuring World War I, King George V revoked recognition of the style \"Serene Highness\", hitherto used by some relatives of the British Royal Family who used German princely titles but lived in Britain. George V\\'s queen consort was born \"\"Her Serene Highness\" Princess Mary of Teck\", and Prince Philip\\'s mother had been born \"\"Her Serene Highness\" Princess Alice of Battenberg\". The Tecks (descended from the royal house of Württemberg) and the Battenbergs (descended from the Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine) were compensated with multiple peerages, \"viz.\" Marquess of Cambridge and Earl of Athlone for the former, and Marquess of Milford Haven and Marquess of Carisbrooke for the latter.\\n\\nSection::::Belgium.\\nThe following titleholders or families are authorised by the Crown to use the style \"Serene Highness\": \\n\\n\\nSection::::Hungary.\\nBefore 1947, the style \"His/Her Serene Highness\" (Őfőméltósága, literally: \"His/Her High Dignity\") was in use in Hungary. Peers with the title of prince were entitled to it, and between 1920 and 1944 the regent, Miklós Horthy, was styled as His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary \"(Őfőméltósága, a Magyar Királyság kormányzója)\".\\n\\nSection::::Portugal.\\nAs the most powerful noble family in Portugal, the Dukes of Braganza had the official treatment of \"Serene Highness\" until 1640, when they mounted the Portuguese throne, thereby becoming entitled to the style of \"Royal Highness\", however the infantes not in direct line for the throne of Portugal were titled as \"His/Her Highness, the Serene Infante(a)\".\\n\\nSection::::Mexico.\\nFrom 1853 to 1855 the president of Mexico, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, enjoyed the official style of \"Most Serene Highness\", a treatment unique in that country.\\n\\nAgustin I de Mexico gave that title to several members of his family.\\n\\nSection::::Spain.\\nIn 1807 Manuel de Godoy, Prince de la Paz, was accorded the style of \"Most Serene Highness\", a treatment unique in that country at the time. Previous to this grant the style was sometimes used by the Catholic Monarch Isabella and Ferdinand as well as by other houses known anciently as illustrious or serene. A majority of these ancient houses lost the style through prescription. \\n\\nThe honorific () is one of the styles of the \"infantes\". \\nSection::::Thailand.\\nIn Thailand, the title of Serene Highness is the westernized style of the Thai title of Mom Chao (\"His/Her Serene Highness Prince/Princess\" | Thai: หม่อมเจ้า), denoting the grandchild of a king through one of his princely sons. In present-day Thailand, there are very few Mom Chao left after the royal family discontinued the traditional practice of polygamous marriages, and in Thailand all royal titles and styles decrease one level every generation for those not of the immediate royal family. Therefore, the child of a Mom Chao would only have the aristocratic title of Mom Rajawongse, which would then decrease in the next generation to Mom Luang, which would then decrease further, similar to a British life peerage.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Serene Highness', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106074'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1106101', 'text': 'Radiation hormesis\\n\\nRadiation hormesis is the hypothesis that low doses of ionizing radiation (within the region of and just above natural background levels) are beneficial, stimulating the activation of repair mechanisms that protect against disease, that are not activated in absence of ionizing radiation (similar to vaccinations). The reserve repair mechanisms are hypothesized to be sufficiently effective when stimulated as to not only cancel the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation but also inhibit disease not related to radiation exposure (see hormesis). This hypothesis has captured the attention of scientists and public alike in recent years.\\n\\nWhile the effects of high and acute doses of ionising radiation are easily observed and understood in humans (\"e.g.\" Japanese atomic bomb survivors), the effects of low-level radiation are very difficult to observe and highly controversial. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high and the risk of developing cancer fluctuates 40% because of individual life style and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low-level radiation. An acute effective dose of 100 millisieverts may increase cancer risk by ~0.8%. However, children are particularly sensitive to radioactivity, with childhood leukemias and other cancers increasing even within natural and man-made background radiation levels (under 4\\xa0mSv cumulative with 1\\xa0mSv being an average annual dose from terrestrial and cosmic radiation excluding radon which primarily doses the lung). There is also indication that exposures around this dose level will cause negative subclinical health impacts to neural development. Students born in regions of Sweden with higher Chernobyl fallout performed worse in secondary school, particularly in mathematics. “Damage is accentuated within families (i.e., siblings comparison) and among children born to parents with low education...\" who often don\\'t have the resources to overcome this additional health challenge.\\n\\nHormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Government and regulatory bodies disagree on the existence of radiation hormesis and research points to the \"severe problems and limitations\" with the use of hormesis in general as the \"principal dose-response default assumption in a risk assessment process charged with\\nensuring public health protection.\"\\n\\nQuoting results from a literature database research, the Académie des Sciences – Académie nationale de Médecine (French Academy of Sciences – National Academy of Medicine) stated in their 2005 report concerning the effects of low-level radiation that many laboratory studies have observed radiation hormesis. However, they cautioned that it is not yet known if radiation hormesis occurs outside the laboratory, or in humans.\\n\\nReports by the United States National Research Council and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) argue that there is no evidence for hormesis in humans and in the case of the National Research Council hormesis is outright rejected as a possibility. Therefore, estimating Linear no-threshold model (LNT) continues to be the model generally used by regulatory agencies for human radiation exposure.\\n\\nSection::::Proposed mechanism and ongoing debate.\\nRadiation hormesis proposes that radiation exposure comparable to and just above the natural background level of radiation is not harmful but beneficial, while accepting that much higher levels of radiation are hazardous. Proponents of radiation hormesis typically claim that radio-protective responses in cells and the immune system not only counter the harmful effects of radiation but additionally act to inhibit spontaneous cancer not related to radiation exposure. Radiation hormesis stands in stark contrast to the more generally accepted linear no-threshold model (LNT), which states that the radiation dose-risk relationship is linear across all doses, so that small doses are still damaging, albeit less so than higher ones. Opinion pieces on chemical and radiobiological hormesis appeared in the journals Nature and Science in 2003.\\n\\nAssessing the risk of radiation at low doses (<100 mSv) and low dose rates (<0.1 mSv.min) is highly problematic and controversial. While epidemiological studies on populations of people exposed to an acute dose of high level radiation such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors () have robustly upheld the LNT (mean dose ~210 mSv), studies involving low doses and low dose rates have failed to detect any increased cancer rate. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high (~42 of 100 people will be diagnosed in their lifetime) and it fluctuates ~40% because of lifestyle and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low level radiation. Epidemiological studies may be capable of detecting elevated cancer rates as low as 1.2 to 1.3 \"i.e.\" 20% to 30% increase. But for low doses (1–100 mSv) the predicted elevated risks are only 1.001 to 1.04 and excess cancer cases, if present, cannot be detected due to confounding factors, errors and biases. \\n\\nIn particular, variations in smoking prevalence or even accuracy in reporting smoking cause wide variation in excess cancer and measurement error bias. Thus, even a large study of many thousands of subjects with imperfect smoking prevalence information will fail to detect the effects of low level radiation than a smaller study that properly compensates for smoking prevalence. Given the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, there is considerable debate as to whether the dose-response relationship <100 mSv is supralinear, linear (LNT), has a threshold, is \"sub-linear\", or whether the coefficient is negative with a sign change, i.e. a hormetic response.\\n\\nThe radiation adaptive response seems to be a main origin of the potential hormetic effect. The theoretical studies indicate that the adaptive response is responsible for the shape of dose-response curve and can transform the linear relationship (LNT) into the hormetic one. \\n\\nWhile most major consensus reports and government bodies currently adhere to LNT, the 2005 French Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Medicine\\'s report concerning the effects of low-level radiation rejected LNT as a scientific model of carcinogenic risk at low doses.\\n\\nUsing LNT to estimate the carcinogenic effect at doses of less than 20 mSv is not justified in the light of current radiobiologic knowledge.\\n\\nThey consider there to be several dose-effect relationships rather than only one, and that these relationships have many variables such as target tissue, radiation dose, dose rate and individual sensitivity factors. They request that further study is required on low doses (less than 100 mSv) and very low doses (less than 10 mSv) as well as the impact of tissue type and age. The Academy considers the LNT model is only useful for regulatory purposes as it simplifies the administrative task. Quoting results from literature research, they furthermore claim that approximately 40% of laboratory studies on cell cultures and animals indicate some degree of chemical or radiobiological hormesis, and state:\\n\\n...its existence in the laboratory is beyond question and its mechanism of action appears well understood.\\n\\nThey go on to outline a growing body of research that illustrates that the human body is not a passive accumulator of radiation damage but it actively repairs the damage caused via a number of different processes, including:\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, increased sensitivity to radiation induced cancer in the inherited condition Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, illustrates the damaging effects of loss of the repair gene Mre11h resulting in the inability to fix DNA double-strand breaks.\\n\\nThe BEIR-VII report argued that, \"the presence of a true dose threshold demands totally error-free DNA damage response and repair.\" The specific damage they worry about is double strand breaks (DSBs) and they continue, \"error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in postirradiation cellular response, argues strongly against a DNA repair-mediated low-dose threshold for cancer initiation\". Recent research observed that DSBs caused by CAT scans are repaired within 24-hours and DSBs maybe more efficiently repaired at low doses, suggesting the risk ionizing radiation at low doses may not by directly proportional to the dose. However, it is not known if low dose ionizing radiation stimulates the repair of DSBs not caused by ionizing radiation \"i.e.\" a hormetic response. \\nRadon gas in homes is the largest source of radiation dose for most individuals and it is generally advised that the concentration be kept below 150 Bq/m³ (4 pCi/L). A recent retrospective case-control study of lung cancer risk showed substantial cancer rate reduction between 50 and 123 Bq per cubic meter relative to a group at zero to 25 Bq per cubic meter. This study is cited as evidence for hormesis, but a single study all by itself cannot be regarded as definitive. Other studies into the effects of domestic radon exposure have not reported a hormetic effect; including for example the respected \"Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study\" of Field et al. (2000), which also used sophisticated radon exposure dosimetry. In addition, Darby et al. (2005) argue that radon exposure is negatively correlated with the tendency to smoke and environmental studies need to accurately control for this; people living in urban areas where smoking rates are higher usually have lower levels of radon exposure due the increased prevalence of multi-story dwellings. When doing so, they found a significant increase in lung cancer amongst smokers exposed to radon at doses as low as 100 to 199 Bq m and warned that smoking greatly increases the risk posed by radon exposure \"i.e.\" reducing the prevalence of smoking would decrease deaths caused by radon. However, the discussion about the opposite experimental results is still going on, especially the popular US and German studies have found some hormetic effects.\\n\\nFurthermore, particle microbeam studies show that passage of even a single alpha particle (e.g. from radon and its progeny) through cell nuclei is highly mutagenic, and that alpha radiation may have a higher mutagenic effect at low doses (even if a small fraction of cells are hit by alpha particles) than predicted by linear no-threshold model, a phenomenon attributed to bystander effect. However, there is currently insufficient evidence at hand to suggest that the bystander effect promotes carcinogenesis in humans at low doses.\\n\\nSection::::Statements by leading nuclear bodies.\\nRadiation hormesis has not been accepted by either the United States National Research Council, or the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). In May 2018, the NCRP published the report of an interdisciplinary group of radiation experts who critically reviewed 29 high-quality epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to radiation in the low dose and low dose-rate range, mostly published within the last 10 years. The group of experts concluded:\\n\\nIn addition, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) wrote in its most recent report:\\nof tumour induction proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.\\n\\nThis is a reference to the fact that very low doses of radiation have only marginal impacts on individual health outcomes. It is therefore difficult to detect the \\'signal\\' of decreased or increased morbidity and mortality due to low-level radiation exposure in the \\'noise\\' of other effects. The notion of radiation hormesis has been rejected by the National Research Council\\'s (part of the National Academy of Sciences) 16-year-long study on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. \"The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial. The health risks – particularly the development of solid cancers in organs – rise proportionally with exposure\" says Richard R. Monson, associate dean for professional education and professor of epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston.\\n\\nSection::::Studies of low level radiation.\\nSection::::Very high natural background gamma radiation cancer rates at Kerala, India.\\nKerala\\'s monazite sand (containing a third of the world\\'s economically recoverable reserves of radioactive thorium) emits about 8 micro Sieverts per hour of gamma radiation, 80 times the dose rate equivalent in London, but a decade long study of 69,985 residents published in Health Physics in 2009: \"showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -0.13 Gy_1 (95% CI: -0.58, 0.46)\", indicating no statistically significant positive or negative relationship between background radiation levels and cancer risk in this sample.\\n\\nSection::::Cultures.\\nStudies in cell cultures can be useful for finding mechanisms for biological processes, but they also can be criticized for not effectively capturing the whole of the living organism.\\n\\nA study by E.I. Azzam suggested that pre-exposure to radiation causes cells to turn on protection mechanisms. A different study by de Toledo and collaborators, has shown that irradiation with gamma rays increases the concentration of glutathione, an antioxidant found in cells.\\n\\nIn 2011, an \"in vitro\" study led by S.V. Costes showed in time-lapse images a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended. Measured rates of RIF formation were 15 RIF/Gy at 2 Gy, and 64 RIF/Gy at .1 Gy. These results suggest that low dose levels of ionizing radiation may not increase cancer risk directly proportional to dose and thus contradict the linear-no-threshold standard model. Mina Bissell, a world-renowned breast cancer researcher and collaborator in this study stated “Our data show that at lower doses of ionizing radiation, DNA repair mechanisms work much better than at higher doses. This non-linear DNA damage response casts doubt on the general assumption that any amount of ionizing radiation is harmful and additive.”\\n\\nSection::::Animals.\\nAn early study on mice exposed to low dose of radiation daily (0.11 R per day) suggest that they may outlive control animals. A study by Otsuka and collaborators found hormesis in animals. Miyachi conducted a study on mice and found that a 200 mGy X-ray dose protects mice against both further X-ray exposure and ozone gas. In another rodent study, Sakai and collaborators found that (1 mGy/hr) gamma irradiation prevents the development of cancer (induced by chemical means, injection of methylcholanthrene).\\n\\nIn a 2006 paper, a dose of 1 Gy was delivered to the cells (at constant rate from a radioactive source) over a series of lengths of time. These were between 8.77 and 87.7 hours, the abstract states for a dose delivered over 35 hours or more (low dose rate) no transformation of the cells occurred. Also for the 1 Gy dose delivered over 8.77 to 18.3 hours that the biological effect (neoplastic transformation) was about \"1.5 times less than that measured at high dose rate in previous studies with a similar quality of [X-ray] radiation.\" Likewise it has been reported that fractionation of gamma irradiation reduces the likelihood of a neoplastic transformation. Pre-exposure to fast neutrons and gamma rays from Cs-137 is reported to increase the ability of a second dose to induce a neoplastic transformation.\\n\\nCaution must be used in interpreting these results, as it noted in the BEIR VII report, these pre-doses can also increase cancer risk:\\n\\nHowever, 75\\xa0mGy/d cannot be accurately described as a low dose rate – it is equivalent to over 27 sieverts per year. The same study on dogs showed no increase in cancer nor reduction in life expectancy for dogs irradiated at 3\\xa0mGy/d.\\n\\nSection::::Humans.\\nSection::::Effects of sunlight exposure.\\nIn an Australian study which analyzed the association between solar UV exposure and DNA damage, the results indicated that although the frequency of cells with chromosome breakage increased with increasing sun exposure, the misrepair of DNA strand breaks decreased as sun exposure was heightened.\\n\\nSection::::Effects of cobalt-60 exposure.\\nThe health of the inhabitants of radioactive apartment buildings in Taiwan has received prominent attention in popular treatments of radiation hormesis. In 1982, more than 20,000 tons of steel was accidentally contaminated with cobalt-60, and much of this radioactive steel was used to build apartments and exposed thousands of Taiwanese to gamma radiation levels of up to >1000 times background (average 47.7\\xa0mSv, maximum 2360\\xa0mSv excess cumulative dose) – it was not until 1992 that the radioactive contamination was discovered. A medical study published in 2004 claimed the cancer mortality rates in the exposed population were much lower than expected. However, this initial study failed to control for age, comparing a much younger exposed population (mean age 17.2 years at initial exposure) with the much older general population of Taiwan (mean age approx. 34 years in 2004), a serious flaw. Older people have much higher cancer rates even in the absence of excess radiation exposure.\\n\\nA subsequent study by Hwang \"et al.\" (2006) found the incidence of \"all cancers\" in the irradiated population was 40% lower than expected (95 vs. 160.3 cases expected), except for leukaemia in men (6 vs. 1.8 cases expected) and thyroid cancer in women (6 vs. 2.8 cases expected), an increase only detected amongst those exposed before the age of 30. Hwang \"et al.\" proposed that the lower rate of \"all cancers\" might be due to the exposed populations higher socioeconomic status and thus overall healthier lifestyle, but this was difficult to prove. Additionally, they cautioned that leukaemia was the first cancer type found to be elevated amongst the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, so it may be decades before any increase in more common cancer types is seen.\\n\\nBesides the excess risks of leukaemia and thyroid cancer, a later publication notes various DNA anomalies and other health effects among the exposed population:\\nThere have been several reports concerning the radiation effects on the exposed population, including cytogenetic analysis that showed increased micronucleus frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes in the exposed population, increases in acentromeric and single or multiple centromeric cytogenetic damages, and higher frequencies of chromosomal translocations, rings and dicentrics. Other analyses have shown persistent depression of peripheral leucocytes and neutrophils, increased eosinophils, altered distributions of lymphocyte subpopulations, increased frequencies of lens opacities, delays in physical development among exposed children, increased risk of thyroid abnormalities, and late consequences in hematopoietic adaptation in children.\\n\\nSection::::Effects of no radiation.\\nGiven the uncertain effects of low-level and very-low-level radiation, there is a pressing need for quality research in this area. An expert panel convened at the 2006 Ultra-Low-Level Radiation Effects Summit at Carlsbad, New Mexico, proposed the construction of an Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory. The laboratory, if built, will investigate the effects of almost \"no radiation\" on laboratory animals and cell cultures, and it will compare these groups to control groups exposed to natural radiation levels. Precautions would be made, for example, to remove potassium-40 from the food of laboratory animals. The expert panel believes that the Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory is the only experiment that can explore with authority and confidence the effects of low-level radiation; that it can confirm or discard the various radiobiological effects proposed at low radiation levels e.g. LNT, threshold and radiation hormesis.\\n\\nThe first preliminary results of the effects of almost no-radiation on cell cultures was reported by two research groups in 2011 and 2012; researchers in the US studied cell cultures protected from radiation in a steel chamber 650 meters underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico and researchers in Europe reported the effects of almost no-radiation on mouse cells (pKZ1 transgenic chromosomal inversion assay).\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Radiation hormesis', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106101'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11063687', 'text': 'Zoltán Blum\\n\\nZoltán Blum (also known as Zoltán Virág; 3 January 1892 – 25 December 1959) was a Hungarian amateur football (soccer) player who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nBlum was born in Pápa.

Her whereabouts remain unknown.\\n\\nMadeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann; her two-year-old twin siblings; and a group of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 55 metres (180\\xa0ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine\\'s mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given \"arguido\" (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal\\'s attorney general archived the case in July 2008 because of a lack of evidence.\\n\\nThe parents continued the investigation using private detectives until Scotland Yard opened its own inquiry, Operation Grange, in 2011.

They were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, one of several privately owned properties rented to holidaymakers.\\n\\n5A was a two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village, which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner\\'s Ocean Club resort. Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B, Jane Tanner and Russell O\\'Brien in 5D, and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor. The apartment block was not gated and 5A was at the corner of two roads, making it accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club\\'s pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A\\'s balcony and living room. 5A\\'s front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.\\n\\nThe McCanns\\' children slept in a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents\\' car park, which was separated from the street by a low wall. Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite side of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was an empty single bed beneath the window.\\n\\nSection::::Thursday, 3 May 2007.\\nSection::::20:30: Tapas restaurant.\\nThursday, 3 May, was the penultimate day of the family\\'s holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn\\'t you come when [her brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children\\'s bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine\\'s pyjama top.\\n\\nThe children spent the morning in the resort\\'s Kids\\' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool. The children returned to Kids\\' Club, then at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed at around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer\\'s Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.\\n\\nAt 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club\\'s open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160\\xa0ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295\\xa0ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.\\n\\nThe resort\\'s staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool reception area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening for the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group\\'s children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine\\'s mother believes the abductor may have seen the note. The McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine\\'s father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children\\'s bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant.\\n\\nSection::::21:15: Tanner sighting.\\nThe sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine\\'s father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.\\n\\nTanner told the police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man carrying a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine\\'s bedroom, heading east, away from the front of apartment 5A. In the early days of the investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case\\'s first suspect.\\n\\nThe child in the man\\'s arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine\\'s. Tanner described the man as white, dark-haired, 5\\xa0ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine\\'s Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man \"(left)\", which was released in October 2007.\\n\\nThe sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring. In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche. Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner\\'s report. Operation Grange\\'s lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were \"almost certain\" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.\\n\\nSection::::22:00: Smith sighting.\\nThe dismissal of the Tanner sighting allowed investigators to focus on a report made to Portuguese police on 26 May 2007 by Martin and Mary Smith.\\nAt around 22:00, the Smiths saw a man on Rua da Escola Primária, from the McCanns\\' apartment, walking away from the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in–5\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on \"Crimewatch\".\\n\\nScotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine\\'s kidnap.\\n\\nSection::::22:00: Reported missing.\\nMadeleine\\'s mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns\\' children\\'s bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Portuguese police accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.\\n\\nKate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio doors at the back, and noticing that the children\\'s bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine\\'s Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming \"Madeleine\\'s gone! Someone\\'s taken her!\"\\n\\nAt around 22:10 Madeleine\\'s father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort\\'s reception desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4\\'s \"Dispatches\" that, from one end of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.\\n\\nSection::::Early response.\\nSection::::Portuguese police.\\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, five miles (8\\xa0km) away. At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária (PJ), in nearby Portimão. Kate McCann said the PJ arrived just after 01:00. According to the PJ, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted. At 02:00 two patrol dogs were brought to the resort and at 08:00 four search-and-rescue dogs. Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins. Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the PJ in Portimão, became the inquiry\\'s coordinator.\\n\\nIt was widely acknowledged that mistakes were made during the so-called \"golden hours\" soon after the disappearance. Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches. According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10:00 the next morning. Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz the night of the disappearance, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information. It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert.\\n\\nNot everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them. The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine\\'s bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one \"stranger\" had been found, but around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the PJ. According to Madeleine\\'s mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children\\'s bedroom, but left at 03:00 without securing the apartment. The PJ case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests. A similar situation arose outside the apartment. A crowd gathered by the front door of 5A, including next to the children\\'s bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window\\'s exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.\\n\\nSection::::British police.\\nIn the UK it was agreed that Madeleine\\'s home force, Leicestershire police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry. A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The PJ gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, the information was collected in boxes. In addition the PJ had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates\\' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for Anthony Summers\\' and Robbyn Swan\\'s book \"Looking for Madeleine\" (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\".\\n\\nAt her parents\\' request, Madeleine was made a ward of court in England shortly after her disappearance, giving the court statutory powers to act on her behalf.\\n\\nSection::::Media and PR.\\nA PJ officer acknowledged in 2010 that the Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start, because of the \"media circus\". Gerry McCann told \"Vanity Fair\" in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive. Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers. This was apparently unprecedented.\\n\\nThe first government press officer was Sheree Dodd, a former \"Daily Mirror\" journalist, who was followed by Clarence Mitchell, director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information. When the government withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major\\'s private secretary. In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor and offered to cover Clarence Mitchell\\'s salary so that he could return. Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine\\'s Fund.\\n\\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine\\'s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007 to raise money and awareness; its website attracted 58 million hits in the first two days. Throughout May and June the couple\\'s PR team arranged events to give reporters a news peg. There was a visit to the Portuguese city of Fátima, where three children had reported a Marian apparition in 1917, as well as trips to Holland, Germany, Spain, and Morocco. On 30 May 2007, accompanied by reporters, the couple flew to Rome—in Sir Philip Green\\'s Learjet—to meet Pope Benedict XVI, a visit arranged by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O\\'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster. The following month balloons were let off in 300 cities around the world. From early June journalists began to voice concerns. The \"sheer professionalism of it\\xa0... troubled journalists\", according to Matthew Parris. Placing Madeleine on the front page of a British newspaper would sell up to 30,000 extra copies. She appeared on the cover of \"People\" magazine on 28 May 2007, on the front page of several British tabloids every day for almost six months, and became one of Sky News\\'s menu options: \"UK News\", \"Madeleine\", \"World News\". Between May 2007 and July 2008, the Portuguese tabloid \"Correio da Manhã\" published 384 articles about her. By June 2008 over seven million posts and 3,680 videos were returned in a search for her name on YouTube.\\n\\nSection::::First Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008).\\nSection::::First \"arguido\".\\nTwelve days after the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first \"arguido\". Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother\\'s house, \"Casa Liliana\", 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an \"arguido\" after a \"Sunday Mirror\" journalist told police he had been asking a lot of questions about the case. The PJ had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine\\'s age.\\n\\nThree members of the Tapas Seven—Fiona Payne, Russell O\\'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside apartment 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister and the other a businesswoman. This would not have been surprising considering how close Murat lived to 5A, but he and his mother said he had been at home all evening. The McCann circle was clearly suspicious of Murat: one of the McCanns\\' supporters offered Richard Bilton, a BBC reporter, \"exclusive access to any new developments in the case\" if Bilton would report back what the press pack was saying about Murat. Beginning on 15 May 2007, Murat\\'s home was searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, and two of his associates questioned. In March 2008, one of those associates had his car torched, with the word \"fala\" (\"speak\") sprayed in red on the pavement.\\n\\nThere was nothing to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat\\'s \"arguido\" status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what \"The Observer\" said was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the PJ on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat\\'s mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.\\n\\nSection::::Witness statements.\\nIn statements to the PJ, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days leading up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns\\' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.\\n\\nOn 20 April, four hundred yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking manpushy and intimidatingasked a tourist in her apartment for money for an orphanage. On 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street; polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On the day of the disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.\\n\\nAn \"ugly\" blonde-haired man was seen on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete, and again on 2 May across the road from 5A, apparently watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A\\'s former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, \"ugly\" with spots. On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns\\' apartment block, where a white van was parked.\\n\\nIn the late afternoon of 3 May, a girl on the balcony of the apartment immediately above 5A saw a man leave through the gate belowas though from a ground-floor apartmentand look around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns\\' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.\\n\\nSection::::McCanns as \"arguidos\".\\nSection::::Early suspicion.\\nThe first indication that the media was turning against the McCanns was on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance. On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in \"Sol\", a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements, and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented. The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens\\' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak.\\n\\nThis and later articles in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media. They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were \"swingers\", that the McCanns had been sedating their children, and that the group had formed a \"pact of silence\" regarding what had happened the night of the disappearance. Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns\\' and Tapas Seven\\'s statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies. According to Kate McCann, the statements were then typed up in Portuguese, and verbally translated back into English for the interviewees to sign.\\n\\nAmong the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the PJ case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the \"Sunday Times\" in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children\\'s bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead. The PJ also questioned why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had run to the restaurant leaving the twins alone in 5A, when she could have used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A\\'s rear balcony.\\nAnother issue was whether the exterior shutter over Madeleine\\'s bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the PJ that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.\\n\\nThe apparent discrepancies contributed to the view of the PJ that there had been no abduction. Kate\\'s shout of \"they\\'ve taken her\" was viewed with suspicion, as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story. Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance. In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC \"Panorama\" that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.\\n\\nSection::::Portugal sends a letter rogatory.\\nOn 28 June 2007 the McCanns suggested to the PJ that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a \"matter orientation system\", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites. On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his \"BS detector to go off the scale\". Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel\\'s claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a \"static signal\" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.\\n\\nThe officer in charge of the PJ inquiry, Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, interpreted Kate\\'s support of Krugel as a ploy. By this point he believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance, and that Kate was using Krugel—she had also considered using psychics—to \"disclose the location of her daughter\\'s body\" without compromising herself.\\n\\nWith this in mind, the PJ sent a letter rogatory to the British police to ask for assistance in their search for Madeleine\\'s body. In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter. His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel\\'s ideas as \"highly unlikely\". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, with the exception of a search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat\\'s property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven\\'s apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.\\n\\nSection::::British sniffer dogs arrive.\\nKeela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a \"passive alert\" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position. Eddie was a cadaver dog or enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated or in water. He was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason.\\n\\nThe dogs arrived in Praia da Luz on 31 July 2007, and were taken to apartment 5A, nearby wasteland, and the beach. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room of 5A, and Eddie gave an alert near the wardrobe in the main bedroom. There were no alerts on the beach or wasteland. The PJ obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns\\' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend\\'s Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible\\'s owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about the death of a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes. A source close to the McCanns\\' lawyers told reporters that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate\\'s clothes, it could have been caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor.\\n\\nThe police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance, and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the PJ headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns\\' and Robert Murat\\'s. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns\\' car by the driver\\'s door. \\nThe next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver\\'s side inside the boot (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver\\'s door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.\\n\\nSection::::British DNA analysis.\\nHair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007. At this point, according to the \"Sunday Times\", the PJ \"abandoned the abduction theory\". On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, PJ regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry. When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, \"The Daily Telegraph\" identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns. Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate\\'s memory was faulty.\\n\\nThe FSS used a technique known as low copy number (LCN) testing. Used when only a few cells are available, the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation. On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police, the liaison officer between the British and Portuguese police. Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine\\'s DNA components, and that the result was \"too complex for meaningful interpretation\":\\n\\nA complex LCN [low copy number] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section\\xa0... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart.\\xa0... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item; there are 37 components in total. There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors; but there could be up to five contributors. In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation/inclusion.\\xa0... [W]e cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match.\\n\\nSection::::McCanns made \"arguidos\".\\nThe Forensic Science Service email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the PJ proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given \"arguido\" status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The PJ told Gerry that Madeleine\\'s DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.\\n\\nThe DNA evidence was a \"100 percent match\", journalists in Portugal were told. British tabloid headlines included \"Brit Lab Bombshell: Car DNA is 100% Maddie\\'s\" (\"The Sun\", 11 September 2007) and \"Corpse in McCann Car\" (\"London Evening Standard\", 16 October 2007), while the \"Daily Star\" reported that a \"clump of Maddie\\'s hair\" had been found in the car. Jerry Lawton, a \"Daily Star\" reporter, told the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police. Matt Baggott—who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of Leicestershire Police, the force that coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese were in charge of the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force\\'s priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the PJ with a view to finding Madeleine.\\n\\nSection::::McCanns return to the UK, Almeida report.\\nDespite their \"arguido\" status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007. The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the PJ in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the restaurant meal and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns\\' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate\\'s diary and Gerry\\'s laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.\\n\\nOn 28 September 2007, according to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010, the American ambassador to Portugal, Al Hoffman, wrote about a meeting he had had with the British ambassador to Portugal, Alexander Ellis, on 21 September 2007. The cable said: \"Without delving into the details of the case, Ellis admitted that the British police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents, and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working co-operatively. He commented that the media frenzy was to be expected and was acceptable as long as government officials keep their comments behind closed doors.\"\\n\\nIn the UK Control Risks, a British security company—paid by an anonymous donor to assist the McCanns since 7 May 2007—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September 2007, at their parents\\' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the PJ files, Kate had asked them to take samples, three months after the disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found. \\n\\nSection::::Gonçalo Amaral\\'s removal, later developments.\\nOn 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry\\'s coordinator, was removed from his post and transferred from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper \"Diário de Notícias\" that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns and had ignored that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.\\n\\nAmaral was himself an \"arguido\" in relation to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. Amaral was made \"arguido\" one day after Madeleine\\'s disappearance; the following month he was charged with making a false statement and four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana Cipriano had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11\\xa0km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother\\'s brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.\\n\\nThe Madeleine inquiry was taken over by Paulo Rebelo, deputy national director of the PJ, which expanded its team of detectives and began a case review. On 29 November 2007 four members of the Portuguese inquiry, including Francisco Corte-Real, vice-president of Portugal\\'s forensic crime service, were briefed at Leicestershire police headquarters by the British Forensic Science Service. In April 2008 the Tapas Seven were interviewed by Leicestershire police in England, with the PJ in attendance. The PJ planned the following month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate. The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, on the day the couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the PJ were leaked to Spanish television. The national director of the PJ, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects. Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.\\n\\nSection::::Inquiry closed (21 July 2008).\\nOn 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance. Their \"arguido\" status was lifted and the case was closed. Monteiro said in a statement:\\n\\nThe case involving Madeleine McCann will be shelved following the decision by the two magistrates in charge that no evidence was found to implicate the arguidos. Hereby the condition of all three arguidos ceases\\xa0... and the bail measures imposed upon the same have expired. If they appeal against the decision it can be reopened.\\xa0... The inquiry may be reopened by decision of prosecuting council or by request of any of those involved if new, serious and relevant evidence emerges.\\n\\nOn 4 August Portugal\\'s Ministério Público released 17 case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings. The files included a 58-page prosecutors\\' report, which concluded: \"No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances.\" In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages. Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate McCann\\'s diary, which had been taken by the PJ in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, \"Correio da Manhã\", despite a Portuguese judge\\'s ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed. On 14 September 2008 a News International tabloid, \"News of the World\", published the extracts, again without permission and now translated poorly back into English.\\n\\nSection::::Amaral\\'s book (24 July 2008).\\nIn July 2008, Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaralby then retiredpublished a book alleging that Madeleine had died in the McCann\\'s appartment. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies and by 2010 had been translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book, broadcast in Portugal in 2009, was seen by 2.2 million people.\\n\\nIn 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages against Amaral and his publisher, but this was overturned on appeal. A 2009 injunction halting sale of the book was overturned in 2010, reinstated in conjunction with the libel ruling, then lifted again when the libel judgment was overturned in 2016. The McCanns appealed to Portugal\\'s Supreme Court, which ruled that they had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Madeleine\\'s Fund inquiry (2007–2011).\\nSection::::Raising money.\\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine\\'s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, 12 days after the disappearance. Over 80 million people visited the fund\\'s website, \"Find Madeleine\", in the three months after the disappearance. From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy\\'s lawyer joined the fund\\'s board of directors.\\n\\nAppeals were made by public figures and screened at football matches across Britain. Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise. Donations included £250,000 from the \"News of the World\", £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney. J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns. The fund did not cover the couple\\'s legal costs arising from their status as \"arguidos\", but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns\\' mortgage payments, before they were made \"arguidos\".\\n\\nA reward of £2.5 million was also offered, including from the \"News of the World\", Rowling, Branson, Green, and a Scottish businessman, Stephen Winyard. In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 in the form of libel damages arising out of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively. In 2011 Kate McCann\\'s book, \"Madeleine\", was serialized by \"The Sun\" and \"The Sunday Times\", both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million. In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000. it had seven directors, including the McCanns.\\n\\nSection::::Private investigators.\\nMadeleine\\'s Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with the Portuguese police. Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks. There had reportedly been four independent sightings from North Africa; Brian Kennedy went to Morocco himself in September 2007 to look into one sighting. A Norwegian woman had reported seeing a girl matching Madeleine\\'s description in a petrol station near Marrakesh, Morocco, on 9 May 2007; the child had reportedly asked the man she was with, in English, \"Can we see Mummy soon?\" When the witness returned home to Spain, she learned about the disappearance and telephoned the Spanish police. A month later, according to Kate McCann, the police had still not formally interviewed the woman, which led the McCanns to fear that leads were not being pursued. The McCanns themselves travelled to Morocco on 10 June 2007 to raise awareness. They spent the night at the British ambassador\\'s residence and were briefed by consular staff and a Metropolitan police attaché.\\n\\nBrian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. It seems the relationship came to an end in part because the head of the agency made several public statements that concerned the McCanns, including to CBS that \"We know the kidnapper. We know who he is and how he has done it.\" Another private investigator was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector hired in 2009 on the recommendation of the head of Manchester\\'s Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August that year of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.\\n\\nSection::::Oakley International.\\nIn 2008 Madeleine\\'s Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months. (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation. He died in 2018.) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community.\\n\\nExton questioned the significance of the Tanner sighting of a man carrying a child at 21:15 near apartment 5A, and focused instead on the Smith sighting at 22:00—the sighting by Martin and Mary Smith of a man carrying a child toward the beach. The Oakley team based on the Smiths\\' description. This was a sensitive issue, because on 9 September 2007 Martin Smith had watched BBC footage of the McCanns arrive in the UK from Portugal, at the height of public debate about their alleged involvement. As Gerry McCann exited the aircraft with his son in his arms, Smith believed he recognized him as the man he had seen carrying the child in Praia da Luz. He reported his suspicion to Leicestershire police but later came to accept that he was mistaken: at 22:00 witnesses placed Gerry in the tapas restaurant. Nevertheless, publication of the Smith e-fits, which bore some resemblance to Gerry, would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns.\\n\\nExton submitted his report to Madeleine\\'s Fund in November 2008, and suggested releasing the e-fits, but the fund told Exton that the report and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between the company and the fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. Madeleine\\'s Fund passed the e-fits to the police—the PJ and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, \"Madeleine\" (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial. Scotland Yard released the e-fits in October 2013 for a BBC \"Crimewatch\" reconstruction. After it had aired, \"The Sunday Times\" published that the McCanns had had the e-fits since 2008. In response the couple complained that the \"Sunday Times\" story implied (wrongly) that the McCanns had not only failed to publish the e-fits but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper published an apology on an inside page in December 2013. The McCanns subsequently sued and received £55,000 in damages, which Gerry McCann said would be donated to charity.\\n\\nSection::::Further police inquiries (2011–present).\\nSection::::Gamble report.\\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case. Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble, then head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). By March 2010 the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a British inquiry.\\n\\nDelivered in May 2010, the Gamble report examined how several British agencies had become involved in the search for Madeleine, including CEOP itself, Leicestershire police, the Metropolitan Police Service, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the National Police Improvement Agency, Crimestoppers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street.\\n\\nGamble criticized the lack of coordination. Everyone had wanted to help, and some had wanted \"to be seen to help\", he wrote, which had \"created a sense of chaos and a sense of competition\", hampering the inquiry by causing resentment among the Portuguese police. He recommended renewed cooperation between the British and Portuguese, that all relevant information be exchanged between the police forces, that police perform an analysis of telephone calls made on the night of the disappearance, and that all leads be pursued, including those developed by private detectives.\\n\\nSection::::Operation Grange.\\nIn May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians. The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, \"The Sun\". On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann\\'s book, \"Madeleine\", \"The Sun\"s front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper\\'s petition that day. On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of \"The Sun\". The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry. Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.\\n\\nOperation Grange was led by Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard\\'s Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall. By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.\\n\\nThe team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an age-progressed image, and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four. In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved additional funding of £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry; another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year; and £150,000 in November 2018 to cover until 31 March 2019, taking the cost of the inquiry to £11.75 million.\\n\\nSection::::Theories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off.\\nDCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a \"criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns\\' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows. In an interview in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard\\'s Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the \"burglary gone wrong\" hypothesis, while adding that it was \"not entirely ruled out\". Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had \"pretty much closed off that group of people\". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of inquiries that they believed were significant. Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard was looking for a woman seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance.\\n\\nRedwood said in 2013 that, \"on one reading of the evidence\", the disappearance did look like a pre-planned abduction, which \"undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance\". Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself. In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British expats. In October 2013 Scotland Yard and the BBC\\'s \"Crimewatch\" staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting. Days after \"Crimewatch\" aired, Portugal\\'s attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.\\n\\nAnother theory is that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the apartment by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one of the open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.\\n\\nSection::::Tracking mobile phone calls.\\nUsing mobile-phone tracking techniques, police were able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of the disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries. The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.\\n\\nPolice also found that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.\\n\\nSection::::Holiday-home sexual assaults.\\nScotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The PJ reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Searches and interviews in Praia da Luz.\\nIn June 2014 officers from Scotland Yard and the PJ, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz. Nothing was found. The following month, at Scotland Yard\\'s request, the PJ in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance. No evidence was found to implicate them. One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance. Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the PJ, told the BBC in 2017 that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard had requested them: \"We never saw or looked at those people as suspects of the crime.\" Eleven people, including three Britons, were interviewed in December 2014. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions for the interviewees, including \"Did you kill Madeleine?\" and \"Where did you hide the body?\" Robert Murat, his wife, and her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. The bus driver and associates had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance. They admitted to having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine.\\n\\nSection::::Other inquiries.\\nIn the early days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine\\'s parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who had been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.\\n\\nA man from Northern Ireland who died in 2013 was discussed in the media in connection with the disappearance; after being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man who had been living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared; Aesch was implicated in the murder of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard, who disappeared in Switzerland three months after Madeleine and was later found poisoned. In June 2016 Operation Grange officers interviewed a victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse. Freud had had a home in Praia da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance. His family said he was in the UK when Madeleine went missing.\\n\\nSection::::Tabloids and social media.\\nSection::::\"Trial by media\".\\nEilis O\\'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\". Twitter, one year old when Madeleine went missing, became the source of much of the vitriol against the McCanns. Ten years later, the McCann hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield. Social media\\'s attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns\\' twins, and when Scotland Yard and \"Crimewatch\" staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was apparently talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal. One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations. The following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets.\\n\\nThe couple\\'s status as photogenic, articulate and professional was at first beneficial and protective. A white middle-class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down. The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the \"monstering of the McCanns\". They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges. Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.\\n\\nKate McCann\\'s appearance and demeanour were widely discussed, with much of the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the \"London Review of Books\". Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid \"Correio da Manhã\" cited sources complaining that she had not \"shed a single tear\". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she had not wept in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: \"How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?\"\\n\\nIn November 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards. The inquiry heard that the editor of the \"Daily Express\", in particular, had become \"obsessed\" with the couple. \"Express\" headlines included that Madeleine had been \"killed by sleeping pills\", \"Find body or McCanns will escape\", and McCanns or a friend must be to blame, the latter based on an interview with a waiter. \"Maddie \\'Sold\\' By Hard-Up McCanns\" ran a headline in the \"Daily Star\", part of the Express group. Lord Justice Leveson called the articles \"complete piffle\". Roy Greenslade described them as \"no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\".\\n\\nSection::::Libel actions.\\nIn addition to the McCanns\\' legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers. The \"Daily Express\", \"Daily Star\" and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine\\'s Fund. The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine\\'s Fund, along with an apology in the \"Daily Express\". The McCanns received £55,000 from \"The Sunday Times\" in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police.\\n\\nRobert Murat received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in relation to 100 articles published by 11 newspapers—\"The Sun\" and \"News of the World\" (News International), \"Daily Express\", \"Sunday Express\" and \"Daily Star\" (Northern & Shell), \"Daily Mail\", \"London Evening Standard\" and \"Metro\" (Associated Newspapers), \"Daily Mirror\", \"Sunday Mirror\" and \"Daily Record\" (Mirror Group Newspapers). According to \"The Observer\", it was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue. His two associates were each awarded $100,000, and all three received public apologies.

The population was 203 at the 2010 census.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe community was named for President Benjamin Harrison, due to a large wood mill and stop for mining boats coming off the nearby Coeur d\\'Alene River.\\n\\nHarrison was incorporated in 1899 and was once the largest city on Lake Coeur d\\'Alene.\\n\\nHarrison developed from a squatters homestead to a thriving village in about twelve years. A branch of the O.R. & N. Railroad from Tekoa, Washington, to Harrison was completed in 1890 and was a prime factor in the development of Harrison.\\n\\nIn 1891, Silas W. Crane settled on a timbered tract which joins the present city on the south and east. He built the first house in Harrison which remained in the Crane family until 1936. The building is now used as the Crane House Museum. The same year Fred Grant purchased the Fisher Brothers Sawmill in St. Maries and moved it to Harrison. Known as Grants Mill, it had a capacity of 60 thousand feet per day.\\n\\nIn 1892, S.W. Crane opened a general store. The first post office was established in 1893, the name was chosen and W.E. Crane became the first postmaster. W.S. Bridgeman opened a Gen. Merc. in 1893, and another general store was opened in 1894 by W.A. Reiniger.\\n\\nThe first newspaper, \"The Signal\", was established in 1895, later it was known as the \"Mountain Messenger\" and in 1900 became known as \"The Searchlight\". A paper with that name is still published annually by the Oldtime Picnic Committee.\\n\\nIn 1895, a Methodist church was erected and School District #29 was formed. The first year of school was taught by Mr. Edelbute in the Methodist Church. The first school was erected in 1896 and by 1903 there were 59 students.\\n\\nThe original townsite was in the form of a triangle and covered approximately . The Village of Harrison was incorporated on July 21, 1899. The first meeting of the Board of Trustees for the Village of Harrison was held July 24, 1899. George W. Thompson was elected chairman.\\n\\nIn August 1905, a Spokane company was granted a franchise to put in a water system with a pumping plant at a cost of $20,000. An electric light plant was also installed in 1901 by Kimmel Brothers at a cost of $8,000.\\n\\nThe following year came the telephone, connecting Harrison with points up the St. Joe and Coeur d’Alene rivers. Rocky Mountain Bell purchased the property later that year and Harrison was connected to outside world.\\n\\nThe next few years saw the opening of the First National Bank of Harrison, the Opera House, various drug, grocery, hardware, furniture, clothing & jewelry stores along with tailoring, blacksmithing and shoemaker shops, and restaurants, hotels and a hospital. For a time around the turn of the century, Harrison was the largest town in Kootenai County; the city directory in 1911 reported a population of 1,250. Harrison\\'s growth was a result of the development of eight or more sawmills & box factories. With the mills and woods jobs, approx. 280 men were employed with a combined monthly payroll around $25,000. Millions of board feet of timber were stored in the lake at Harrison. Lake Coeur d’Alene and the St.Joe and Coeur d’Alene rivers were the major transportation routes for timber coming out of the areas forests.\\n\\nIn 1917, the Grant Lumber Company caught fire and the ensuing blaze consumed about half of the residential area of Harrison and about half of the business district. Much of the town was never rebuilt. The easiest way to get to Harrison was by water. The OWR&N Company which absorbed the OR&N railroad, constructed a 600-passenger steamer called “The Harrison” for transportation. There were several other steamers such as the Georgie Oakes that carried pas-sengers and freight making the depot a popular place for area children. Passenger service was discontinued in the early 1920s but they continued to haul freight until 1932 when the line was abandoned.\\n\\nMany early day photos are on display at the Crane Historical Society Museum along with a lot of information about Harrison. Community spirit continues today with the Old Time Picnic, which is always held the last weekend in July.\\n\\nHarrison\\'s trail head for the Trail of the Coeur d\\'Alenes rail trail is a welcome addition to the area and helps to keep the town \"alive\" during the off season of lake traffic. The Trail is of easy riding and runs from Plummer to Mullan on the former right-of-way of the Union Pacific Railroad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nHarrison is located at (47.449779, -116.780674).\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\\n\\nHarrison is located south of Interstate 90 on the Lake Coeur d\\'Alene Scenic Byway, Highway 97.\\n\\nThe Coeur d\\'Alene River flows into Lake Coeur d\\'Alene on Harrison\\'s northern edge. The lower reaches of the river\\'s valley are filled with smaller lakes, and as such water dominates much of the local geography. The Saint Joe Mountains of the Bitterroot Range rise high above the flat lakes around Harrison.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nSection::::2010 census.\\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203 people, 100 households, and 54 families residing in the city.

Honyaki as a term alone can refer to either mizu honyaki (water-quench) or abura honyaki (oil quench). The goal is to produce a sharper, longer lasting edge than is usually achievable with the lamination method. The term has been adapted to describe high-end mono-stainless in Japan and carbon blades by non-Japanese bladesmiths that have a hamon but are made with Western steel, heat treat, equipment, finishing (etching and polishing), and design.\\n\\nSection::::Traditional process.\\nFuel and steel: Pine charcoal is cut to size for use in the fire as gentle heat for the blade before quench. Coke is the most common fuel to forge the blade to shape and is preheated to remove remaining sulfur and phosphorus. Gas is cheaper and may also be used but may yield lower quality, whereas pine charcoal may yield higher quality but it is more expensive. An electric fan is used or a box bellow to feed air into the forge. The steel is usually one of the carbon knife steels Hitachi produces at Yasugi Specialty Steel. These are the unalloyed White steel (1, 2, 3) and the tungsten and chromium alloyed Blue steel (1, 2, Super), with White 2 the most common and Blue 2 the next most produced. Less common is White 1 and White 3 and rarely used is Blue Super used (because it is much harder to forge due the resiliency to stretching from the alloying), and even less common is tamahagane (as the steel is expensive, much more difficult to process, and must be correctly forge welded and flattened).\\n\\nSteel qualities and quenchant: Blacksmith skill aside and specific heat treatment aside, the 1 versions (higher carbon) are harder, more wear resistant, more fragile and harder to forge, harder to sharpen, and harder to straighten.. The 3 versions (lower carbon, at the eutectoid point) are not necessarily softer, but often tougher, easier to sharpen, and easier to make. Blue steel is more difficult to forge, sharpen, and straighten (because the \"soft\" steel covered by clay still hardens). To perform traditional water quench on this steel can exacerbate the formation of cracks because of its deeper hardening. White steel 1 is difficult to forge and to quench from its higher carbon and can become harder and more brittle than White 2. A water quench with these traditional steels and processes will result in a blade that is harder, stiffer, sharper with longer lasting sharpness but that is harder to sharpen and relatively less tough. An oil quench with the same steels will result in a blade that is marginally less hard, stiff, sharp with less lasting sharpness but that is easier to sharpen and more tough. The choice of quenchant depends on user preference of blade qualities.\\n\\nForging: Unlike awase bocho, honyaki in general have no need to raise to forge welding heat. This skips the possible carbon migration to the mild steel and decarburization from the heating to around 1000 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the smith skips the need to weld the layers careful under careful heating and to evenly forge the core steel. In this regard to forging white 2 steel, honyaki is easier than in awase bocho. More alloy and higher carbon make this more difficult. There are multiple re-heatings and forging from high temperatures downward. Blades are cooled and annealed in carbonized rice straw or ash, cut to rough shape, cold forged, and corrected for distortion multiple times. They are preferably left to stabilize for a bit between each step to help reduce distortion. The knife is rough ground to shape with the omote, urasuki, and profile. These steps generally require more effort than with laminated knives.\\n\\nQuenching: A paste is applied to the blade using water, charcoal, clay, ground natural sharpening stone, and other ingredients in a proprietary way and composition. This thicker paste goes on the blade spine on both sides and traditionally mimics the wavy hamon of nihonto. A thinner slip goes on the hard edge to help heat transfer there. It then must dry in air or over heat. The quench water or oil is prepared and brought to the right temperature. The forge is heated. Lights are turned off and the room shut from the outside. Once ready, the blade is buried and shuffled around in the charcoal and when it reaches the correct temperature it is thrust into water and moved forward and back (so as to prevent lateral distortion) and then after a couple seconds side to side. The knife could also be brought up slightly above temperature and then held in the room to the correct temperature before quench. The quench could be interrupted toward the end for more rough grinding or to correct distortion. The blade is tempered either immediately over fire, or in oil, or in an oven. The water quench regularly destroys many blades by cracking them or warping them too badly to reasonably sell.\\n\\nSharpening and finishing: It is preferably left to sit while the knife age hardens so that when the knife is made straight, few if any distortions appear as the knife ages further. If is made under the Sakai, Osaka production system, the knife is sent to a sharpener who corrects for distortion and sharpnens simultaneously to make the final geometry and profile of the knife, and then finished by polishing, engraving, and installation of handle by other craftsmen. It may be mirror polished or finished with natural stones to highlight the hamon, resist rusting, and improve balance and some honyaki display alloy banding upon polish. The handle is installed and a saya is usually made. Ebony fittings denote ornamental display as the wood is hard enough to scratch the blade in the saya and the ebony can crack under changes in humidity, and the extra weight may make holding the knife more tiring but can help balance with longer blades. If used for work, it represents the status of the cost and knowledge of proper care and use. The extra labor in manufacture, sharpening, and finishing, time lost to failed blades, and skill in temperature control and forging contributes to the higher price compared to usual laminated blades.\\n\\nSection::::Culture and use.\\nCraftsman: Honyaki is the application of Japanese swordsmithing tradition. Blacksmithing backgrounds (specialty, personality, geography, family lineage, teacher, knowledge, money, tradition, business structure) differ and accordingly produce different interpretation of the technique. It usually represents the best work of all craftsmen involved.\\n\\nChef: Traditionally chefs first learn to use stainless, then kasumi, hon-kasumi, and finally mizu or abura honyaki. The honyaki knives are usually used only after completion of an apprenticeship after becoming proficient in ingredients, cooking, sharpening, and knife use. Honyaki knives are usually harder to sharpen in comparison to laminated blades because they have no mild steel that is quickly removed and are usually even harder. They usually chip more easily in use and sharpening and are extra sensitive to hard surfaces including in sharpening. As the edge is more fragile, the user must know how to hold, cut, sharpen, store, and care for it.\\n\\nLaminated vs Honyaki: From a strictly heat treat and microscopy point of view, there should be no difference between a laminated and honyaki steel with the same observed structure and heat threat process, but the heat treat necessarily differs, and many users say there is benefit to honyaki. Many users also prefer laminated blades for ease of maintenance, sharpening feel, cost, and toughness. Many blacksmiths prefer laminated blades because at the minimum, they are easier to produce. At the highest levels they have core steel of comparable hardness and sharpness and are not necessarily easier to make due to the skill to forge weld at lower temperatures, with minimal loss of carbon, less flux and iron powder, and with minimal scars while stretching out the laminate. Pattern welding (suminagashi) requires its own skill as well and can produce a stiffer awase knife with less distortion during use and sharpening.\\n\\nSection::::Makers and brands.\\nAs Sakai is the kitchen knife capital of Japan, many honyaki come from there.\\n\\nBrands that offer honyaki include Akifusa, Aritsugu, Ashi Hamono, Carter Cutlery, Fudo Kuniyuki, Gesshin, Ino, Ittotsai Kotetsu, Kikuichimonji, Hiromoto, Konosuke, Masamoto Sohonten, Masamoto Tsukiji, Minamoto Izumimasa, Mizuno Tanrenjo, Monzaburo, Nenohi, Sakai Takayuki, Singatirin, Suisin, Sukenari, Tesshu, Tsubaya, Yamamoto Haken (Hide), Yoshihiro/Yamawaki.\\n\\nBlacksmiths who have produced honyaki include Futoshi Nagao, Genkai, Hiroki Ashi, Kenichi Shiraki, Kenji Togashi, Kiyoshi Kato, Jyunichi Takagi, Okishiba Masakuni, Tatsuo Ikeda, Watanabe, Yasha Yukawa, and Yoshikazu Ikeda.\\n\\nStainless \"honyaki\" (actually zenko) include Suisin Inox Honyaki and Masahiro MV Honyaki.\\n\\nMakers of Western style \"honyaki\" include Cris Anderson, Mert Tansu, Bill Burke, Bryan Raquin, William Catchside, and Bob Kramer.\\n', 'title': 'Honyaki', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11077547'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'OhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11078032', 'text': '2005 Fed Cup World Group II\\n\\nThe World Group II was the second highest level of Fed Cup competition in 2005.

Eaton co-founded the Rensselaer School in 1824 with Stephen van Rensselaer III \"in the application of science to the common purposes of life\". His books in the eighteenth century were among the first published for which a systematic treatment of the United States was attempted, and in a language that all could read. His teaching laboratory for botany in the 1820s was the first of its kind in the country. Eaton\\'s popular lectures and writings inspired numerous thinkers, in particular women, whom he encouraged to attend his public talks on experimental philosophy. Emma Willard would found the Troy Female Seminary (Emma Willard School), and Mary Mason Lyon, the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (Mount Holyoke College). Eaton held the rank of senior professor at Rensselaer until his death in 1842.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nAmos Eaton was born at Chatham, Columbia County, New York on May 17, 1776. His father, Captain Abel Eaton was a farmer of comfortable means. He belonged to a family that traced its lineage to John Eaton, who arrived from Dover, England in 1635, settling two years later in Dedham, Massachusetts Bay Colony. Amos Eaton showed early preference for nature, by the age of sixteen constructing his own compass and chain to survey land as a chain bearer.\\n\\nEaton was sent to Williamstown with the Rev. Dr. David Potter, of Spencertown, to study at Williams College. After graduating in 1799 with high marks in natural philosophy, he married the daughter of Malachi and Mary (née McCall) Thomas in October the same year, who died in 1802, leaving him a son. He arranged to study in the legal profession, studying law with the Hon. Elisha Williams, of Spencertown, and the Hon. Josiah Ogden, of New York, receiving admittance to the bar of the Supreme Court of New York. An association that he formed in New York with Dr. David Hosack and Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, marked another determining point in his career; for, under their instruction, Eaton, became committed to the natural sciences, and in particular botany. Eaton practiced as a lawyer and as a land agent in Catskill, New York until 1810, when he was jailed on charges of forgery, spending nearly five years in prison. On his release in 1815, Eaton removed to New Haven at Yale College to take up the study of botany, chemistry and mineralogy under the tuition of Benjamin Silliman and Eli Ives. He then returned to Williams College to offer a course of lectures and volunteer classes of the students on botany, mineralogy zoology, and geology and published a botanical dictionary. In 1817, he published his \"Manual of Botany for the Northern States\", the first comprehensive flora of the area; it ultimately went through eight editions. From Williams College the lectures were extended, in the shape of courses, with practical instructions to classes, to the larger towns of New England and New York.\\n\\nHe returned to New York State in 1818 to Albany on DeWitt Clinton\\'s preparations for him to deliver a series of lectures to the New York State Legislature on the state\\'s geology in connection with the building of the Erie Canal and agriculture. Among the legislators who heard these lectures was Stephen Van Rensselaer III, patroon of Rensselaerswyck, who, in 1820, hired him to produce \"A geological Survey of the County of Albany\", which was followed by geological surveys of much of the area through which the canal was built. Ultimately, Eaton would complete a survey of a section fifty miles wide from Buffalo to Boston.\\n\\nEaton delivered talks at the Lenox Academy and the Medical College at Castleton, Vermont, where he was appointed professor of natural history in 1820. He gave lectures and practical instructions in Troy, laying the foundation as a result of his work, of the Lyceum of Natural History. In 1820 and 1821, Eaton initiated geological and agricultural surveys of Albany and Rensselaer counties at the expense of Van Rensselaer. Eaton\\'s efforts led Troy as a depository of an extensive collection of geological specimens and comprehensive land surveys.\\n\\nSection::::Rensselaer School.\\nAfter co-founding the Rensselaer School in 1824, Van Rensselaer appointed Eaton to teach chemistry, experimental philosophy, geology, surveying, and the \"laws regulating town officers and jurors.\" By then Eaton was a well established public speaker on natural philosophy, touring and delivering lectures in the northeast. He was also a recognized pioneer in botany and principal land surveyor in the country. Eaton immediately set about to develop a new kind of institution devoted to the application of science to life, to a modern scientific prospectus, to new methods of instruction and examination, to recognize women in higher education a possibility, and to be practical in training for adults. Eaton\\'s original aim was to also train teachers and disciples, which he did in large numbers. Students learned by doing, in sharp contrast with the conventional method of learning by rote. Students were made into experimenters and workers, and, in place of recitations, delivered lectures to one another. Eaton also often led day excursions, taking students to observe the application of science on nearby farms and in workshops, tanneries, and bleaching factories. They then returned to the laboratory, analyzing the principles involved. This, too, was an innovation, as it represented a reversal of the usual pedagogical method, which began with the principle and proceeded to the application. Eaton\\'s principal focus was the training of students to teach science and its applications to the New York farming community via experimental demonstrations, a goal in keeping with Britain\\'s mechanics\\' institutes and lyceum movements on diffusing useful knowledge. As a result, Eaton\\'s system of instruction posed a challenge, if not a threat, to the traditional liberal-arts colleges, causing them to expand their own curricula and set up departments or schools of engineering and science. Formal engineering education would not be added at Rensselaer until 1828. After becoming professor of natural history at Harvard University in 1842, Asa Gray required some practical work of all of his students in botany along the lines established by Amos Eaton. Under his leadership, Troy, New York rivaled London, England as a center for geological studies in the first part of the 19th century.\\n\\nEaton was interested in education for women, he had lectured them on his tour of New England, and he was persuaded that their failure in science was caused by inferior opportunity, not \"perversion of female genius.\" Eaton, clearly hoped to educate females at the school. He believed that women were capable of learning practical science and mathematics; they simply had not been taught the subjects at traditional female academies. His commitment to the cause led Eaton to enroll a class of eight young women in a special mathematics course to show that they could advance beyond \"the speculative geometry and algebra as generally practiced in female seminaries.\" When the students completed their course of study in 1835, Eaton requested a review of their progress by the school\\'s less-than-enthusiastic board of examiners. The eight young ladies who participated in Eaton\\'s experiment continued their education at the Troy Female Seminary. Eaton trained a bevy of future, notable, scientists and lectured to countless later educationists.\\n\\nToday Amos Eaton Hall houses the mathematics department, and the Amos Eaton Professorship is a faculty endowment named at the institute. The Amos Eaton Chair was originally given by students to Amos Eaton in 1839, but was later returned to the institute by the Eaton family.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nFollowing the death of his first wife, Polly Thomas, Eaton was remarried to Sally Cady in 1803, who bore him five sons. After her death he was remarried to Anna Bradley in 1816, by whom he had three sons and two daughters. She having died, Eaton married Alice Johnson in 1827, who bore him one son, and survived him about four years. Three of his children showed a preference for natural philosophy. Hezekiah Hulbert Eaton (1809-1832) became a chemist at Transylvania University but died at the age of twenty-three. Major General Amos Beebe Eaton (1806-1877) was a U.S. Army officer interested in natural philosophy. Sara Cady Eaton (1818-1881) taught natural sciences and modern languages in a young woman\\'s seminary at Monticello, Illinois. Eaton\\'s grandson, Daniel Cady Eaton (1834-1895), professed botany at Yale College in the 1860s.\\n\\nSection::::Works.\\nAmos Eaton published on agriculture, botany, engineering, geology, surveying, and zoology. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Amos Eaton', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1108089'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'PhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11081302', 'text': 'San Francisco Fog (soccer)\\n\\nThe San Francisco Fog was a Major Indoor Soccer League franchise which existed for only one season, 1980–1981.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Fog, which played their home games at the Cow Palace, finished their single season of existence at 11–29.

It was effectively replaced in 1951 with the launch of Ford UK\\'s Zephyr Six and Consul models, though V8 Pilots were still offered for sale, being gradually withdrawn during that year. In its production run 22,155 cars were made.\\n\\nSection::::Engine and running gear.\\nThe Pilot was the first large post-war British Ford. It was based on the pre-war 22 bhp Model 62 chassis, and was initially offered in 1946 with the 2227\\xa0cc side-valve V8 60 engine from the 1939 model. . This engine was totally inadequate for the vehicle size and was quickly replaced by the E71A Dagenham 30hp engine: \\'Enfo\\' (English Ford) Dagenham cast their own version of the US 1937 Model 78, 21 stud, 30 indicated hp, 221 cubic inch/3.6 litre block and probably all ancillaries, most of which had ENFO part numbers. This was the E71A engine. which has many differences to the US 1937 engine such as; the block had one frost plug at rear on each side, just below the heads, the heads had the firing order cast in, the crankshaft had a long snout allowing double pulley fan belts for trucks, Big End bearings were flanged 1/4 shells (4 per journal), no US engine had these. The sump, on most, was also different, it had a pear shaped locating hole to accommodate the Lucas starter. Exhaust manifolds had a nice flowing design, a rare improvement on US versions.\\n\\nThe E71 30hp 3622\\xa0cc engine developed 81 hp, with a stroke of 3. 3/4\" and a bore of 3.1/16\" and fed by a single Solex carburettor. This engine, with twin sheave belt pulleys, was also used in Thames trucks.\\n\\nThe gears are changed by means of a gear lever on the steering column. The gearbox has three forward ratios and one reverse. Steering uses a form of worm and roller mechanism called a Marles steering box, which has an \"hour-glass cam and a double roller\". The car was considered rather old-fashioned even when new, but its front brakes are hydraulically operated. The rear brakes are cable-operated.\\n\\nThe Pilot was built with 6-volt Lucas electrics including the starter & generator. A twin exhaust system was standard providing a quality sound.\\n\\nThe wide stud pattern 16\" wheels were the same as 1936 to 1939 US cars. Front & rear Brake drums were ENFO made but same dimensions as the 1936 US Model 68.\\n\\nMost Pilots were four-door saloons, based on the 1935 USA Model 48, but Estate (Shooting Brake (Woody)) and pick-up versions were built, the latter for export only. The chromed brass front windscreen can be opened for ventilation, pivoted about a top hinge. Leather upholstery was standard, all interior window frame trim & the dashboard were made of Bakelite plastic. Trafficators, (indicators) were standard issue with a hydraulic four jack system optional. Production ended in 1951 when Ford replaced the Pilot with the Zephyr.\\n\\nLike other Fords of its era, the Pilot had vacuum-driven wipers powered from the engine manifold with a vacuum reservoir tank improving performance under load whereas US cars without the reservoir option tended to work much more slowly or even stop under full throttle or under load. The car was reputed to accelerate from 0 to in 21 seconds, have a top speed of , and return .\\n\\nWAR PRODUCTION of the E71A Engine. as quoted in \\'The Illustrated History Of Ford Trucks & PSVs by Michael Allen & Les Geary.

Among them was the British ship \"Eliza Russell\", the capture of which caused a diplomatic incident as Texas was seeking official recognition from the United Kingdom. When \"Brutus\" returned to Galveston to face official sanctions, Mexican ships attacked her and \"Invincible\"; both ran aground in Galveston harbor and were battered apart by storms. With the destruction of \"Brutus\", the first Texas Navy ceased to exist.\\n\\nSection::::As a private warship.\\nAt the beginning of the Texas War of Independence, businessmen John and Augustus Allen endeavored to keep the Texans\\' supply channels open. At their own expense, they outfitted a ship called \"Brutus\" for the purpose of protecting the Texas coast and assisting troops and supplies from the United States to arrive safely in Texas.\\n\\nIn January 1836, the Allen brothers sold \"Brutus\" to the Texas Navy, and it became the second ship in the fledgling fleet of schooners.\\n\\nSection::::In the Texas Navy.\\nCaptain William A. Hurd took command of \"Brutus\" when she was commissioned into the small Texas Navy on 25 January 1836, in New Orleans. She did not reach Texan waters again until early February 1836.\\n\\nAfter the Battle of San Jacinto, \"Brutus\" put in at New Orleans for supplies and to be refitted. Upon returning to sea duty, Brutus found herself blockaded at Matagorda by the Mexican brig \"Vencedor del Álamo\". Word was sent to Galveston and \"Invincible\", along with the private ships \"Ocean\" and \"Union\", successfully broke the blockade and Captain Hurd was able to take \"Brutus\" to New York City for repairs. This was apparently done without consulting Commodore Charles Hawkins who promptly sacked Hurd as commander upon his return from New York in April 1837.\\n\\nSection::::Yucatan campaign.\\nJames D. Boylan was appointed Captain of the \"Brutus\" and he acted with vigor. He immediately escorted the supply ship \"Texas\" from Galveston to Matagorda and returned by midnight the same day, 10 June 1837. Within an hour \"Brutus\" was back at sea on a mission to harry Mexican commercial shipping at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Before arriving on post, \"Brutus\" was ordered to join \"Invincible\" and move to the Yucatan peninsula. \"Invincible\" under the command of Commodore Hawkins, had aboard the Texas Secretary of the Navy, Samuel Rhoads Fisher. Fisher had personally witnessed the surrender of \"Independence\" at Matagorda in April 1837. Determined to show the value of the navy, Fisher took to sea with the last two ships of the Texas Navy.\\n\\n\"Brutus\" and \"Invincible\" reached the Yucatan on 8 July 1837 and sailed to Isla Mujeres, which they claimed for Texas.\\nThe ships cruised off the Yucatan coast attacking shipping and towns with abandon. By 16 July, the two Texas schooners made prizes of the \"Union\", the \"Telégrafo\", and the \"Adventure\" off Sisal and on 26 July they engaged the batteries defending Campeche\\'s harbor. Describing the attack on that city, Tom Wells writes, \"Continuing up the Yucatan coast, the expedition boarded ships and landed shore parties until finally they were attacked by a cavalry force and driven back to their ships. The Texans burned two villages in reprisal, then tried to force Campeche to pay $25,000 in tribute. However, the city was surrounded by heavy stone walls and was well-fortified. After an inconclusive three-hour exchange of gunfire, the two ships departed.\" After the unsuccessful attempt to extort money from Campeche, the tiny flotilla sailed north and captured the \"Obispo\" and the British vessel \"Eliza Russell\" off the Alacranes and then doubled back down the Yucatan coast and then, on 12 August, captured the \"Correo de Tabasco\". The seizure of the \"Eliza Russell\" proved to be a diplomatic incident of some note, almost resulting in the United Kingdom\\'s refusal to recognize the Republic of Texas. The ships, running low on water, started back to Galveston, but not before \"Brutus\" captured \"Rafaelita\" on 17 August and blockaded Matamoros.\\n\\nSection::::Final struggle.\\nOn 27 August 1837, both ships arrived in Galveston and \"Brutus\" crossed the sandbar and entered Galveston harbor. \"Invincible\" delayed and was caught by two Mexican brigs of war, the \"Iturbide\" and \"Libertador\". \"Brutus\" made ready to join \"Invincible\" in the battle but she ran aground on a sandbar. \"Invincible\" also ran aground and was destroyed by the breakers. \"Brutus\" survived but would never be floated again.

The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. Somewhat similar in texture to European pancakes crossed with a popover or Yorkshire pudding, æbleskiver are solid like a pancake but light and fluffy like a popover. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver.\\n\\nSection::::Æbleskiver pan.\\nÆbleskiver are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron, allowing good heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.\\n\\nSection::::Preparation.\\nThe batter for æbleskiver usually includes wheat flour, which is mixed with buttermilk, milk or cream, eggs, sugar and a pinch of salt. Some recipes also include fat (usually butter), cardamom and lemon zest to improve taste, and a leavening agent, most often baking powder, but sometimes yeast, to aerate the batter.\\n\\nBatter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the æbleskiver begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. They were traditionally cooked with bits of apple (\"æble\") or applesauce inside but these ingredients are very rarely included in modern Danish forms of the dish. Æbleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, black currant or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\\n\\nÆbleskiver can be bought fried and frozen at supermarkets, only needing heating in an oven.\\n\\nSection::::Traditions.\\nIn Denmark æbleskiver are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gløgg, Scandinavian mulled wine. They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children\\'s birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.\\n\\nIn North America there are several annual events that celebrate æbleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding \"Æbleskiver Suppers\" and similar events.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Æbleskiver', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1108917'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'QxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1109076', 'text': 'Youth of the Progress Party\\n\\nYouth of the Progress Party () is the youth wing of the Progress Party of Denmark.\\n', 'title': 'Youth of the Progress Party', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1109076'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11091644', 'text': 'Spokane (horse)\\n\\nSpokane was a chestnut Thoroughbred stallion foaled in 1886.

He scored Canada's first and only goal from a header in a 1–0 win against Cuba in Havana, during the opening match of the semi-final round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. On February 11, 2013 FIFA ruled that Occéan had committed an act of unsporting conduct, displayed several acts of unsporting behavior, and used offensive language towards match officials during a 2014 World Cup qualifying match against Cuba on October 12, 2012. As part of the ruling, Occéan received a 6-match suspension. It was later determined that only Canada's official competitive matches, not friendlies, count toward the suspension meaning that the earliest that Occéan would be available for selection would be the final of the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, if Canada were to advance that far in the tournament.\\n\\nSection::::Honours.\\nSection::::Norway.\\nLillestrøm SK\\n\\nSection::::Germany.\\nSpVgg Greuther Fürth\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Olivier Occéan', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1109407'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11094380', 'text': 'Enzootic\\n\\nEnzootic is the non-human equivalent of endemic and means, in a broad sense, \"belonging to\" or \"native to\", \"characteristic of\", or \"prevalent in\" a particular geography, race, field, area, or environment; native to an area or scope. \\n\\nIt also has two specific meanings:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Enzootic', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11094380'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11097038', 'text': 'List of Superfund sites in Georgia (U.S. state)\\n\\nThis is a list of Superfund sites in Georgia designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.

One day she starts receiving phone calls from people thinking that she is the popular singer Tianyou. It turns out that someone has leaked 600 phone numbers of famous people to the internet and Yishu's phone number got mixed up in the bunch.\\n\\nWhile Yishu finds it annoying at first, she soon receives a text message from Xiaowen, who is the singer in an amateur rock band. He wishes to write a song for Tianyou and wants Yishu - who he thinks is Tianyou's assistant - to deliver the song to Tianyou. Tianyou is a popular singer, but hasn't had a hit number lately. While she wants to sing for the sake of art, her cruel agent cares only for money and pressures her into recording an album she does not want to record because it doesn't contain any good songs. This decision gets her into a lot of trouble and she is attacked, furthering her personal depression.\\n\\nWhile Yishu hears more of Xiaowen's song through their phone calls and text messages, Yishu is distracted from the problems she attributes to her bad luck. However, Xiaowen conceals the fact he is dying from a terminal illness, thus his desperation to finish his song and have it delivered to Tianyou. Meanwhile, Tianyou has lost interest in singing, since none of the songs she has been forced to record mean anything to her, and she contemplates suicide, a path that her agent secretly delights in because it will mean her unreleased record will sell-out after her death.\\n\\nOn the night that Tianyou is about to commit suicide, Xiaowen calls her cellphone from his hospital bed, having received the correct phone number from Yishu's efforts to find it, and sings her his song. Tianyou is inspired to continue and her career is revitalized; at her next concert, she dedicates the song Xiaowen has written to him and thanks him for saving her before singing it. Tianyou sends Yishu tickets to her concert, for one each for Yishu and Xiaowen, and Yishu invites Xiaowen, hoping to finally meet him. However, at the end of the concert, she finds Xiaowen's bandmates and learns from them that Xiaowen has already died.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'The 601st Phone Call', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11097772'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11098098', 'text': 'Summertime on Icarus\\n\\n\"Summertime on Icarus\" is a science fiction short story by British writer Arthur\\xa0C.

Other sources claim she was from Rome, Jerusalem or Gaul (modern France). According to legend, she performed miraculous healings and converted the Georgian queen, Nana, and eventually the pagan king Mirian III of Iberia, who, lost in darkness and blinded on a hunting trip, found his way only after he prayed to \"Nino’s God\". Mirian declared Christianity the official religion (c. 327) and Nino continued her missionary activities among Georgians until her death.\\n\\nHer tomb is still shown at the Bodbe Monastery in Kakheti, eastern Georgia. St. Nino has become one of the most venerated saints of the Georgian Orthodox Church and her attribute, a grapevine cross, is a symbol of Georgian Christianity.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nMany sources agree that Nino was born in the small town of Colastri, in the Roman province of Cappadocia, although a smaller number of sources disagree with this. On her family and origin, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have different traditions.\\n\\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, she was the only child of a famous family. Her father was Roman general Zabulon and her mother Sosana (Susan). On her father\\'s side, Nino was related to St. George, and on her mother\\'s, to the patriarch of Jerusalem, Houbnal I.\\n\\nDuring her childhood, Nino was brought up by the nun Niofora-Sarah of Bethlehem. Nino’s uncle, who was the patriarch of Jerusalem, oversaw her traditional upbringing. Nino went to Rome with the help of her uncle where she decided to preach the Christian gospel in Iberia, known to her as the resting place of Christ’s tunic. According to the legend, Nino received a vision where the Virgin Mary gave her a grapevine cross and said:\\n\\nSaint Nino entered the Iberian Kingdom in Caucasus from the Kingdom of Armenia, where she escaped persecution at the hands of the Armenian King Tiridates III. She had belonged to a community of virgins numbering 35, along with martyr Hripsime, under the leadership of St. Gayane, who preached Christianity in the Armenian Kingdom. They were all, with the exception of Nino, tortured and beheaded by Tiridates. All 35 of the virgins were soon canonised by the Armenian Apostolic Church, including Nino (as St. Nune).\\n\\nContrasting with this, the Roman Catholic tradition, as narrated by Rufinus of Aquileia, says Nino was brought to Iberia not by her own will, but as a slave, and that her family tree is obscure.\\n\\nSection::::St Nino in Iberia.\\nNino reached the borders of the ancient Georgian Kingdom of Iberia from the south about 320. There she placed a Christian cross in the small town of Akhalkalaki and started preaching the Christian faith in Urbnisi, finally reaching Mtskheta (the capital of Iberia). The Iberian Kingdom had been influenced by the neighbouring Persian Empire which played an important role as the regional power in the Caucasus. The Iberian King Mirian III and his nation worshiped the syncretic gods Armazi and Zaden. Soon after the arrival of Nino in Mtskheta, Nana, the Queen of Iberia requested an audience with the Cappadocian.\\n\\nQueen Nana, who suffered from a severe illness, had some knowledge of Christianity but had not yet converted to it. Nino, restoring the Queen\\'s health, won to herself disciples from the Queen\\'s attendants, including a Jewish priest and his daughter, Abiathar and Sidonia. Nana also officially converted to Christianity and was baptized by Nino herself. Mirian, aware of his wife’s religious conversion, was intolerant of her new faith, persecuting it and threatening to divorce his wife if she did not leave the faith. He secluded himself, however, from Nino and the growing Christian community in his kingdom. His isolation to Christianity did not last long because, according to the legend, while on a hunting trip, he was suddenly struck blind as total darkness emerged in the woods. In a desperate state, King Mirian uttered a prayer to the God of St Nino:\\n\\nAs soon as he finished his prayer, light appeared and the king hastily returned to his palace in Mtskheta. As a result of this miracle, the King of Iberia renounced idolatry under the teaching of St Nino and was baptized as the first Christian King of Iberia. Soon, the whole of his household and the inhabitants of Mtskheta adopted Christianity. In 326 King Mirian made Christianity the state religion of his kingdom, making Iberia the second Christian state after Armenia.\\n\\nAfter adopting Christianity, Mirian sent an ambassador to Byzantium, asking Emperor Constantine I to have a bishop and priests sent to Iberia. Constantine, having learned of Iberia’s conversion to Christianity, granted Mirian the new church land in Jerusalem and sent a delegation of bishops to the court of the Georgian King. Roman historian Tyrannius Rufinus in \"Historia Ecclesiastica\" writes about Mirian\\'s request to Constantine:\\n\\nIn 334, Mirian commissioned the building of the first Christian church in Iberia which was finally completed in 379 on the spot where now stands the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta.\\nNino, having witnessed the conversion of Iberia to Christianity, withdrew to the mountain pass in Bodbe, Kakheti. St Nino died soon after; immediately after her death, King Mirian commenced with the building of monastery in Bodbe, where her tomb can still be seen in the churchyard.\\n\\nNino and its variants remains the most popular name for women and girls in the Republic of Georgia. There are currently 88,441 women over age 16 by that name residing in the country, according to the Georgia Ministry of Justice. It also continues to be a popular name for baby girls.\\n\\nThe Georgian name \"Nino\" is \"Nune\" or \"Nuneh\" in Armenian, thus St. Nino is known as St. Nune in Armenia. Her history as the only one of the 35 nuns of the company of Sts. Gayane and Hripsime to escape the slaughter at the hands of the pagan Armenian King Tiradates III in 301 is recounted in the book \"The History of the Armenians\" by Movses Khorenatzi (Moses of Khoren), which was written about the year 440.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nThe Sacred Monastery of Saint Nina is the home of a monastic community of Orthodox Christian nuns in the Patriarchate of Georgia.

With over 7,000 items and more than 10,000 individual fragments, the Collection is by far the largest collection of papyrus in the country, and offers a glimpse into the everyday life and language of the ancient world. Of keen interest to historians, linguists, classicists, philosophers, archaeologists, as well as others, the collection includes biblical fragments, religious writings, public and private documents, private letters, and writings on astronomy, astrology, mathematics, and magic. The papyri span nearly two millennia of history, dating from about 1000 BC to AD 1000, with the majority dating from the third century BC to the seventh century AD.\\n\\nMany of the papyri in U-M\\'s collection were written by Greek-speaking people living in Egypt. Their use of common Greek, known as koine, is instructive as to how the ancient dialects gave way to a more standardized language. Although most examples of papyrus originate from Egypt, papyrologists generally study documents which are written in Greek—the official language of the government from the time of Alexander the Great until the Muslim conquest of Egypt.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Michigan Papyrus Collection was initially developed by Professor Francis W. Kelsey, Chairman of the Department of Latin from 1889 to 1927. While in Italy in 1915, Professor Kelsey learned of the possibility of purchasing papyri from dealers. But, since World War I was in progress, any purchasing had to wait until after the armistice of 1918. Kelsey then traveled to Egypt to acquire papyri. In February 1920, he arrived in Cairo and secured the codex of the Minor Prophets, among many other pieces. Dr. W.W. Bishop, University Librarian of the University of Michigan, was very eager to enlarge the Library\\'s manuscript resources, and assumed responsibility for the housing and care of the papyri, as well as for providing in the Library a work room for those entrusted with their decipherment and publication. \\n\\nAll these papyrus documents provide a unique insight into the ancient world, the social structure of ancient life in general and in detail. The contribution of the papyrus collection has been very important in the understanding of the history of Egypt under Greek and Roman rule, the structure of the society from the Ptolemaic to the Byzantine period, the administration, the personal religious beliefs of individuals, the official religions and their dogmatic clashes, the history of ancient scholarship, the schools, higher education and changes in literary taste over the periods mentioned. Among the most intriguing texts to have been unearthed are passages from sorcerers\\' handbooks that disclose magic spells and give instructions on their proper use.\\n\\nThe collection of papyri is augmented by the University\\'s collection of ostraca, which is housed in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. Other ancient materials in the Collection include wood and wax tablets (unique in the ancient world because they were eraseable and re-usable).\\n\\nSection::::Professional Activities and Affiliations.\\nFrom July 29-August 4, 2007, The U-M Papyrus Collection hosted the XXV International Congress of Papyrology. The Congress is an important gathering of international scholars and researchers.\\n\\nThe U-M Papyrus Collection also produces the \"Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists\", the only professional journal published in America for the advanced study of papyri and related topics.\\n\\nSection::::Digitization efforts.\\nThe University of Michigan Papyrus Collection has for many years been involved in digitizing its papyrology collection. New technology has aided the study of the fragile materials, making it more easily accessible. The first digital scanner purchased by the U-M Library was used to begin digitizing its papyrus holdings, according to the Winter 2007 issue of \"Search and Discovery: Research at Michigan\".\\n\\nThe University of Michigan, along with UC Berkeley, Columbia, Duke, Princeton, and Yale, is a member of the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS), a consortium that is working to digitize the member institutions\\' collections and make them available online. The Michigan APIS database currently has over 35,000 records with images, searchable in a variety of fields including date, language, origin, type of text, author, names of persons, and many more.

In general, a forceps birth is likely to be safer for both the mother and baby than the alternatives — either a ventouse birth or a caesarean section — although caveats such as operator skill apply.\\n\\nAdvantages of forceps use include avoidance of caesarean section (and the short and long-term complications that accompany this), reduction of delivery time, and general applicability with cephalic presentation (head presentation). Common complications include the possibility of bruising the baby and causing more severe tears than would otherwise be the case (although it is important to recognise that almost all women will sustain some form of tear when delivering their first baby). Severe and rare complications (occurring less frequently than 1 in 200) include nerve damage, Descemet\\'s membrane rupture, skull fractures, and cervical cord injury.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nObstetric forceps consist of two branches (blades) that are positioned around the head of the fetus. These branches are defined as left and right depending on which side of the mother\\'s pelvis they will be applied. The branches usually, but not always, cross at a midpoint, which is called the articulation. Most forceps have a locking mechanism at the articulation, but a few have a sliding mechanism instead that allows the two branches to slide along each other. Forceps with a fixed lock mechanism are used for deliveries where little or no rotation is required, as when the fetal head is in line with the mother\\'s pelvis. Forceps with a sliding lock mechanism are used for deliveries requiring more rotation.\\n\\nThe blade of each forceps branch is the curved portion that is used to grasp the fetal head. The forceps should surround the fetal head firmly, but not tightly. The blade characteristically has two curves, the cephalic and the pelvic curves. The cephalic curve is shaped to conform to the fetal head. The cephalic curve can be rounded or rather elongated depending on the shape of the fetal head. The pelvic curve is shaped to conform to the birth canal and helps direct the force of the traction under the pubic bone. Forceps used for rotation of the fetal head should have almost no pelvic curve.\\n\\nThe handles are connected to the blades by shanks of variable lengths. Forceps with longer shanks are used if rotation is being considered.\\n\\nSection::::Anglo-American types.\\nAll American forceps are derived from French forceps (long forceps) or English forceps (short forceps). Short forceps are applied on the fetal head already descended significantly in the maternal pelvis (i.e., proximal to the vagina). Long forceps are able to reach a fetal head still in the middle or even in the upper part of the maternal pelvis. At present practice, it is uncommon to use forceps to access a fetal head in the upper pelvis. So, short forceps are preferred in the UK and USA. Long forceps are still in use elsewhere.\\n\\n\"Simpson forceps\" (1848) are the most commonly used among the types of forceps and has an elongated cephalic curve. These are used when there is substantial molding, that is, temporary elongation of the fetal head as it moves through the birth canal.\\n\\n\"Elliot forceps\" (1860) are similar to Simpson forceps but with an adjustable pin in the end of the handles which can be drawn out as a means of regulating the lateral pressure on the handles when the instrument is positioned for use. They are used most often with women who have had at least one previous vaginal delivery because the muscles and ligaments of the birth canal provide less resistance during second and subsequent deliveries. In these cases the fetal head may thus remain rounder.\\n\\n\"Kielland forceps\" (1915, Norwegian) are distinguished by having no angle between the shanks and the blades and a sliding lock. The pelvic curve of the blades is identical to all other forceps. The common misperception that there is no pelvic curve has become so entrenched in the obstetric literature that it may never be able to be overcome, but it can be proved by holding a blade of Kielland\\'s against any other forceps of one\\'s choice. Kielland forceps are probably the most common forceps used for rotation. The sliding mechanism at the articulation can be helpful in asynclitic births (when the fetal head is tilted to the side) since it is no longer in line with the birth canal. Because the handles, shanks, and blades are all in the same plane the forceps can be applied in any position to affect rotation. Because the shanks and handles are not angled, the forceps cannot be applied to a high station as readily as those with the angle since the shanks impinge on the perineum.\\n\\n\"Wrigley\\'s forceps\" are used in \"low\" or \"outlet deliveries\" (see explanations below), when the maximum diameter is about above the vulva. Wrigley\\'s forceps were designed for use by general practitioner obstetricians, having the safety feature of an inability to reach high into the pelvis. Obstetricians now use these forceps most commonly in cesarean section delivery where manual traction is proving difficult. The short length results in a lower chance of uterine rupture.\\n\\n\"Piper\\'s forceps\" has a perineal curve to allow application to the after-coming head in breech delivery.\\n\\nSection::::Technique.\\nThe cervix must be fully dilated and retracted and the membranes ruptured. The urinary bladder should be empty, perhaps with the use of a catheter. High forceps are never indicated in the modern era. Mid forceps can occasionally be indicated but require operator skill and caution. The station of the head must be at the level of the ischial spines. The woman is placed on her back, usually with the aid of stirrups or assistants to support her legs. A regional anaesthetic (usually either a spinal, epidural or pudendal block) is used to help the mother remain comfortable during the birth. Ascertaining the precise position of the fetal head is paramount, and though historically was accomplished by feeling the fetal skull suture lines and fontanelles, in the modern era, confirmation with ultrasound is essentially mandatory. At this point, the two blades of the forceps are individually inserted, the left blade first for the commonest occipito-anterior position; posterior blade first if a transverse position, then locked. The position on the baby\\'s head is checked. The fetal head is then rotated to the occiput anterior position if it is not already in that position. An episiotomy may be performed if necessary. The baby is then delivered with gentle (maximum 30\\xa0lb or 130 Newton) traction in the axis of the pelvis.\\n\\nSection::::Outlet, low, mid or high.\\nThe accepted clinical standard classification system for forceps deliveries according to station and rotation was developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and consists of:\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe obstetric forceps were invented by the eldest son of the Chamberlen family of surgeons. The Chamberlens were French Huguenots from Normandy who worked in Paris before they migrated to England in 1569 to escape the religious violence in France. William Chamberlen, the patriarch of the family, was most likely a surgeon; he had two sons, both named Pierre, who became maverick surgeons and specialists in midwifery. William and the eldest son practiced in Southampton and then settled in London. The inventor was probably the eldest Peter Chamberlen the elder, who became obstetrician-surgeon of Queen Henriette, wife of King Charles I of England and daughter of Henry IV, King of France. He was succeeded by his nephew, Dr. Peter Chamberlen (barbers-surgeons were not Doctors in the sense of physician), as royal obstetrician. The success of this dynasty of obstetricians with the Royal family and high nobles was related in part to the use of this \"secret\" instrument allowing delivery of a live child in difficult cases.\\nIn fact, the instrument was kept secret for 150 years by the Chamberlen family, although there is evidence for its presence as far back as 1634. Hugh Chamberlen the elder, grandnephew of Peter the eldest, tried to sell the instrument in Paris in 1670, but the demonstration he performed in front of François Mauriceau, responsible for Paris Hotel-Dieu maternity, was a failure which resulted in the death of mother and child. The secret may have been sold by Hugh Chamberlen to Dutch obstetricians at the start of the 18th century in Amsterdam, but there are doubts about the authenticity of what was actually provided to buyers.\\n\\nThe forceps were used most notably in difficult childbirths. The forceps could avoid some infant deaths when previous approaches (involving hooks and other instruments) extracted them in parts. In the interest of secrecy, the forceps were carried into the birthing room in a lined box and would only be used once everyone was out of the room and the mother blindfolded.\\n\\nModels derived from the Chamberlen instrument finally appeared gradually in England and Scotland in 1735. About 100 years after the invention of the forceps by Peter Chamberlen Sr. a surgeon by the name of Jean Palfyn presented his obstetric forceps to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1723. They contained parallel blades and were called the Hands of Palfyn.\\n\\nThese \"hands\" were possibly the instruments described and used in Paris by Gregoire father and son, Dussée, and Jacques Mesnard. \\n\\nIn 1813, Peter Chamberlen’s midwifery tools were discovered at Woodham Mortimer Hall near Maldon (UK) in the attic of the house. The instruments were found along with gloves, old coins and trinkets. The tools discovered also contained a pair of forceps that were assumed to have been invented by the father of Peter Chamberlen because of the nature of the design.\\n\\nThe Chamberlen family\\'s forceps were based on the idea of separating the two branches of \"sugar clamp\" (as those used to remove \"stones\" from bladder), which were put in place one after another in the birth canal. This was not possible with conventional tweezers previously tested. However, they could only succeed in a maternal pelvis of normal dimensions and on fetal heads already well engaged (i.e. well lowered into maternal pelvis). Abnormalities of pelvis were much more common in the past than today, which complicated the use of Chamberlen forceps. The absence of pelvic curvature of the branches (vertical curvature to accommodate the anatomical curvature of maternal sacrum) prohibited blades from reaching the upper-part of the pelvis and exercising traction in the natural axis of pelvic excavation.\\n\\nIn 1747, French obstetrician Andre Levret, published \"Observations sur les causes et accidents de plusieurs accouchements laborieux\" (\"Observations on the Causes and Accidents of Several difficult Deliveries\"), in which he described his modification of the instrument to follow the \"curvature\" of the maternal pelvis, this \"pelvic curve\" allowing a grip on a fetal head \"still high\" in the pelvic excavation, which could assist in more difficult cases.\\n\\nThis improvement was published in 1751 in England by William Smellie in the book \"A Treatise on the theory and practice of midwifery\". After this fundamental improvement, the forceps would become a common obstetrical instrument for more than two centuries.\\n\\nThe last improvement of the instrument was added in 1877 by a French obstetrician, Stephan Tarnier in \"descriptions of two new forceps.\" This instrument featured a \"traction system\" misaligned with the instrument itself, sometimes called the \"third curvature of the forceps\". This particularly ingenious traction system, allowed the forceps to exercise traction on the head of the child following \"the axis of the maternal pelvic excavation\", which had never been possible before.\\n\\nTarnier\\'s idea was to \"split\" mechanically the grabbing of the fetal head (between the forceps blades) on which the operator does not intervene after their correct positioning, from a mechanical accessory set on the forceps itself, the \"tractor\" on which the operator exercises traction needed to pull down the fetal head in the correct axis of the pelvic excavation. Tarnier forceps (and its multiple derivatives under other names) remained the most widely used system in the world until the development of the cesarean section.\\n\\nForceps had a profound influence on obstetrics as it allowed for the speedy delivery of the baby in cases of difficult or obstructed labour. Over the course of the 19th Century, many practitioners attempted to redesign the forceps, so much so that the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists\\' collection has several hundred examples. In the last decades, however, with the ability to perform a cesarean section relatively safely, and the introduction of the ventouse or vacuum extractor, the use of forceps and training in the technique of its use has sharply declined.\\n\\nSection::::Historical role in the medicalisation of childbirth.\\nThe introduction of the obstetrical forceps provided huge advances in the medicalisation of childbirth. Before the eighteenth century, childbirth was thought of as a medical phase that could be overseen by a female relative. Usually if a doctor had to get involved that meant something had gone wrong. Around this era, (eighteenth century) there were no female doctors. Since males were only exclusively called in under extreme circumstances, the act of childbirth was thought to better known to a midwife or female relative rather than a male doctor. Usually the male doctor’s job was to save the mother’s life if, for example, the baby had become stuck on his or her way exiting the mother. Before the obstetrical forceps, this had to be done by cutting the baby out piece by piece. In other cases, if the baby was deemed undeliverable, then the doctor would use an item called a crochet. This was used to crush the baby’s skull allowing the baby to be pulled out of the mother’s womb. Still in other cases, a caesarean section (c section) could be performed, but this would almost always result in the mother’s death. \"In addition, women who had forceps deliveries had shorter after childbirth complications than those who had caesarean sections performed.\" These procedures came with various risks to the mother’s health along with the death of the baby. However, with the introduction of the obstetrical forceps the male doctor had a more important role. In many cases, they could actually save the baby’s life if called early enough. Although the use of the forceps in childbirth came with its own set of risks, the positives included a significant decrease in risk to the mother, a decrease in child morbidity, and a decrease risk to the baby. The forceps gave male doctors a way to deliver babies. Since the forceps in childbirth were made public around 1720, they gave male doctors a way to assist and even oversee childbirths. Around this time, in large cities some notable being London and Paris, some men would become devoted to obstetrical practices. It became stylish among wealthy women of the era to have their childbirth overseen by male midwives. A notable male midwife was William Hunter. He popularised obstetrics. \"In 1762, he was appointed as obstetrician to Queen Charlotte.\" In addition, with the use of forceps, male doctors invented lying in hospitals to provide safe, somewhat advanced obstetrical care because of the use of the obstetrical forceps.\\n\\nSection::::Historical complications.\\nChild birth was not considered a medical practice before the eighteenth century. It was mostly overseen by a midwife, mother, stepmother, neighbor, or any female relative. \"Around the 19th and 20th Century, childbirth was considered dangerous for women.\" With the introduction of obstetrical forceps, this allowed non-medical professionals, such as the aforementioned individuals, to continue to oversee childbirths. In addition, this gave some of the public more comfort in trusting childbirth oversight to common people. However, the introduction of obstetrical forceps also had a negative effect, because there was no medical oversight of childbirth by any kind of medical professional, this exposed the practice to unnecessary risks and complications for the fetus and mother. These risks could range from minimal effects to lifetime consequences for both individuals. The baby could develop cuts and bruises in various body parts due to the forcible squeezing of his or her body through the mother’s vagina. In addition, there could be bruising on the baby’s face if the forceps\\' handler were to squeeze too tight. In some extreme cases, this could cause temporary or permanent facial nerve injury. Furthermore, if the forceps\\' handler were to twist his or her wrist while the grip was on the baby’s head, this would twist the baby’s neck and cause damage to a cranial nerve, resulting in strabismus. In rare cases, a clavicle fracture to the baby could occur. The addition of obstetrical forceps came with complication to the mother during and after childbirth. The use of the forceps gave rise to an increased risk in cuts and lacerations along the vaginal wall. This, in turn, would cause an increase in post-operative recovery time and increase the pain experienced by the mother. In addition, the use of forceps could cause more difficulty evacuating during the recovery time as compared to a mother who did not use the forceps. While some of these risks and complications were very common, in general, many people overlooked them and continued to use them.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Obstetrical forceps', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11101049'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'UBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11102373', 'text': 'Hōrin-ji\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hōrin-ji', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11102373'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'URhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11105423', 'text': 'Gelenkhüü\\n\\nGelenkhüü (, 1877–1938), full name Khainzangiin Gelenkhüü (\"Хайнзангийн Гэлэнхүү\"), also known as Gelenkhüü Shükherch (\"Гэлэнхүү Шүхэрч\" - Parachute-Gelenkhüü), is a semi-legendary figure from Northern Mongolia.

C. Athavale and the late Ganpat Rao Purohit. At a very young age, he rubbed shoulders with all-time greats at the Bhatkhande College of Music, Lucknow, in the 1930s\\xa0— the first great attempt at institutionalising traditional music instruction. Jog began his training at the age of twelve and was subsequently trained by some of the finest musicians of India, like Baba Allauddin Khan and Pandit S. N. Ratanjankar. Sri Lanka's Pandith Amaradeva studied under Jog. Jog had his early training under Shri Shankar Rao Athavie, Ganpat Rao Purohit, and V. Shastry. Later he received extensive training from Dr.S.N.Ratanjankar and Ustad Allauddin Khan. Subsequently, he was trained by Vishweswar Shastry, by the renowned musician and musicologist Dr. S. N. Ratanjankar, and for a short time by the celebrated Ustad Allauddin Khan.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nJog earned a master's degree in music from Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow in 1944 and went on to teach there. He also taught at the Ali Akbar College of Music. He was a disciple of Baba Allauddin Khan. He performed and recorded with many of the greatest Hindustani musicians of the 20th century (including Bismillah Khan) and toured the world. He frequently performed for All India Radio's Calcutta division.\\n\\nHis book 'Behala Shiksha', published in 1944, is recognized as a major piece of authoritative literature on the subject. He joined All India Radio in 1953 and served as music producer. He had made successful tours to foreign countries and issued many LP and EP gramophone records of both solo performances and jugalbandi with sangeet maestros. He toured extensively both in India and abroad, significantly in East Africa, Nepal, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, France, the United States, and West Germany. In 1985, he performed to great acclaim under the auspices of the Festival of India in the United States\\n\\nHe received many honors from various cultural institutions, including the Padma Bhushan in 1983 by the president of India\\n. By the time he retired he had risen to deputy chief producer, All India Radio.\\n\\nSection::::Style.\\nTrained in the Gwalior, Agra and Bakhale gharanas, Jog evolved his own characteristic style, which was a blend of gayaki and gatkari, noted for purity of melody and tradition, a formidable layakari ability, dignity, crispness and easy musical communication. He often enlightened audiences according to their taste with lighter themes and folk tunes, flowing with lilting and sparkling grace. His virtuosity, mastery of ragas and uncanny realisation of space and time in the construction and knowledge of rhythm are his hallmarks.\\n\\nJog, whose name is almost synonymous with the violin genre in Hindustani classical music, was a performer with the unique distinction of having occupied the top rungs of the classical musicians' hierarchy with three consecutive generations of performers. His career as a highly active and successful performer spanned almost five decades. An unassuming person of infinite charm, he was also regarded as an incomparable accompanist.<nowiki> His duets with Ustad Bismillah Khan met with spectacular successes in India and abroad.

It primarily infects \"Rubus\" species.\\n\\nIt has been used in the biological control of invasive blackberry species in Chile, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2005, it was discovered growing on Himalayan blackberry plants in Oregon. This accidental introduction does not appear to be infecting native vegetation, so it offers hope for reducing the impact of invasive blackberries in the Pacific Northwest.\\n\\nSection::::Symptoms.\\nThe foliar symptoms that can be found include purple leaf spots along with yellow and tan centers. These can be found on the upper surface of the leaf and can resemble \"Septoria\" leaf spot. On the lower surface of the leaf yellow to orange pustules will be surrounded by a purple tinge. These can resemble cane and leaf rust. The leaves that are severely infected can start to dehydrate as well as start to curl. The leaves that are older and closer to the cane will get infected first and can die as well. The flowers and the fruits that are infected may fail to ripen. Stem infections as well as the continuous defoliation may cause the dieback of the canes. During the summer and fall the infected leaves can start to develop black pustules otherwise known as telia among the uredinia.\\n\\nSection::::Disease Cycle.\\nThe pathogen is a macrocyclic, autoecious rust fungus, and produces five different spore states that represent the asexual and sexual components of the life cycle. Dikaryotic urediniospores are released during the summer as well as the spring while teliospores represent the overwintering stage. When the sexual outcrossing occurs the dikaryotic aeciospores and urediniospores are initiated. The teliospores in the spring will then undergo meiosis in order to produce haploid basidiospores. This follows the insect-mediated transfer of spermatia from the spermogonia of the different types of mating to the receptive hyphae. The spores are spread very easily and can be spread by wind.\\n\\nSection::::Management.\\nCultural tactics along with dormant season lime sulfur can help to reduce the initial inoculums source. The chemical tactics function to protect the healthy younger plant tissues. By removing the old fruiting canes early, after the harvest it will prevent the spreading of the infection. Chemical controls can be effective as well. Chemical protection will need to start by applying lime sulfur to the leaves that are infected. Fungicide application during fall, in the month of September, is the most beneficial for the health of the plant. There may be development of fungal resistance if there is overuse of any single product. The fungicides are primarily protectants therefore, cannot eradicate the disease after it becomes established. The biological control works when an uncharacterized population and or a mixture of strains of a pathogen from the native range of the target weed is released in the area into which the weed is introduced. The strain F15 was released as a biological control agent in 1991 and 1992. The release of the additional strains can originate the potential to increase the genetic diversity of the population of \"P. violaceum\". The occurrence through recombination or the increase in the effective population size can in turn improve the impact of the biological control agent. Biological control agent is likely to be successful, however there is a high potential for the failure of additional strains due to the amount of inoculums involved in the pathogen strain recruitment. The amount of inoculums released is small when compared with the well adapted pathogen that exists in the population\\n\\n', 'title': 'Phragmidium violaceum', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11128241'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'XRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111311', 'text': 'Thawville, Illinois\\n\\nThawville is a village in Ridgeland Township, Iroquois County, Illinois, United States.

Since the latter are strings of numbers, one can view this as a kind of numeral system for representing \"N\", although the main utility is representing a \"k\"-combination by \"N\" rather than the other way around. Distinct numbers correspond to distinct \"k\"-combinations, and produce them in lexicographic order; moreover the numbers less than formula_1 correspond to all \"k\"-combinations of }. The correspondence does not depend on the size\\xa0\"n\" of the set that the \"k\"-combinations are taken from, so it can be interpreted as a map from N to the \"k\"-combinations taken from N; in this view the correspondence is a bijection.\\n\\nThe number \"N\" corresponding to (\"c\"...,\"c\",\"c\") is given by\\n\\nThe fact that a unique sequence so corresponds to any number \"N\" was observed by D. H. Lehmer. Indeed a greedy algorithm finds the \"k\"-combination corresponding to \"N\": take \"c\" maximal with formula_3, then take \"c\" maximal with formula_4, and so forth. Finding the number \"N\", using the formula above, from the \"k\"-combination (\"c\"...,\"c\",\"c\") is also known as \"ranking\", and the opposite operation (given by the greedy algorithm) as \"unranking\"; these operations are known by those names in most computer algebra systems, and in computational mathematics.\\n\\nThe originally used term \"combinatorial representation of integers\" is shortened to \"combinatorial number system\" by Knuth,\\nwho also gives a much older reference;\\nthe term \"combinadic\" is introduced by James McCaffrey (without reference to previous terminology or work).\\n\\nUnlike the factorial number system, the combinatorial number system of degree \"k\" is not a mixed radix system: the part formula_5 of the number \"N\" represented by a \"digit\" \"c\" is not obtained from it by simply multiplying by a place value.\\n\\nThe main application of the combinatorial number system is that it allows rapid computation of the \"k\"-combination that is at a given position in the lexicographic ordering, without having to explicitly list the \"k\"-combinations preceding it; this allows for instance random generation of \"k\"-combinations of a given set. Enumeration of \"k\"-combinations has many applications, among which software testing, sampling, quality control, and the analysis of lottery games.\\n\\nSection::::Ordering combinations.\\nA \"k\"-combination of a set \"S\" is a subset of \"S\" with \"k\" (distinct) elements. The main purpose of the combinatorial number system is to provide a representation, each by a single number, of all formula_1 possible \"k\"-combinations of a set \"S\" of \"n\" elements. Choosing, for any \"n\", } as such a set, it can be arranged that the representation of a given \"k\"-combination \"C\" is independent of the value of \"n\" (although \"n\" must of course be sufficiently large); in other words considering \"C\" as a subset of a larger set by increasing \"n\" will not change the number that represents\\xa0\"C\". Thus for the combinatorial number system one just considers \"C\" as a \"k\"-combination of the set N of all natural numbers, without explicitly mentioning \"n\".\\n\\nIn order to ensure that the numbers representing the \"k\"-combinations of } are less than those representing \"k\"-combinations not contained in }, the \"k\"-combinations must be ordered in such a way that their largest elements are compared first. The most natural ordering that has this property is lexicographic ordering of the \"decreasing\" sequence of their elements. So comparing the 5-combinations \"C\"\\xa0=\\xa0{0,3,4,6,9} and \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>\\xa0=\\xa0{0,1,3,7,9}, one has that \"C\" comes before \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>, since they have the same largest part\\xa09, but the next largest part\\xa06 of \"C\" is less than the next largest part\\xa07 of \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>; the sequences compared lexicographically are (9,6,4,3,0) and (9,7,3,1,0). Another way to describe this ordering is view combinations as describing the \"k\" raised bits in the binary representation of a number, so that \"C\"\\xa0=\\xa0{\"c\"...,\"c\"} describes the number\\n(this associates distinct numbers to \"all\" finite sets of natural numbers); then comparison of \"k\"-combinations can be done by comparing the associated binary numbers. In the example \"C\" and \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki> correspond to numbers 1001011001\\xa0=\\xa0601 and 1010001011\\xa0=\\xa0651, which again shows that \"C\" comes before \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>. This number is not however the one one wants to represent the \"k\"-combination with, since many binary numbers have a number of raised bits different from \"k\"; one wants to find the relative position of \"C\" in the ordered list of (only) \"k\"-combinations.\\n\\nSection::::Place of a combination in the ordering.\\nThe number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree \"k\" to a \"k\"-combination \"C\" is the number of \"k\"-combinations strictly less than \"C\" in the given ordering. This number can be computed from \"C\"\\xa0=\\xa0{ \"c\", ..., \"c\", \"c\"\\xa0} with \"c\"\\xa0>\\xa0...\\xa0> \"c\" > \"c\" as follows. From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each \"k\"-combination \"S\" strictly less than\\xa0\"C\", there is a unique index\\xa0\"i\" such that \"c\" is absent from \"S\", while \"c\", ..., \"c\" are present in \"S\", and no other value larger than \"c\" is. One can therefore group those \"k\"-combinations \"S\" according to the possible values 1, 2, ..., \"k\" of \"i\", and count each group separately. For a given value of \"i\" one must include\\n\"c\", ..., \"c\" in \"S\", and the remaining \"i\" elements of \"S\" must be chosen from the \"c\" non-negative integers strictly less than \"c\"; moreover any such choice will result in a \"k\"-combinations \"S\" strictly less than\\xa0\"C\". The number of possible choices is formula_5, which is therefore the number of combinations in group \"i\"; the total number of \"k\"-combinations strictly less than \"C\" then is\\nand this is the index (starting from\\xa00) of \"C\" in the ordered list of \"k\"-combinations. Obviously there is for every \"N\"\\xa0∈\\xa0N exactly one \"k\"-combination at index\\xa0\"N\" in the list (supposing \"k\"\\xa0≥\\xa01, since the list is then infinite), so the above argument proves that every \"N\" can be written in exactly one way as a sum of \"k\" binomial coefficients of the given form.\\n\\nSection::::Finding the \"k\"-combination for a given number.\\nThe given formula allows finding the place in the lexicographic ordering of a given \"k\"-combination immediately. The reverse process of finding the \"k\"-combination at a given place \"N\" requires somewhat more work, but is straightforward nonetheless. By the definition of the lexicographic ordering, two \"k\"-combinations that differ in their largest element \"c\" will be ordered according to the comparison of those largest elements, from which it follows that all combinations with a fixed value of their largest element are contiguous in the list. Moreover the smallest combination with \"c\" as largest element is formula_10, and it has \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa0\"i\"\\xa0−\\xa01 for all \"i\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"k\" (for this combination all terms in the expression except formula_10 are zero). Therefore \"c\" is the largest number such that formula_3. If \"k\"\\xa0>\\xa01 the remaining elements of the \"k\"-combination form the -combination corresponding to the number formula_13 in the combinatorial number system of degree , and can therefore be found by continuing in the same way for formula_13 and instead of \"N\" and \"k\".\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nSuppose one wants to determine the 5-combination at position 72. The successive values of formula_15 for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa04, 5, 6, ... are 0, 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, 252, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 72 is 56, for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa08. Therefore \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa08, and the remaining elements form the 4-combination at position . The successive values of formula_16 for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa03, 4, 5, ... are 0, 1, 5, 15, 35, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 16 is 15, for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa06, so \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa06. Continuing similarly to search for a 3-combination at position one finds \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa03, which uses up the final unit; this establishes formula_17, and the remaining values \"c\" will be the maximal ones with formula_18, namely . Thus we have found the 5-combination }.\\n\\nSection::::National Lottery example in Excel.\\nFor each of the formula_19 lottery combinations \"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0, there is a list number \"N\" between 0 and formula_20 which can be found by adding\\n\\nSuppose you want to find a position of a British National Lottery result 3,6,15,17,18,35 in a list of possible results. Excel function COMBIN(49,6) would show that number of results is 13983816. Now if you put numbers 3,6,15,17,18,35 each in its cell and formulas COMBIN(49-3,6), COMBIN(49-6,5), COMBIN(49-15,4), COMBIN(49-17,3), COMBIN(49-18,2), 49−35 under each of them. Use cell references instead of actual values, the actual values are provided for readability. You would get a row of numbers of 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14. Adding these would show particular position 10381232. Note that you do not need use formula COMBIN(49-35,1) to get 14. You can have it by subtraction 49-35 alone. Also the COMBIN function does not return 0 in case 49-X becomes less than 6. You\\'d need to use IF with ISNUMBER function to convert #NUM! into 0.\\n\\nNow the reverse engineering is a bit trickier. You could use 49 IF statements in one cell or use solver to find maximum argument for COMBIN result to be less or equal than position number. Instead let\\'s use a table of 6 by 49 and use MATCH function where resulting row number would be the argument and a ball number. If you make column headings from 6 to 1 (B1:G1) in descending order and row labels of 1 to 49 (A2:A50) in ascending order (vertically ascending in Excel means numbers growing from top to bottom). Then if you fill up the table with formula COMBIN($A2,B$1) starting from left top corner. $ signs will make sure that index values are always taken from heading row and label column. Replace #NUM! with zeros. You should get something like this:\\n\\nNow if you create a new row of six cells and fill them with formulas which would find the largest values in each column which are less than or equal to position number in question:\\nThe first cell with =INDEX(B2:B50,MATCH(10381232,B2:B50)), the rest of the cells with\\n\\nThis would present you with a row of values you have already seen 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14\\nNow in a next row first cell write =49-MATCH(10381232,B2:B50) and similarly\\n\\nAgain use the references to cells instead of actual values. You should be presented with original ball numbers of 3,6,15,17,18,35.\\n\\nNow you can generate a fresh Lottery number combination from single =randbetween(1,combin(49,6)) or you could look at the list position numbers of earlier results to see if there is a trend.\\n\\nSection::::Applications.\\nOne could use the combinatorial number system to list or traverse all \"k\"-combinations of a given finite set, but this is a very inefficient way to do that. Indeed, given some \"k\"-combination it is much easier to find the next combination in lexicographic ordering directly than to convert a number to a \"k\"-combination by the method indicated above. To find the next combination, find the smallest \"i\"\\xa0≥\\xa02 for which \"c\"\\xa0≥\\xa0\"c\"+2 (if there is no such \"i\", take \"i\" = \"k\"+1); then increase \"c\" by one and set all \"c\" with to their minimal value . If the \"k\"-combination is represented by its characteristic vector, that is as a binary value with \"k\" bits\\xa01, then the next such value can be computed without any loop using bitwise arithmetic: the following C++ function will advance x to that value or return false:\\n\\n// find next k-combination\\nbool next_combination(unsigned long& x) // assume x has form x\\'01^a10^b in binary\\n\\nThis is called Gosper\\'s hack;\\ncorresponding assembly code was described as item 175 in HAKMEM.\\n\\nOn the other hand the possibility to directly generate the \"k\"-combination at index \"N\" has useful applications. Notably, it allows generating a random \"k\"-combination of an \"n\"-element set using a random integer \"N\" with formula_22, simply by converting that number to the corresponding \"k\"-combination. If a computer program needs to maintain a table with information about every \"k\"-combination of a given finite set, the computation of the index \"N\" associated with a combination will allow the table to be accessed without searching.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Combinatorial number system', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113115'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'XxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111313', 'text': 'Wellington, Illinois\\n\\nWellington is a village in Lovejoy Township, Iroquois County, Illinois, United States.

It governed the country from 1964 to 1991 under the socialist presidency of Kenneth Kaunda, and which was the sole legal party between 1973 and 1990.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nUNIP was founded in October 1959 by Mainza Chona as a successor of the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC), banned earlier that year. UNIP was initially led Chona as the ZANC leader, Kaunda, had been imprisoned. Kaunda later assumed power as leader of UNIP after he was released from prison in 1960.\\n\\nIn the general elections, UNIP won 14 seats, in second position, the first being taken by United Federal Party(UFP). Although Northern Rhodesian African National Congress leader Harry Nkumbula had made a secret electoral pact with the UFP, he later opted to form a government with UNIP. After a convincing victory in the Northern Rhodesian general elections in 1964, when UNIP won 55 of the 75 seats, Kaunda became Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia, leading the country to independence on 24 October 1964, when he became President.\\n\\nIn the 1968 general elections Kaunda was re-elected president with 82% of the vote, and UNIP won 81 of the 105 elected seats in the National Assembly. \\n\\nIn 1973 the country became a one-party state with UNIP as the sole legal party, with an amended constitution being promulgated on 25 August 1973. The general election that year described as the final steps in achieving what was called a \"one-party participatory democracy.\" National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of UNIP. According to the constitution, UNIP\\'s president was selected at the party\\'s general conference, and the second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP\\'s secretary general. The constitution also stipulated that UNIP\\'s president was the sole candidate for president of the republic; he was confirmed in office every five years via a yes/no referendum. Voters chose between multiple UNIP candidates for the 125 parliamentary seats, with three candidates running in each constituency. Kaunda was confirmed as president with 89% of the vote. Elections were held under the same system in 1978, 1983 and 1988, with Kaunda receiving at least 80% of the vote each time.\\n\\nAt the end of 1990 multi-party democracy was reintroduced, and UNIP was roundly defeated in the 1991 general elections by the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD); Kaunda was defeated in the presidential vote by MMD candidate Frederick Chiluba, receiving just 24% of the vote, whilst in the National Assembly elections UNIP won 25 seats to the MMD\\'s 125.\\n\\nFollowing changes to the constitution which effectively barred Kaunda from running for president again, UNIP boycotted the 1996 elections, although two members contested National Assembly seats. The party returned to contest the 2001 elections with Kenneth Kaunda\\'s son, Tilyenji, as its presidential candidate; he received 10% of the vote, finishing fourth out of the eleven candidates. In the National Assembly elections the party won 13 seats.\\n\\nPrior to the 2006 elections the party joined the United Democratic Alliance alongside the other two largest opposition parties. United Party for National Development leader Hakainde Hichilema was the alliance\\'s presidential candidate, finishing third.

Fernandez\\n\\nPando v. Fernandez, 127 Misc.2d 224 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984), is a New York case that arose when Christopher Pando, a deeply religious minor, sought to impose a constructive trust on the proceeds of a winning $2.8 million (21 annual payments; no cash option) ticket that he purchased with Dasyi Fernandez\\'s money. Pando alleged that Mrs. Fernandez agreed to share the prize money equally with him if he prayed to a saint to cause the numbers he picked for her to be the winning numbers. At the time that Pando purchased the ticket, Mrs. Fernandez was 38 and the mother of three children on welfare. Christopher Pando was 16 (too young to buy lottery tickets) and was a friend of her son. Mrs. Fernandez denied that she ever asked Pando to buy the tickets or pick the numbers, and also denied the fact that she offered to share her money with him.\\n\\nSection::::Holding.\\nThe New York Supreme Court for New York County, the trial level court in New York, held that Pando had no legally enforceable claim on the proceeds of the winning lottery ticket since it would be impossible for him to prove in court that his faith and prayers brought about a miracle that caused the defendant to win. The court granted summary judgment for the defendants.\\n\\nSection::::Plaintiff\\'s Claims.\\nPando, through his father and guardian, John Pando, claimed a breach of a partnership agreement. In his complaint, Pando stated two causes of action. The first was that he entered into an oral partnership agreement with Mrs. Fernandez, who believed that Pando was deeply religious and a strong believer in St. Eleggua, and promised that if Pando took her $4 and bought a lottery ticket and selected the numbers, that they would share any of the prize money equally. One of the tickets he bought did in fact win the jackpot, and Pando claims that Mrs. Fernandez\\'s failure to give him 50% of the money constitutes a breach of contract. The second cause of action seeks a declaratory judgment as to the rights of the parties and an imposition of a constructive trust, along with an accounting of the money already paid out and received.\\n\\nSection::::Defendant\\'s Motion to Dismiss.\\nMrs. Fernandez moved to dismiss on three grounds. First she alleged that the oral agreement was barred by the Statute of Frauds, second that the agreement called upon Pando, a minor, to do an illegal act and is unenforceable, and third that it is impossible to prove in a court of law that the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the contract had taken place.\\n\\nSection::::Court\\'s Reasoning.\\nStatute of Frauds\\n\\nAs to the defendant\\'s argument that the plaintiff\\'s claim was barred by the Statute of Frauds, the court held that the alleged agreement did not violate the Statute of Frauds, as it was able to be carried out within the one-year period for oral contracts mandated by statute in New York.\\n\\nIllegal Act\\n\\nIn addressing the defendant\\'s argument that the alleged agreement called upon Pando, who was under 18, to purchase the lottery ticket, it called for the performance of an illegal act so that enforcement of the contract by the courts would be against public policy, the court held that there was \"no pervasive requirement that the protection of public morals calls for denial of this contract.\" The court acknowledged that the law in the state of New York prohibits a person under 18 from purchasing a lottery ticket, but stated also that the law does not prohibit prizes from being paid to people under age 18.\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s Ability to Prove Contract Conditions\\n\\nThe court then addressed the question of \"whether, in a court of law, plaintiff can prove compliance with the conditions of the contract, as he has set it forth.\" The court quoted the following statement from the plaintiff\\'s affidavit:\\n\\nMrs. Fernandez, knowing that I am religious and a strong believer in St. Eleggua asked me, after noticing that the Lotto prize was several million dollars, whether or not I could get my Saint to win the Lottery. I told her that I did not know, but I would try. She thereupon told me that she would give me $4.00 to select four different tickets and that if my St. Eleggua made my selection of the Lottery numbers win, she would go equal partners with me on the prize.\\n\\nThe court stated that the condition precedent for the sharing of the prize is that Pando\\'s \"piety and prayer would cause heavenly intervention so that his selections would win,\" and then asked the question \"[h]ow can plaintiff prove on a trial that \\'St. Eleggua made my selection of Lottery numbers win?\\'\" \\n\\nThe court noted that at trial Pando would have the ability to testify to his version of what the defendant said to him, that is that he purchased the tickets, selected the numbers and that he prayed. But the court rhetorically asked \"[w]ho is going to provide the proof that his prayers were efficacious, and that the saint caused the numbers to win?\" \\n\\nThe court looked into the identity of St. Eleggua and the closest it was able to come was a saint with the Latin name of St. Eligius, the patron saint of goldsmiths, who showered his riches on the poor, and possessed the gifts of miracles and prophecy. The plaintiff was only to share in the lottery winnings if his efforts and prayers to St. Eleggua caused Fernandez to win the money. In essence, the court said, Fernandez wanted a miracle from St. Eleggua arranged by the plaintiff, so the plaintiff has the burden of proving that his prayers caused the miracle to occur.\\n\\nThis presented the court with the problem of determining whether a miracle occurred. The court summarized its problem as follows:\\n\\nHow can we really know what happened? Is a court to engage in the epistemological inquiry as to the acquisition of knowledge and belief through proof or through faith? Faith is the antithesis of proof. It is a belief which is firmly held even though demonstrable proof may be lacking. It is instructive, spiritual, and profound, arrived at not through a coldly logical appraisal of the facts but, in Wordsworth\\'s phrase, by \\'a passionate institution.\\' \\n\\nThe court held that it was impossible to prove in a court of law, which requires tangible proof, that a litigant\\'s faith and prayers brought about a miracle. The court did not discount the fact that perhaps Pando\\'s prayers did bring about a miracle, just that it was impossible to prove in a \"modern courtroom.\"\\n\\nThe court noted that in the past, under Roman law and in Medieval law, there was acceptance of the demonstration of miracles in the courtroom, but distinguished that time from the present because the function of the secular and ecclesiastical courts was not separated in the past, and there was no distinction between \"the law of the earth\" and \"the law of heaven.\" The court stated that in the modern era \"the chasm between the temporal and the spiritual world has become unbridgeable. Theology is to be protected against the law, just as the law is to be protected from theology.\"\\n\\nTherefore, the court concludes, there is no way for the plaintiff to prove that his prayer caused Fernandez to have the winning ticket. He cannot prove the existence of saints, the power of prayer, nor divine intervention in temporal affairs.\\n\\nConstructive Trust\\n\\nFinally, the court addressed the plaintiff\\'s argument that a constructive trust be imposed. The court decides that because there is no close or confidential relationship between the parties that would call for the imposition of a trust, nor would defendant be unjustly enriched if she retained the full proceeds of her winning ticket that there is no basis for the imposition of a constructive trust.\\n\\nSection::::Appellate Court Decision.\\nIn Pando v. Fernandez, 118 A.D.2d 474 (N.Y. App. Div. 1986), the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division reversed the Supreme Court\\'s decision, denying defendant\\'s motion to dismiss and reinstating the complaint, as well as granting the plaintiff\\'s cross motion to direct defendant to comply with all previously ordered discovery within 30 days of the date of the order.\\n\\nSection::::Court\\'s Holding and Reasoning.\\nThe court disagreed with the lower court\\'s holding that there was a cause to dismiss the action for impossibility of proof. The court agreed that saintly intervention is not provable in a court of law, but said it is not evident that the alleged agreement between Pando and Fernandez required such intervention as a condition of enforceability. The court bases this holding on the fact that in at least three places in the record that the lower court did not cite the plaintiff describes the agreement in terms that do not impose a condition of saintly intervention for enforcement. The court says that these versions of the agreement show only that the plaintiff was obligated to use his best efforts to enlist St. Eleggua\\'s help, and that in exchange the defendant would pay for the tickets and split any potential winnings.\\n\\nThe court said that if the defendant bargained for the plaintiff\\'s assistance and she received that assistance, she cannot disown her obligations under the agreement by imposing the additional condition that Pando prove the effectiveness of his prayers. It was possible, according to the court, that the defendant bargained simply for the benefit of the plaintiff\\'s prayers which she felt would enhance her chances of winning the lottery. Therefore, the plaintiff was required to purchase the tickets, select the numbers and pray to the Saint to fulfill his end of the bargain. The court said that none of these actions are impossible to prove in a court of law.\\n\\nThe court concluded that the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint for impossibility of proof it decided the central factual issue of the case, which was what the parties agreed to.\\n\\nJury ultimately awarded 1/2 of $2.8 million prize to Pando finding that he had entered into a legally binding contract with Ms. Fernandez.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Pando v.

Pothan. It stars Kamal Haasan, Prabhu and Amala in lead roles and Sasikala and Kushboo in supporting roles. The film was a blockbuster and completed 175-day run at the box office. It is loosely based on the novel \"The Bourne Identity\" by Robert Ludlum.\\n\\nSection::::Summary.\\nA man (Kamal Haasan) is being chased by heavily armed men in a coastline. He takes out a couple of them with his superior skills, but is shot down from a hanging ladder in the helicopter trying to rescue him. He washes up on the shores of Goa unconscious and is rescued by Shirley (Sasikala), who brings him to her doctor aunt (Sowcar Janaki).\\n\\nWhen he wakes up, he realizes that he is suffering from amnesia and has a few flashes of sculptures and a karate class, but does not recognize them. Meanwhile, the local rowdy has been harassing the doctor and her niece. The man manages to thwart their next attack easily, which makes him believe that he might be trained in martial arts. Since the man has enraged the rowdy, the doctor pleads with him to marry her niece for her own protection. He does so and thwarts another attack from the rowdy during their wedding.\\n\\nRight after, he decides to leave for Madras to find his identity with his new wife in tow. Soon they find out that the earlier flashes he had are of the sculptures in Connemara Hotel and he used to be a regular there. After getting the bank account number he has used previously in the Hotel, he visits the bank and is once again surprised to find out that he was a regular to the bank too and has a locker with a large amount of money, multiple passports of him and a hand gun.\\n\\nWhile leaving the bank, he is attacked by an unknown assailant in the lift but he once again successfully maims the assailant and escapes, but leaves a shocked witness. His bank locker contents along with his martial arts skills make him believe that he might have been involved in gangs before and decides to surrender to police but is talked out it by his wife.\\n\\nVijay (Prabhu) and Jaya (Kushboo) are part of a wedding band. The man decides to uncover another one of his image flashes and tries to locate the karate class. In one such class, the instructor recognizes him, but guides him towards a singer Disco Shanti and tells him that he might be in danger. Another group of assailants attack him, and Vijay and Jaya are caught in the chaos. Believing Vijay to be helping the man, they kidnap Jaya and demand the surrender of the man, but Vijay and the man team up to rescue Jaya, which makes Vijay pledge to help the man in his quest.\\n\\nThe man then goes to talk to the singer, but is soon recognized and is shot at. The singer helps him escape and gives him a phone number to contact but is seriously wounded. He contacts the number and barely escapes another attempt on his life, but manages to meet the person who the singer referred to, which happens to be Nithyanandam, the Deputy Inspector General of Police.\\n\\nHe finally learns of his true identity. His name is Vetrivel, and he was a happily married to Lalitha (Amala Akkineni), and was undercover IPS officer who teamed up with the DIG to bring down a notorious hit man Zinda (Salim Ghouse). Unable to find any information about Zinda\\'s whereabouts, they devise a plan to make Vetri go undercover and make him a bigger and more dangerous hit man than Zinda, hoping Zinda would get in touch with his fiercest competitor. The plan works, and soon Zinda and Vetri become friends. But soon, Zinda learns about an undercover police officer in his gang through a spy and kidnap Lalitha to oust the spy. Vetri breaks his cover to protect Lalitha, but she is shot and killed in the shooting that ensues, and Vetri is chased (the opening in the movie), but escapes barely.\\n\\nVetri puts the pieces back together and uncovers a plot by Zinda to assassinate a very popular priest, Baba Appaji (Janagaraj) when he went to visit the singer. Vijay and Vetri thwart the plot, but Zinda still manages to escape. In order to avenge this Zinda kidnaps both Vijay\\'s and Vetri\\'s wives and sends them a photographic evidence of the kidnap. But Vetri and Vijay soon find the location with the background signboard in the photo, rescue their wives, and arrest Zinda.\\n\\nAwaiting Zinda\\'s presence in the courtroom for his trial, they are surprised to see an unknown man being presented in the trial as Zinda. This makes them think that the commissioner may be the spy who swapped Zinda out and rushes to his house to confront him, but finds him murdered in the arms of his crying wife. Suspicions still exist, and Vetri and Vijay find that the real spy is the commissioner\\'s wife, and they confront her. She shows them a lot of cash and asks them to let her go. Vijay sees this, and shoots and kills Vetri for the money, and asks the wife to give him the money and leave. Believing that Vetri is finally dead, she rushes back to Zinda. But Vetri is alive, and this was a plan to make her lead them to Zinda\\'s location. Vetri and Vijay follow her to a ship docked on the port, and go in to arrest Zinda. Zinda and his men are soon overpowered by the two-man fighting machine, but before he dies, he arms a bomb in the ship. Vetri and Vijay collaborate once and successfully disarm the bomb, thus relieving the port of the threat. The movie ends with both of them shaking hands.\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nThe film is Pratap Pothen\\'s fifth directorial and third in Kollywood after \"Meendum Oru Kaathal Kathai\" and \"Jeeva\" and was loosely inspired by the novel \"The Bourne Identity\", written by Robert Ludlum in 1980. Bollywood actor Salim Ghouse made his Tamil debut with this film, portraying the antagonist. Prabhu\\'s character was not present in the novel, and was created for the film. It was dubbed in Telugu as \"Vijethalu\" and released in 1989. Prabhu Deva working as dance assistant to his father Sundaram Master choreographed a song independently for \"Vetri Vizha\".\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Soundtrack.\\nThis music and background score was composed by Illayaraja.\\n\\nSection::::Re-release.\\nA digitally restored version of the film was released in August 4, 2017.\\n', 'title': 'Vetri Vizha', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11141646'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ahhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11145524', 'text': 'Lionheart: Tussle with the Beast\\n\\nLionheart: Tussle with the Beast is the second studio album from English rapper Klashnekoff, released in 2007 on Riddim Killa Records.

The book is a biographical novel about the life of Cedric Jennings through his last years in high school and first years in college. It details his life in Ballou High School, an inner city school in Washington, D.C., and onto Brown University, which Cedric attends after high school. The book portrays the problems of inner-city education systems and how the students from these systems are affected throughout their lives. In 2008, the book was selected as part of the \"One Maryland, One Book\" program.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nCedric Jennings is an anomaly at Ballou High School in the Southeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C.: in a \\npoorly performing school where academic achievement is scorned, Cedric proudly strives for high grades with \\na desire to attend a top university. The sub-par standards at Ballou place him at a distinct disadvantage \\nacademically, while frequent taunts and physical threats from other students have alienated him socially. Cedric \\nlives with his mother, Barbara Jennings, who works for the Department of Agriculture; his father Cedric Gilliam \\nis a drug dealer currently in jail. \\nIn his junior year, Cedric is admitted to the Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES) summer \\nprogram at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He believes this is the start of a new life for him, but \\nwhen summer arrives he finds the classes much more difficult than his fellow MITES students who attended \\nbetter schools and were better versed in math and science. Although he makes friends at MIT, he also sees that his \\nghetto background sets him apart from them. At the end of the program, Cedric is told by faculty director Leon \\nTrilling that he would not be welcome in MIT as a college student.\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nAt Ballou Senior High, a school besieged by violence in Washington, D.C., honor students have learned to keep their heads down. Like most inner-city kids, they know that any special attention in a place this dangerous can make you a target of violence. But Cedric Jennings will not swallow his pride, and with unwavering support from his mother, he studies and strives as if his life depends on it—and it does. The summer after his junior year, at a program for minorities at MIT, he gets a fleeting glimpse of life outside, a glimpse that turns into a face-on challenge one year later: acceptance into Brown University, an Ivy League school.\\nAt Brown, finding himself far behind most of the other freshmen, Cedric must manage a bewildering array of intellectual and social challenges. Cedric had hoped that at college he would finally find a place to fit in, but he discovers he has little in common with either the white students, many of whom come from privileged backgrounds, or the middle-class blacks. Having traveled too far to turn back, Cedric is left to rely on his faith, his intelligence, and his determination to keep alive his hope in the unseen—a future of acceptance and reward that he struggles, each day, to envision.\\n\\nSection::::Critical Response and Reaction.\\nThe book was met with overwhelming critical and commercial success. It was chosen by the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Monthly and Booklist as one of the best books of the year. The New York Times Book Review called it “An extraordinary, formula-shattering book”. David Halberstam called it \"A beautiful book of a heroic American struggle.\" The book has been a regular selection in college courses on American culture, education, sociology and creative writing, and has been a required reading for incoming freshmen at many Universities. In 2008, the book was selected as part of the “One Maryland, One Book” program.\\n\\nThe book was especially noted for its influence on the debate over affirmative action. Upon its release in 1998, affirmative action had become one of the preeminent domestic social issues facing the country. In their review of the book, CNN declared \"As more voters, politicos and talk-show hosts write off affirmative action as a well-intentioned anachronism, \"A Hope in the Unseen\" should be required reading for would-be opinion-mongers.\" In his review for Newsday, Bill Reel stated \"I changed my thinking about affirmative action. I was against it, now I am for it. The agent of change was a mind-opening book - \"A Hope in the Unseen\" by Ron Suskind.\"\\n\\nThe book also drew high praise for its innovations to writing style - using exhaustive reporting to place readers inside the heads of characters. The Chicago Tribune called the book, \"the new, new nonfiction. \"\\n\\nOn March 25, 2009 \"All Things Considered\" ran a segment about A Hope in the Unseen on NPR. During the segment, Susan Jane Gilman, the author of \"Undress Me in the Temple of Heaven\", described her affinity for Suskind\\'s work. \"Suskind\\'s literary talent is double barreled. He\\'s a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist who lived with the Jennings at close range for several years.

It is 8\\xa0miles north of Liverpool city centre and is located on the coast near the boundary of the Mersey Estuary and Liverpool Bay. The River Alt joins the sea at this point and forms an estuary. There is a pumping station on the River Alt at Altmouth, built 1972, as part of a programme to alleviate flooding in the area. This is on the Altcar Rifle Range, a Territorial Army base originally established in 1860 by Lt. Col. Gladstone.\\n\\nThe village is featured in \\'Lancashire Life\\' magazine, May 2004 \\'Tales of the sea at Hightown, near Southport\\' pp.\\xa0150–154\\nby Harold Brough, photographs by John Cocks.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nA dictionary of English Place-Names, A. D. Mills (OUP, Oxford, 1991) lists only a Hightown as a part of Congleton in Cheshire (there is also part of Banbury in Oxfordshire called Hightown). However specific books on Lancashire place names do list this Hightown in what was formerly Lancashire. Altmouth as a settlement features on many old maps prior to the 18th Century, north of where the village is now, bordering Altcar parish. Alt Grange is recorded as 13th Century. David Mills in his book \"The place-names of Lancashire\" does give High Town dated 1702. However he gives no source or reference. Understandably Mills appears to have not visited the small West Lancashire coastal village or he would not have given the description \"the major town .. The name appears to be modern and self-explanatory\". The first recorded mention of the place name Hightown is in Nicholas Blundell\\'s Diaries. Nicholas Blundell\\'s Diaries, Vol. 3 1720 (published 1972) refers to visiting High-Town Greene on the 18 May 1722 (p.\\xa077). There is still a village green today (oddly triangular) near the pub and railway station but unlike when Nicholas Blundell visited there are no cattle pens on it. However the earliest record of the place is probably in a probate record for Richard Riding of Moorhouses in Little Crosby husbandman from 1715. Moorhouses was a hamlet on the shore where Hightown is today, it is remembered in the name of one of the modern closes. The inventory for Richard Riding\\'s property records it as being of the property of “Richard Rydeing of the Hytown within Crosbie Parava.” High Town is recorded on Greenwood\\'s Map of Lancashire, 1818, north east of where the village is today, approximately at the junction of Orrell Hill Lane with the modern A565\\n\\nHightown is historically part of the estate of the Blundell family of Little Crosby and many houses still pay a nominal ground rent annually to the Whitlock-Blundell estate. Hightown beach is the site of a former wartime military base known as Fort Crosby. The fort was situated midway between Hightown and Hall Road and housed a number of Italian and German POW\\'s during WWII. Following its decommission at the end of the war a small cinema screen within the complex was reputedly used by local residents for a number of years until the camp was finally demolished in the mid-1960s. Remains of many of the buildings, pathways and fences can still be seen today.\\n\\nDuring the early part of the 20th century the village formed its own voluntary fire service following a number of deaths and injuries resulting from the excessive time taken for the Crosby Fire Service to reach the village. The most notable of these incidents was the loss of a family during a blaze within the lighthouse which once stood close to the site of Fort Crosby. The lighthouse was built in 1839. The most prominent buildings at the turn of the 20th Century were the Truant School, next to the railway line, and the Hightown Hotel (the village pub). In 1901 “There were 20 officials and 114 boys in the truant school at Hightown, belonging to the Liverpool education authority.”\\n\\nListed buildings and Second World War remains. heritagegateway.org.uk (a partnership project of English Heritage) lists Hightown Cross and three listed buildings in Hightown: the Cross itself, Whitedge Farmhouse (Alt Road) and Rose Cottage. In the immediate vicinity Moss Farmhouse, North End Lane, is also listed. Three World War Two invasion defence pillboxes can be seen near Gorsey Lane and are listed in the database, each as: Type 23 World War II concrete pillbox, constructed in the period 1940 to 1941. These are found in the Defence of Britain Archive of the Council for British Archaeology, 2002.\\n\\nListed as in poor condition (surveyed in 2000) is Coastal Battery S0011771 (Crosby Point Battery), between Coastguard Station and Hightown, north of Crosby. This is near the end of the West Lancs Golf Course, a mile south from Hightown station just off the footpath from Hall Road to Hightown. When Sefton Council upgraded the Sefton Coastal Footpath they blocked up two gun emplacements that remained of the Fort Crosby site. A former resident alleged in 2011 that Sefton Council had deliberately neglected the World War II heritage at Hightown, but there is no evidence of deliberate neglect. An exhibition by artist Tom Fairclough \\'Collateral\\' contained peaceful but evocative pictures of the rubble that make up the sea defences at the mouth of the Alt. Fairclough documented how the rubble was the remains of houses from the destruction in Bootle in the blitz of May 1941.\\n\\nThe most authoritative local history reference on Hightown, Merseyside is:\\n\"My Hightown 1897 - 1969\" by Joe Bulman. 1st ed. 1975. The 3rd ed. revised and enlarged by Andrew Lee-Hart and\\nMatthew Tinker published by Sefton Libraries Corporation, Southport, 2003. This edition of the book contains 40 photographs, 2 maps & 8 appendices including personal stories of men listed on the Hightown War Memorial (Appendix 3 by Hal Giblin), and history of The Truant School (Appendix 7 by Andrew Lee-Hart).\\n\\nSection::::Transport.\\nThe village is served by Hightown railway station, on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. Services run to Southport and to Hunts Cross via Liverpool city centre. The Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway opened in 1848 (from Southport to Waterloo initially). It was absorbed in the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, 1850. There is also a local bus service that runs to Hall Road, located in nearby Crosby.\\n\\nSection::::Sport.\\nThe Blundellsands Sailing Club celebrated its centenary in 2007. The clubhouse is located on the foreshore and the post code is L38 0BU. On the beach, approximately 50\\xa0metres from the Sailing club are the remains of a three- to four-thousand-year-old forest.\\n\\nHightown also has its own sports club, the Hightown Club, which also celebrated its centenary in 2007. A brief history was written at this time and featured on the Club\\'s cricket website and in local media.\\n\\nToday the Hightown Club offers sporting and social facilities for lawn bowls, cricket, squash, tennis and junior football \\n, although in the past there have been highly successful hockey and rugby sections. The rugby section sadly folded in 2000 and men\\'s hockey merged with Northern in the mid-1980s.\\nThe Hightown ladies hockey team were one of the country\\'s most prominent clubs in the 1980s and 90s, when they were led by England international Maggie Souyave. Since then they have played in several locations outside the village before eventually settling at Cheshire club Bowdon.\\n\\nCricket is most prominent sport played at the club, with the 1st XI currently playing in the Premier League of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. The captain for the 2012 season will be Shaun Vosloo, who replaced Ian Sutcliffe following the latter\\'s 11-year reign as skipper.\\n\\nOn 16 January 2011 the Club was completely destroyed by a large fire due to an electrical fault near the function suite.\\nSince the fire, all the sporting sections have been using temporary facilities and the club is planning a complete rebuild of the clubhouse, with work to commence in 2012.\\n\\nSection::::Governance.\\nFrom 1950 until 2010 Hightown was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party. Prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the Crosby by-election, 1981 where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Hightown, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.\\n\\nFor elections to Sefton Council the village and Civil parish of Hightown is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hightown, Merseyside', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115715'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'bxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11157284', 'text': \"Student Connections\\n\\nStudent Connections (SC) is a federally sponsored, Canada-wide initiative that provides E-business and Internet training services to small- and medium-sized businesses as well as senior citizens.\\n\\nFounded in 1996, the program is funded by Industry Canada and the Canadian government's Youth Employment Strategy and operates out of colleges and universities across the country, giving post-secondary students practical experience working with private-sector businesses to develop effective E-commerce strategies.\\n\\nThere are currently 17 centres in operation across Canada.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Student Connections', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11157284'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'cBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11159097', 'text': 'Delta G Scientific Company\\n\\nDelta G Scientific Company was originally a front company established April 1982 in Weldegraan by the South African Defence Force to research and produce chemical weapons within a covert operation known as Project Coast.\\n\\nMedchem Consolidated Investments was registered in the Cayman Islands by a David Webster on behalf of Wouter Basson, who held 75% of Delta G shares.\\n\\nDelta G was acquired in 1993 by Sentrachem, which is since 1997 a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Delta G Scientific Company', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11159097'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'cRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111623', 'text': 'Sparland, Illinois\\n\\nSparland is a village in Marshall County, Illinois, United States.

Popular performers included Bohdan Smoleń (joined in 1977), Jadwiga Żywczak Marian Pogasz, Rudi Schuberth Janusz Rewiński, Grażyna Łobaszewska, Zbigniew Górny, Zbigniew Wodecki and Małgorzata Ostrowska, with music written by Włodzimierz Korcz (author of \"Żeby Polska była Polską\", the informal anthem of \"Solidarity\"). The most popular of these were Laskowik and Smoleń, who often performed as a team.\\n\\nThe cabaret style relied heavily on improvisation. Its first significant award was the satirical \"Szpilki\" magazine\\'s \"Złota Szpilka\" (the Golden Pin) award at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole in 1973; this award also did much to popularize the cabaret. From 1977 the group worked with Polish national television (Telewizja Polska). As the communist system of the People\\'s Republic of Poland began to wind down, so did Kabaret TEY, whose career was very much built on parodying the existing political system and communist reality. The group had another successful performance in Opole in 1980, and toured both Poland and some other countries. In 1984 it changed its name to TEYATR. Its last performance in Poland took place in 1987 and the last performance for Polonia (Polish diaspora in the United States and Canada) took place in 1988.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nKabaret TEY was one of the most popular Polish cabarets in the 1970s and 1980s. Its fame was such that in the mid-1980s, it became one of the main icons associated with Poznań, and some of the jokes and phrases coined in it have entered the Polish language and culture.\\n\\nThe group texts became more political in the aftermath of the rise of Solidarity and introduction of the martial law in Poland in 1981.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kabaret TEY', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11163527'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1116391', 'text': 'Mikhail Volkenshtein\\n\\nMikhail Vladimirovich Volkenshtein (October 23, 1912 – February 18, 1992) was a notable Russian biophysicist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor and Doktor nauk.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nHe was Head of the Department of the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor of the Moscow State University, member of the Editorial Board of the Journal \"\"Molekuliarnaya Biologia\"\" of the Russian Academy of Sciences, winner of the State Prize of the former Soviet Union. \\n\\nVolkenshtein created the Leningrad school of polymer science in the early 1950.

Political freedom was described as freedom from oppression or coercion, the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, or the absence of life conditions of compulsion, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society. Although political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action, it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights. The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social conformity, consistency, or inauthentic behaviour). The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.\\n\\nSection::::Views.\\nVarious groups along the political spectrum naturally differ on what they believe constitutes true political freedom.\\n\\nLeft-wing political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of positive liberty, or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.\\n\\nClassical liberal Friedrich Hayek criticized this as a misconception of freedom: [T]he use of \"liberty\" to describe the physical \"ability to do what I want\", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us [...] has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument[.] [T]he notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.\\n\\nAnarcho-socialists see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one\\'s labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by capitalism as \"selfish freedom\".\\n\\nAnarcho-capitalists see negative rights as a consistent system. Ayn Rand described it as \"a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context\". To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which by definition trump other moral considerations. Any alleged right which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services and so on) produced by people is in effect a purported right to enslave others.\\n\\nSome notable philosophers, such as Alasdair MacIntyre, have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.\\n\\nIn his book \"Capitalism and Freedom\", American economist Milton Friedman argues that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and economic freedom. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by Robin Hahnel in his article \"Why the Market Subverts Democracy\". Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedman’s understanding of economic freedom, i.e. that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights system—which Friedman fails to provide or specify directly. \\n\\nAccording to political philosopher Nikolas Kompridis, the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as autonomy or independence and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.\\n\\nPolitical freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by Michel Foucault. It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by Cornelius Castoriadis, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Rancière and Theodor Adorno.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of ecosystems. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create negative externalities, which violates other groups\\' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of SUVs, golf and urban sprawl has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and ecological conservation can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of values reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of PETA regarding fur.\\n\\nJohn Dalberg-Acton stated: \"The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities\".\\n\\nGerald C. MacCallum Jr. spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. It is triadic in relation to each other because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nHannah Arendt traces freedom\\'s conceptual origins to ancient Greek politics. According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of freedom of the will, or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is \"the raison d\\'être of politics\".\\n\\nArendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to sovereignty or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to \"begin anew\", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as \"new beginnings and hence beginners\".\\n\\nIn Arendt\\'s view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of \"the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known\".\\n\\n', 'title': 'Political freedom', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11175', 'cat_id': '11175', 'cat_title': '1756_in_Ireland', 'cat_pages': '2', 'cat_subcats': '1', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ghhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11179029', 'text': 'Hanover Heights Neighborhood Historic District\\n\\nThe Hanover Heights Historic District area was developed between 1912 and 1930.

Evidence suggests they are an effective material as they are biocompatible, aesthetic, insoluble and have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale. For certain dental prostheses, such as three-unit molars porcelain fused to metal or in complete porcelain group, zirconia-based restorations are recommended.\\n\\nThe word \"ceramic\" is derived from the Greek word \"keramos\", meaning \"potter\\'s clay\". It came from the ancient art of fabricating pottery where mostly clay was fired to form a hard, brittle object; a more modern definition is a material that contains metallic and non-metallic elements (usually oxygen). These materials can be defined by their inherent properties including their hard, stiff, and brittle nature due to the structure of their inter-atomic bonding, which is both ionic and covalent. In contrast, metals are non-brittle (display elastic behavior), and ductile (display plastic behaviour) due to the nature of their inter-atomic metallic bond. These bonds are defined by a cloud of shared electrons with the ability to move easily when energy is applied. Ceramics can vary in opacity from very translucent to very opaque. In general, the more glassy the microstructure (i.e. noncrystalline) the more translucent it will appear, and the more crystalline, the more opaque.\\n\\nSection::::Composition.\\nCeramic used in dental application differs in composition from conventional ceramic to achieve optimum aesthetic components such as translucency. Their composition is as follows:\\n\\nSection::::Classification.\\nCeramics can be classified based on the following:\\nSection::::Classification by Microstructure.\\nAt the microstructural level, ceramics can be defined by the nature of their composition of amorphous-to-crystalline ratio. There can be an infinite variability of the microstructures of materials, but they can be broken down into four basic compositional categories, with a few subgroups:\\n\\nDental ceramic is generally regarded as biologically inert. However, other toxicities may exist from depleted uranium as well as some of the other accessory materials; in addition, the restoration may increase wear on opposing teeth.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Types of Ceramics.\\nThe range of dental ceramics determined by their respective firing temperatures are:\\nFired below 850\\xa0°C - mainly used for shoulder ceramics (aims to combat the problem of shrinkage, specifically at the margins of the prep, when the early sintered ceramic state is fired to produce the final restoration), to correct minor defects and to add colour/shading to restorations\\nFired between 850 and 1100\\xa0°C - to prevent the occurrence of distortion, this type of ceramic should not be subjected to multiple firings\\nThis type is used mainly for denture teeth\\n\\nSection::::Laboratory Procedure.\\nThe dentist will usually specify a shade or combination of shades for different parts of the restoration, which in turn corresponds to a set of samples containing the porcelain powder. There are two types of porcelain restorations: \\n\\nCeramic restorations can be built on a refractory die, which is a reproduction of a prepared tooth made of a strong material with the ability to withstand high temperatures, or it can be constructed on a metal coping or core.\\n\\nFor ceramic fused to metal restorations, the black color of metal is first masked with an opaque layer giving it a shade of white before consecutive layers are built up. The powder corresponding to the desired shade of dentine base is mixed with water before it is fired. Further layers are built up to mimic the natural translucency of the enamel of the tooth. The porcelain is fused to a semi-precious metal or precious metal, such as gold, for extra strength.\\n\\nSystems which use an aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide or zirconia core instead of metal, produces complete porcelain restorations.\\n\\nSection::::Firing.\\nOnce the mass has been built up, it is fired to allow fusion of the ceramic particles which in turn forms the completed restoration; the process by which this is done is referred to as ‘baking’.\\n\\nThe first bake forces water out and allows the particles to coalesce. During this initial process, a large amount of shrinkage occurs until the mass reaches an almost void-free state; to overcome this the mass is built-up to a size larger than the final restoration will be.\\n\\nThe mass is then left to cool slowly to prevent cracking and reduced strength of the final restoration.\\n\\nAdding more layers to build up the restoration to the desired shape and/or size requires the ceramic to undergo further rounds of firing.\\n\\nSection::::Staining.\\nCeramic can also be stained to show tooth morphology such as occlusal fissures and hypoplastic spots. These stains can be incorporated within the ceramic or applied onto the surface.\\n\\nSection::::Glazing.\\nGlazing is required to produce a smooth surface and it\\'s the last stage of sealing the surface as it will fill porous areas and prevent wear on opposing teeth. Glazing can be achieved by re-firing the restoration, which fuses outer layers of the ceramic, or by using glazes with lower fusing temperatures; these are applied on the outer surface of the restoration in a thin layer. Any adjustments are then made with polishing rubbers and fine diamonds.\\n\\nSection::::Use of CAD-CAM.\\nRecent developments in CAD/CAM dentistry uses special partially sintered ceramic (zirconia), glass-bonded ceramic or glass-ceramic (lithium disilicate) formed into machinable blocks, which are fired again after machining.\\n\\nBy utilising in-office CAD/CAM technology, clinicians are able to design, fabricate and place all-ceramic inlays, onlays, crowns and veneers in a single patient visit. Ceramic restorations produced by this method have demonstrated excellent fit, strength and longevity. Two basic techniques can be used for CAD/CAM restorations:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Indications for Ceramic Restorations.\\nCeramic restorations are indicated for most dental applications including:\\nHowever, each system will have its own set of specific indications and contraindications which can be obtained from the manufacturers guideline.\\n\\nSection::::Contraindications for Ceramic Restorations.\\nCeramic restorations are contraindicated when a patient presents with the following: \\n\\nSection::::Other uses.\\nSection::::Denture Teeth.\\nPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is the material of choice for denture teeth, however ceramic denture teeth have been, and still are used for this purpose. The main benefit associated with the use of ceramic teeth is their superior wear resistance. There are however a number of disadvantages to using ceramic for denture teeth including their inability to form chemical bonds with the PMMA denture base; rather, ceramic teeth are attached to the base via mechanical retention which increases the chance of debonding during use over time. Additionally, they are more likely to fracture due to their brittle nature.\\n\\nSection::::Endodontic Posts.\\nCeramic can be used in the construction of non-metallic posts, however, it is a brittle material and as such may fracture within the root canal or may cause fracture of the root due to its increased strength. Another disadvantage is that once placed, removal may not be possible.\\n', 'title': 'Dental porcelain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117992'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11180699', 'text': 'Yūsei Oda\\n\\n, is a Japanese voice actor from Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Yūsei Oda', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11180699'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111866', 'text': 'Auburn, Illinois\\n\\nAuburn is a city in Sangamon County, Illinois, United States.

He was a member of the American Institute of Architects.\\n\\nSection::::Family and early life.\\nHopkins was born in Saratoga Springs, New York. His parents were Alfred Hopkins (1836-1884), a captain in the United States Navy, and Mary Elizabeth Penfield (1837-1898). They soon moved to Ohio where his parents gave birth to his brother Walter (b. 1879). Hopkins married Adelaide Spenlove (1894-1865) on June 30, 1915 in London, England. Following their marriage, Hopkins and his bride settled in New York City and had two sons—Alfred Spenlove Hopkins (1916-1995) and Peter Harrel Theodore Hopkins (1918-2004).\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nHopkins studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris followed by several years in Rome completing his knowledge architecture, presumably in the early 1890s. By 1898, he returned to New York City and was practicing as an architect.\\n\\nEarly in his career, Hopkins specialized in the design of farming complexes for the American capitalist during the Gilded Age. By 1900, he was designing a new farm group for Frederick W. Vanderbilt in Hyde Park, New York in association with Edward Burnett (1849-1925), an agricultural specialist who earlier developed and managed the farming operations for other members of the Vanderbilt family. Hopkins and Burnett maintained an office at 11 East 24th Street in New York City. Together they designed some of the country\\'s most extraordinary farms, including Foxhollow, the Tracy Dows estate in Rhinebeck, New York, and a farm for Harry J. Fisher in Greenwich, Connecticut. Their collaboration, though not firmly documented during this time, probably resulted in several other farm projects associated with Hopkins New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Their work, particularly Hopkins architectural style, established the standard for farm architecture and influenced an entire generation of architects.\\n\\nIn 1913, he severed his association with Burnett and established himself as Alfred Hopkins & Associates located in the Architects Building at 101 Park Avenue in New York City. Hopkins continued specializing in gentlemen\\'s farms, quickly establishing himself as the \"dean of farm group architecture,\" due in no small part to the success of his \"Modern Farm Buildings,\" first published in 1913 (dedicated to Edward Burnett) and two subsequent editions (with the Burnett dedication omitted). Hopkins farm groups appeared in Westchester County, New York, the Hudson River Valley, northern New Jersey, Illinois. He designed no fewer than fifteen farm groups on Long Island, including the farm at Laurelton Hall for Louis Comfort Tiffany. An article on farm groupings published in \"Architectural Record\" in 1915 notes that Hopkins was often called upon to design the farm groups on estates where the residences were the work of other architects, such as Bertram Goodhue, John Russell Pope and Charles A. Platt.\\n\\nHopkins was among the contributors to \"Stables and Farm Buildings: A Special Number of the Architectural Review\" produced by the staff of \"Architectural Review\" in 1902. His \"Modern Farm Buildings\" served to publicize his practical and picturesque esthetic, and in common with all architects\\' publications since the sixteenth century, to attract clients. Hopkins\\' book went into a third edition.\\n\\nHopkins laid out his farm buildings around paved courts or grassed paddocks, keeping rooflines and eaves low to blend with the landscape, and carefully separating the necessary farming functions. He preferred to remove hay storage from its traditional loft over the stables to eliminate dust infiltration and ammonia pollution. Open-sided sheds housed farm vehicles. The spatial routes of cows and horses were kept separate. Farmhands\\' quarters were integrated with the buildings. An outstanding late survival of Hopkins\\' Cotswolds-inspired vernacular manner is the stable court at Hartwood, near Pittsburgh (1929). The same year he published a brochure distributed among architects, \"Two Cotswolds Villages\", describing the vernacular architecture and stone-tiled roofs of two picturesque English villages: Bibury, Gloucestershire and Castle Combe, Wiltshire.\\n\\nHopkins is less known for his \"Prisons and Prison Building\" (New York: Architectural Book Publishing 1930), where rational planning met other ends, in a progressive and humane program based on the classification of prisoners and their segregation by groups in small units; proposals that argued against walled prisons and for the uplifting effect of good architecture. His practical experience was founded on his work at Westchester County Penitentiary, Berks County Prison, and his proposed designs for a federal prison to be built at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, completed in 1934.\\n\\nHopkins was also among the architects who published plans for inexpensive carpenter-built housing in \"Carpentry and Building\". and his small book \"Planning for sunshine and fresh air: Being sundry discourses & excursions in the pleasant art of building homes, set forth in a manner and upon a theory ... how best to effect their proper economies\" appeared in 1931.\\n\\nHe also published \"The Fundamentals of Good Bank Building\" (1929).\\n\\nAfter an interim following his death, an architectural firm was founded in 1954 by six associates from his office, as La Pierre, Litchfield & Partners.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Alfred Hopkins', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11201583'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'jhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11204257', 'text': 'Live in California 74\\n\\nLive in California 74 is a live DVD of the first California Jam concert performance from Deep Purple released in 2005.

Blackmore felt this would dull the effect of the band\\'s light show. After ABC brought in a sheriff to arrest him, Blackmore agreed to perform. At the culmination of the performance, he destroyed several of his guitars and threw one of his amplifier stacks off the edge of the stage. He also struck one of the ABC cameras five times with a guitar and, in recorded footage, can be seen arranging for his road crew to set off a pyrotechnic device in one of his amplifiers, creating a large fireball that was quickly extinguished.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be country that currently has \"sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\\n\\nIn other countries, such as Sweden since 1947, there is a concept of \"födelsehemort\" (\"domicile of birth\"), which means that the domicile of the baby\\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\\n\\nSometimes the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to with the Latin phrase \"jus soli\" (it depends on the law of the country to give the nationality). More often, this may also depend on the nationality or nationalities of the parents (referred to as \"jus sanguinis\"). \\n\\nThere can be some confusion on the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born in an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality/nationalities of the parents and/or the position of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\\n\\nSome applications may request the \"Country of Birth\" of the applicant. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the \"Place of Birth\" or \"Nationality at Birth\" of the applicant.

She was the first ship named for Seaman Daniel Hogan.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" was launched by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 12 April 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Magnus A. Anderson, a sister of the Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane and commissioned 1 October 1919, Lieutenant Commander E.\\xa0M. Williams in command.\\n\\nSection::::Service history.\\nAfter shakedown, \"Hogan\" arrived at San Diego on 21 November to join the Pacific Destroyer Force. From 23 November to 6 February 1920 she sailed in company with her division and engaged in fleet maneuvers, patrol duty, torpedo exercises and target practice along the California coast. On 25 March she departed for Hawaii, where she operated for the next month. The destroyer rejoined her squadron at San\\xa0Diego in late April for five months of gunnery exercises and trial runs in that area. She returned to San\\xa0Diego in early 1921 and engaged in important experimental torpedo practice and divisional operations until 9 December. During that time, in October, \"Hogan\" became the first US Navy ship to be refuelled while underway, towed astern by the oiler . For the remainder of her service \"Hogan\" assisted U.S. battleships in conducting torpedo firing exercises in the Pacific. She decommissioned at San Diego on 27 May 1922.\\n\\nRecommissioned 7 August 1940, \"Hogan\" underwent conversion to a high speed minesweeper at Mare Island and reclassified DMS-6. Her activity up to World War II consisted mainly of intensified minesweeper training and patrol duty in the Caribbean and along the Eastern Coast,\\n\\nSection::::World War II.\\nDuring the early months of the war, \"Hogan\" acted as a convoy escort in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic, protecting shipping from U-boat attack. The first major operation in which she took part was the invasion of North Africa in late 1942. For this important amphibious assault, mounted over an entire ocean, \"Hogan\" departed Norfolk 24 October and arrived with the Center Force off Fedhala for preliminary sweeps 7 November. As the landings began early next day, the minesweeper continued to patrol the vital transport area. Just after 05:00, she was sent to investigate strange running lights and came upon a French steamer and escort vessel. \"Hogan\" ordered both ships to reverse course, and when the order was not obeyed fired a burst of machine gun fire across the escort\\'s bow. The ship, \"Victoria\", replied with fire of her own and attempted to ram the minesweeper, but \"Hogan\" avoided her and with 20\\xa0mm fire forced her surrender.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, the minesweeper continued to conduct antisubmarine patrol off Fedhala, searching for submarines that attacked the transports on 11 November. The ship entered Casablanca harbor on 18 November, the invasion a success, and after patrol duties sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 26 December.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" next returned to coastal convoy duties until November 1943. She sailed on 13 November from Norfolk to join the Pacific Fleet, transited the Panama Canal, arriving at Mare Island on 5 December. The minesweeper was needed for the first phase of the long island campaign toward Japan, the invasion of the Marshalls, and sailed for Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein on 16 January 1944. \"Hogan\" carried out anti-submarine patrol off Roi Island before departing on 4 February for Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on 27 February.\\n\\nAfter another period of convoy duty, \"Hogan\" arrived at Milne Bay on 7 April to prepare for the Hollandia operation. The attack group sailed on 18 April and arrived at Humboldt Bay four days later. \"Hogan\" and other minesweepers cleared enemy mines for Admiral Daniel Barbey\\'s invasion force, after which the ship carried out shore bombardment and screening duties. She arrived at Cape Sudest with on 25 April.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" sailed from Eniwetok on 10 June to make preliminary sweeps of Saipan for the invasion to come. She remained off Saipan during the assault on 15 June, coming under enemy shore fire, and moved to Guam the next day. As the Japanese fleet moved toward the Marianas for a decisive naval battle, \"Hogan\" returned to Saipan to protect the transports. In the great carrier battle which followed 19–20 June, the American fleet won a stunning victory, crippling the Japanese naval air arm and securing the Marianas operation from interference. \"Hogan\" returned to the staging base at Eniwetok on 30 June, but returned to Guam on 12 July to carry out screening and minesweeping duties for the assault there. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 5 August 1944.\\n\\nFollowing a tour of escort duty in the Solomons, \"Hogan\" steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco for repairs, arriving on 5 October. As the recapture of the Philippines gained momentum, the ship steamed from San Francisco on 6 November and arrived at the Manus staging area on 4 December 1944. Moving to Leyte Gulf before Christmas, \"Hogan\" sortied with the Minesweeping and Hydrographic Group on 2 January 1945. Kamikaze attacks began soon afterward, and continued during the voyage to Lingayen Gulf. The minesweepers entered the invasion area on 2 January and began their sweeping operations. Four of the minesweepers were sunk or damaged, and \"Hogan\"s gunners were busy with attacking aircraft. With the operation well underway, the ship arrived at Leyte Gulf on 16 January.\\n\\nAfter retiring to Tinian, \"Hogan\" sailed once more on 7 February to take part in the important assault on Iwo Jima. During this operation she swept mines, screened transports, and carried out shore bombardment before departing with a group of battleships and their escorts 7 March. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 13 April via Ulithi she continued to San Diego on 3 May 1945.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" underwent major repairs and reclassified AG-105 on 5 June 1945.

Small spermatoceles are relatively common, occurring in an estimated 30 percent of all men. They vary in size from several millimeters to many centimeters. Spermatoceles are generally not painful. However, some men may experience discomfort from larger spermatoceles. They are not cancerous, nor do they cause an increased risk of testicular cancer. Additionally, unlike varicoceles, they do not reduce fertility. \\n\\nSection::::Causes.\\nSpermatoceles can originate as diverticulum from the tubules found in the head of the epididymis. Sperm formation gradually causes the diverticulum to increase in size, causing a spermatocele. They are due to continuity between the epididymis and tunica vaginalis.\\n\\nThey are also believed to result from epididymitis, physical trauma, or vasectomy. Scarring of any part of the epididymis can cause it to become obstructed and in turn form a spermatocele.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nSpermatoceles can be discovered as incidental scrotal masses found on physical examination by a physician. They may also be discovered by self-inspection of the scrotum and testicles.\\n\\nFinding a painless, cystic mass at the head of the epididymis, that transilluminates and can be clearly differentiated from the testicle, is generally sufficient. If uncertainty exists, ultrasonography of the scrotum can confirm if it is spermatocele.\\n\\nSection::::Treatment.\\nSmall cysts are best left alone, as are larger cysts that are an asymptomatic condition. Only when the cysts are causing discomfort and are enlarging in size, or the patient wants spermatocele removed, should a spermatocelectomy be considered. Pain may persist even after removal.\\n\\nSpermatocelectomy can be performed on an outpatient basis, with the use of local or general anesthesia.\\n\\nA spermatocelectomy will not improve fertility.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Spermatocele', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122321'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'nhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1122413', 'text': '1969 United States Grand Prix\\n\\nThe 1969 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 5, 1969, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York.

Andretti charged ahead from his thirteenth-place grid position, and, when Brabham slowed to avoid Hulme, Andretti bumped rear wheels with the Brabham, knocking the Lotus sideways. Andretti continued for three laps, but his suspension was bent, and he retired. At the end of the first lap, the order was Rindt, Stewart, Hill, Siffert, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Courage and Ickx.\\nAs they had many times during the season, Rindt and Stewart quickly separated themselves from the rest of the field. On lap 12, Rindt slid wide and allowed Stewart through. The Matra\\'s engine was not running at full strength, however, and it was all Stewart could do to hold off the Austrian, who was bobbing and weaving on both sides, trying to get by. Rindt finally got past on the straight on lap 21, and eventually, the Scot began to fall back.\\nOn lap 33, Stewart\\'s car emitted a puff of smoke, and the next time around, he coasted down the pit lane with no oil pressure. Rindt now led a group of three Brabhams, with Courage ahead of the two works entries of Ickx and Brabham, by 37 seconds. On lap 62, Brabham got by Ickx and began hounding Courage. Several times, the Australian managed to pull alongside, but could not complete the pass. Ickx dropped out of the three-way fight on lap 78 when he suddenly lost oil pressure and pulled to the side of the track.\\n\\nRindt was content to maintain his cushion over Courage and Brabham, and tried not to think about all the times he had led before and not won. On lap 88, Hill spun off the track on a patch of oil and stalled. He unfastened his straps, got out of the car and push-started it, but could not refasten his belts alone. His off-track excursion had apparently punctured a rear tire, and he signaled the pit to get ready to change it. Before he made it back around, however, the tire exploded at the end of the straight and sent the Lotus cartwheeling into an embankment. Hill was thrown from the car and suffered broken bones in both legs. Later, at the hospital, he was asked by team members if he had a message to pass along to his wife. Hill replied, \"Just tell her that I won\\'t be dancing for two weeks.\" Hill\\'s accident was witnessed by two fifteen-year-old boys from nearby Montrose, Pennsylvania, John Moore and Kevin Hibbard. Their eyewitness account stated that \"It looked like the crash was unsurvivable. We thought he had definitely been killed.\"\\n\\nBrabham had to break off his pursuit of Courage when his engine began sputtering for lack of fuel, and he was forced to pit on lap 93, allowing Surtees to get through into third place. Rindt crossed the line 46 seconds ahead of Courage with his long-awaited and well-deserved first win. He said, \"It is just that the car held together for once, but this one makes up for all the others I have lost.\" Once again, the American race offered a record purse, and the total of $206,000 included $50,000 for the winner.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': '1969 United States Grand Prix', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122413'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'nxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1122561', 'text': '1972 Canadian Grand Prix\\n\\nThe 1972 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mosport Park on 24 September 1972.

Reshammiya has claimed the story is based on his own life and was named after his music album \"Aap Kaa Surroor\". It was shot mostly in Germany and was released on 29 June 2007. Critics panned the film although it turned out to be a super hit of 2007.\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nThe movie begins with a dead body of a TV journalist, Nadia Merchant, being found in a remote area, somewhere in Germany. Soon after, the most famous Indian singer HR (Himesh Reshammiya) is arrested after a concert for murdering the journalist. HR is put behind bars and the incidents begin to unravel as the movie goes into a flashback. While on a concert in Germany, performing with his best friend Shravan, HR meets the event organizer Khurana (Darshan Jariwala) and his partner Ruby James (Mallika Sherawat). He also meets the event planner Riya (Hansika Motwani), and it\\'s love at first sight. After initial reservations, Ria\\'s father (Sachin Khedekar) approves of the match.\\n\\nThings take a turn when HR is arrested. He asks Ruby, a lawyer, to bail him out. But hell hath no fury like a woman scorned: Ruby is in love with HR, but the rock star loves Riya. He escapes from his prison cell after taking the murdered TV journalist\\'s father Feroz (Raj Babbar) captive. He has to find the actual murderer in one day or else his sweetheart will be married to someone else. To stop this from happening, he needs Riya\\'s help. He approaches her; she is currently ignoring him.\\n\\nHR, Shravan, and Bani (Gurbani Judge) approach Ruby (on HR\\'s hunch that Ruby is innocent of the murders) for help. They browse through all the Invoices and other Documents in Khurana\\'s Office to find that acute losses on a previously finalized world tour deal gave Khurana the motive to frame HR.

Coventry City transferred him to Waterford in the summer of 1967 and he stayed with the Blues until 1975. Thomas is associated with bringing a new style of goalkeeping to the League of Ireland. He rarely kicked the ball on the offensive, throwing when possible with great accuracy. He also represented the League of Ireland XI and won five league medals and a FAI Cup medal and played in 12 European Cup matches for Waterford. It is not an exaggeration to say that Peter Thomas is a living legend in League of Ireland history and an almost mythical figure in Waterford football fans' memories.\\n\\nIn 1975, he moved to the United States where he played for the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League.

The majority of constitutive heterochromatin is found at the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes, but is also found at the telomeres and throughout the chromosomes. In humans there is significantly more constitutive heterochromatin found on chromosomes 1, 9, 16, 19 and Y. Constitutive heterochromatin is composed mainly of high copy number tandem repeats known as satellite repeats, minisatellite and microsatellite repeats, and transposon repeats. In humans these regions account for about 200Mb or 6.5% of the total human genome, but their repeat composition makes them difficult to sequence, so only small regions have been sequenced.\\n\\nVisualization of constitutive heterochromatin is possible by using the C-banding technique. The regions that stain darker are regions of constitutive heterochromatin. The constitutive heterochromatin stains darker because of the highly condensed nature of the DNA.\\n\\nConstitutive heterochromatin is not to be confused with facultative heterochromatin, which is less condensed, less stable, and much less polymorphic, and which does not stain when using the C-banding technique.\\nSection::::Function.\\nConstitutive heterochromatin is found more commonly in the periphery of the nucleus attached to the nuclear membrane. This concentrates the euchromatic DNA in the center of the nucleus where it can be actively transcribed. During mitosis it is believed that constitutive heterochromatin is necessary for proper segregation of sister chromatids and centromere function. The repeat sequences found at the pericentromeres are not conserved throughout many species and depend more on epigenetic modifications for regulation, while telomeres show more conserved sequences.\\n\\nConstitutive heterochromatin was thought to be relatively devoid of genes, but researchers have found more than 450 genes in the heterochromatic DNA of \"Drosophila melanogaster.\" These regions are highly condensed and epigenetically modified to prevent transcription. For the genes to be transcribed, they must have a mechanism to overcome the silencing that occurs in the rest of the heterochromatin. There are many proposed models for how the genes in these regions are expressed, including the insulation, denial, integration, exploitation, and TE restraining models.\\n\\nWhen genes are placed near a region of constitutive heterochromatin, their transcription is usually silenced. This is known as position-effect variegation and can lead to a mosaic phenotype.\\n\\nSection::::Replication and epigenetics.\\nConstitutive heterochromatin is replicated late in S phase of the cell cycle and does not participate in meiotic recombination.\\n\\nHistone modifications are one of the main ways that the cell condenses constitutive heterochromatin. The three most common modifications in constitutive heterochromatin are histone hypoacetylation, histone H3-Lys9 methylation (H3K9), and cytosine methylation. These modifications are also found in other types of DNA, but much less frequently. Cytosine methylation is the most common type, although it is not found in all eukaryotes. In humans there is increased methylation at the centromeres and telomeres, which are composed of constitutive heterochromatin. These modifications can persist through both mitosis and meiosis and are heritable.\\n\\nSUV39H1 is a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K9, providing a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). HP1 is involved in the chromatin condensing process that makes DNA inaccessible for transcription.\\n\\nSection::::Diseases.\\nGenetic disorders that result from mutations involving the constitutive heterochromatin tend to affect cell differentiation and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Disorders include Roberts syndrome and ICF syndrome.\\n\\nSome cancers are associated with anomalies in constitutive heterochromatin and the proteins involved in its formation and maintenance. Breast cancer is linked to a decrease in the HP1 alpha protein, while non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma is linked to hypomethylation of the genome and especially of satellite regions.\\n', 'title': 'Constitutive heterochromatin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122945'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'phhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11229767', 'text': 'Crazy like a Fox\\n\\nThe phrase \"crazy like a fox\" may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Crazy like a Fox', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11229767'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'pxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11229889', 'text': 'Codex Rehdigeranus\\n\\nCodex Rehdigerianus designated by \"l\" or by 11 (in Besauron numbering), is a medieval Latin manuscript written on parchment, which was held in the city library of Breslau.

It proceeds north as a divided, four-lane highway along Williams Boulevard through a largely residential neighborhood known as Kenner Heights.

Now flanked by commercial establishments, LA\\xa049 continues north through the center of the Highway Park subdivision. After another , LA\\xa049 intersects Veterans Memorial Boulevard, the principal east–west commercial thoroughfare of Kenner and neighboring Metairie. Here it widens to a divided, six-lane highway and remains in that capacity for the remainder of its route. It then immediately enters a complex interchange with I-10 at exit 223. I-10 heads toward Baton Rouge to the west and New Orleans to the east.\\n\\nJust north of the I-10 interchange, LA\\xa049 intersects 32nd Street, which leads to the nearby Esplanade Mall. LA\\xa049 continues north through intersections with West Esplanade Avenue and Vintage Drive as it passes alongside the Driftwood Park neighborhood. The route ends later at an intersection with a local road known as Joe Yenni Boulevard on the west and 44th Street on the east. Williams Boulevard continues north a short distance past the Pontchartrain Center, a large multi-purpose arena, to the Laketown recreation area and the Treasure Chest Casino on Lake Pontchartrain.\\n\\nThe route is classified as an urban principal arterial south of I-10 and an urban minor arterial north of I-10 by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La\\xa0DOTD). Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as follows: 20,700 from the southern terminus to West Metairie Avenue; 34,200 to Veterans Memorial Boulevard; and 48,200 to the northern terminus.

The first was State Route 452, designated in 1928. Route 452 followed Williams Boulevard from 3rd Street northward to what was then the Kenner city limits at 19th Street (now West Metairie Avenue). At the time, 3rd Street was part of the main route between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, followed first by the Jefferson Highway auto trail in 1916. This became State Route 1 in 1921 and the original route of US 61 in 1926.\\n\\nIn 1930, State Route 1249 was designated as an extension of Route 452, continuing the route of Williams Boulevard from 19th Street northward to Route 33.\\n\\nRoute 33 was the New Orleans–Hammond Lakeshore Highway, an ambitious scenic highway project that was intended to be part of US 51 but never completed. From 1933 to 1939, the section of Williams Boulevard south of Airline Highway served as a temporary link in US 61 while Airline Highway was being reconstructed between Kenner and Shrewsbury.\\n\\nLater maps show the entirety of Williams Boulevard as Route 1249 only, apparently absorbing Route 452, and remaining so until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.\\n\\nSection::::Post-1955 route history.\\nLA\\xa049 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of Route 1249.\\n\\nAt this time, the route still followed the entirety of Williams Boulevard from the Mississippi River at 3rd Street, which was now LA\\xa048, to Lake Pontchartrain. Since the late 1980s redevelopment of Kenner\\'s riverfront as the Rivertown Historic District, the southern portion of the route between LA\\xa048 and US\\xa061 has been returned to local control. The northern end of LA\\xa049 has also been slightly shortened from its original terminus at the Lake Pontchartrain levee.\\n\\nSection::::Future.\\nLa\\xa0DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \"right-sizing\" the state highway system, the portion of LA\\xa049 north of I-10 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Louisiana Highway 49', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11230852'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1123147', 'text': \"1992 Italian Grand Prix\\n\\nThe 1992 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Pioneer 63 Gran Premio d'Italia) was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 13 September 1992.

Patrese managed to overtake Alesi at the start of lap 2. The opening laps saw both Berger and Schumacher recovering many positions from the back of the field and overtaking a number of slower cars.\\n\\nAt the front Mansell opened a gap with Senna unable to match his pace. The positions were Mansell, Senna with Patrese closing down on him and then the two Ferraris of Alesi and Capelli. Next Martin Brundle managed to overtake Capelli and moved into 5th position. Lap 12 proved disastrous for the Ferrari team with both cars retiring, Alesi, who was in 4th, due to a mechanical problem and Capelli spinning off at the Parabolica with electronic problems. On lap 14 Patrese overtook Senna and moved into second. Meanwhile, Berger pitted for new tyres and dropped back again. On lap 17 the situation was Mansell in first, 10 seconds in front of Patrese, then Senna at 2 seconds from the second Williams. Fourth was Brundle, some 28 seconds behind Mansell and then Boutsen and Herbert at over 40 seconds from Mansell. Lap 18 saw Herbert retiring from 6th with an engine issue.\\n\\nOn lap 20 Patrese suddenly appeared in the lead as Mansell let his teammate take the lead. The order was Patrese followed closely by Mansell and Senna in third. Schumacher overtook Boutsen and moved into 5th place. Positions at lap 27 were: 1.Patrese, 2.Mansell, 3.Senna, 4.Brundle, 5.Schumacher and 6.Boutsen. As the lead trio lapped the slower cars of Berger and Comas Mansell continued to stay very close to Patrese and Senna tried his best not to lose contact with the two Williams cars as well, in fact he closed up on Mansell momentarily when the Williams had to take avoiding action of Comas at the Roggia. On lap 41 Mansell slowed through the Ascari bends and coasted into the pits with gearbox failure from loss of hydraulic pressure and had to retire. Classification at lap 44 was: Patrese, Senna at 6 secs, Brundle at 28 secs, Schumacher at over 50 secs, then Berger and De Cesaris both a lap down. Patrese led comfortably until 6 laps from the end he suffered a hydraulic problem, forcing him to slow down and concede the lead to Ayrton Senna. In the closing stages of the race Senna allowed his teammate Berger to unlap himself. Patrese limped to the end of the race and finished 5th.\\n\\nSenna won the race in what turned to be his last win with a Honda-powered car. The other places on the podium went to the two Benettons of Brundle and Schumacher.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': '1992 Italian Grand Prix', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123147'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11235634', 'text': 'National Museum of Fine Arts, Malta\\n\\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts () was an art museum in Valletta, Malta. It housed a collection of works by Maltese and foreign artists mainly representing the major European artistic styles. The museum was inaugurated on 7 May 1974, and it was located at Admiralty House, an 18th-century palace which was formerly the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. The museum was closed down on 2 October 2016, and there are plans to reopen it as MUŻA (from the Maltese acronym \"Mużew tal-Arti\") at Auberge d\\'Italie in 2018.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts, at the Admiralty House, was inaugurated by Minister of Education and Culture Agatha Barbara on 7 May 1974. Its collection had previously formed part of the National Museum at Auberge de Provence. Following the split, the museum at the auberge was left with archaeological artifacts, and it was renamed the National Museum of Archaeology. The museum was managed by Heritage Malta.\\n\\nIn 2013, plans began to be made to move the museum from Admiralty House to Auberge d\\'Italie. In September 2014, it was announced that the move will occur and the new museum would be called \"MUŻA\" (from the Maltese acronym \"Mużew Nazzjonali tal-Arti\"). The museum at Admiralty House closed down on 2 October 2016, and the new museum is set to open in 2018 as one of the projects of Valletta\\'s title of European Capital of Culture.\\n\\nThe museum saw 30,000 patrons every day in 2012 and the relocation aim to increase the number of visitors.\\n\\nSection::::Location.\\nThe museum was housed at the Admiralty House, a palace in Valletta, originally built in the 16th century as a residence for the knight Fra Jean de Soubiran dit Arafat. The present building dates back to 1761–63, when it was reconstructed in the Baroque style for the Portuguese knight Fra Raimondo de Sousa y Silva. From 1821 to 1961, the building was the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, hence the name \"Admiralty House\". \\n\\nAdmiralty House is located at South Street in Valletta. Apart from the museum itself, the area contains several fine historical palaces dating from the times of the Order of St. John that are now used by government ministries and departments. It is also well known for its wine bars and cafes, and views of the city\\'s grid-shaped streets.\\n\\nSection::::Collections.\\nSection::::Fine arts.\\nThe museum housed the major part of the national collection of Malta. The collection began in 1923 when the first fine arts curator, Vincenzo Bonello, embarked on establishing a collection within what was then called the National Museum. Bonello acquired numerous works of excellent quality on the local art market, and in London and Italy. Most were purchased at a time when prices in the art market where still within reach of the museum\\'s modest budget. Public spirited individuals and organizations also left significant bequests. \\nThe permanent display included the largest collection of paintings by the Southern Italian Baroque artist Mattia Preti (1613–1699), an Italian Knight of the Order of Malta who also contributed to the transformation of the interior of St. John’s Co-Cathedral in Valletta. This, together with a fine and rare collection of antique maps, represented one of the strengths of the collection.\\n\\nThe works of other artists on display included Guido Reni (1575–1642), the Caravaggisti Valentin de Boulogne (1591–1632), Giuseppe Ribera (1591–1662) and Matthias Stom (1600–1652), as well as Carlo Maratta (1625–1713) and Bernardo Strozzi (1581–1644). Works by Dutch, French and British artists were also on permanent display.\\n\\nThe collection also included the works of two outstanding Maltese sculptors, Melchiorre Gafà (1636–1667) and Antonio Sciortino (1879–1947), and a noteworthy group of Maltese landscapes. The Grand Harbour of Malta and its environs is the subject of a Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851) watercolour. Other works by Edward Lear (1812–1888), Louis Ducros (1748–1810) and local artists representing the same subject were also on display.\\n\\nSection::::Furniture and silverware.\\nThe museum exhibited a collection of Maltese furniture and silverware, as well as majolica jars mainly of Sicilian production. Many of the jars were in use at the Sacra Infermeria, the Hospital of the Order of St John. Ecclesiastical silverware was also on display, including a rare fifteenth century chalice of Parisian workmanship.\\n\\nSection::::Temporary exhibitions.\\nThe museum had a very active calendar of temporary exhibitions mainly by Maltese artists.

Brunner was subsequently arrested for numerous offenses, including credit card theft and armed robbery, and served a prison sentence at the California Institution for Women.\\n\\nSection::::Meeting Charles Manson.\\nBorn and raised in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to George and Elsie Brunner, she moved to California upon graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1965 and took up a job as library assistant at UC Berkeley. She met 33-year-old career criminal Charles Manson who had been released from Terminal Island prison several weeks earlier. She let Manson stay at her apartment and, after a period of weeks, the two became lovers. Brunner was thus the first person Manson recruited into his Family. She quit her job and the two began to drift around California in a van meeting other young women. \\n\\nDuring the summer of 1967, Manson impregnated Brunner. On April 15, 1968 she gave birth to a son she named Valentine Michael, nicknamed \"Pooh Bear\" (Valentine Michael Smith is the name of the protagonist in Robert Heinlein\\'s 1961 novel \"Stranger In A Strange Land\") in a condemned house in Topanga Canyon and was assisted during the birth by several of the young women from the Family. Brunner (like most members of the group) acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: \"Marioche\", \"Och\", \"Mother Mary\", \"Mary Manson\", \"Linda Dee Manson\" and \"Christine Marie Euchts\". \\n\\nAfter arriving in Venice, California, Brunner and Manson met 18-year-old Lynette Fromme and the three began living together in a rented house at 636 Cole Street in San Francisco. Over the course of the following two years, the Family enlarged to include between 20 and 30 individuals living communally; some, like Brunner and Fromme, became ardent followers of Manson, while others drifted in and out of the group. \\n\\nAfter traveling along the California coast and excursions to Washington, Oregon and Nevada, the ever-growing number of young women and men eventually settled down at Spahn Ranch, an occasional film set operated by George Spahn, near the Los Angeles suburb of Chatsworth. Manson ostensibly based his commune on principles of freedom and love, but he exerted dictatorial control. In addition to having sex with Spahn and others, the female followers were sent to the city on criminal activities such as theft and fraud. Manson also had illegal firearms and played host to a motorcycle gang.\\n\\nSection::::Early arrest.\\nOn April 21, 1968 Brunner and Family members Manson, Susan Atkins, Ella Jo Bailey, Dianne Elizabeth Lake, Nancy Laura Pitman, Bruce Vann Hall, Marcus John Arneson and Suzanne Scott were arrested near Little Sycamore Canyon, in southern Ventura County, California. They were found sprawled nude around a campfire beside a 1952 bus \"stuck in a deep ditch\", that had been reported stolen in San Francisco on April 12. Manson was remanded into custody under the suspicion of grand theft auto and possession of two driver licenses. \\n\\nScott, Atkins, Lake and Hall were charged with possessing fictitious and fraudulent driver\\'s licenses. Pitman, Arneson and Bailey were jailed on charges of disorderly conduct and not possessing proper identification. Five other Family members were released without being charged. Brunner was booked on endangering the life and health of a child, after her one-week-old son, Valentine was found by deputies improperly dressed and shivering. The baby was placed in the care of the Ventura County General Hospital. \\n\\nCharges against Brunner were later reduced to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and she was given two years probation and a 15-day suspended jail sentence. She subsequently told authorities she planned to return to her parents\\' home in Wisconsin and Valentine was returned to her.\\n\\nSection::::The Hinman murder.\\nOn July 25, 1969, 21-year-old Family member, musician and aspiring actor Bobby Beausoleil left Spahn Ranch, accompanied by Brunner and group member Susan Atkins to pay a visit to an associate named Gary Allen Hinman at his home in Topanga Canyon, directly north of Malibu. Hinman had been friendly with the Family and had often allowed members to stay at his home. Both Beausoleil and Brunner had previously lived with Hinman for short periods of time and, according to a 1981 interview with Beausoleil, Brunner was close friends with Hinman. Beausoleil was in possession of a knife and a 9\\xa0mm Radom pistol that he had borrowed from Family member Bruce Davis.\\n\\nOn July 31, 1969, Hinman was found murdered in his home. His face had been deeply slashed on the left side and he had two stab wounds to the chest. Hinman\\'s house had been ransacked and the words \"Political Piggy\" written and a paw print (intended to be symbolic of the Black Panther Party) drawn on the wall in his blood. Both of Hinman\\'s vehicles were missing: a Volkswagen van and a Fiat station wagon. On August 5, 1969, Beausoleil was found by the California Highway Patrol asleep in the back of Hinman\\'s Fiat near San Luis Obispo, California. Beausoleil had a sheath knife attached to his belt. Robert Kenneth \"Bobby\" Beausoleil was arrested and charged with the murder of Gary Allen Hinman.\\n\\nOn August 8, 1969, Brunner and another Family member, Sandra Good, were arrested in San Fernando, California at a Sears store for purchasing items with a stolen credit card. Brunner had signed for her purchases with the alias \"Mary Vitasek\" and the two women fled the store when a cashier became suspicious. After being followed by the store manager, the police caught up with the two and found them in possession of numerous stolen credit cards and fake identification cards. They were charged with violating Section 459 (burglary) and 484e (grand theft by fraudulent use of credit card) of the California Penal Code and booked into the Sybil Brand Institute Reception Center later that evening.\\nOn the night of August 9, Family members Charles \"Tex\" Watson, Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and Patricia Krenwinkel went to 10050 Cielo Drive and murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate and her guests Wojciech Frykowski, Jay Sebring and Abigail Folger, as well as 18-year-old Steven Parent, who was visiting Tate\\'s groundskeeper William Garretson.\\n\\nSection::::Prosecution witness.\\nThere is agreement that Manson was behind the killing of Hinman. Brunner was present throughout and was the key witness for the prosecution. She testified at Beausoleil\\'s trial that Beausoleil killed Hinman (a musician), because Hinman had refused to join Manson\\'s pop group.\\n\\nSection::::Other hypotheses.\\nThere have been many other suggestions. Vincent Bugliosi, who was the prosecutor in the Tate-LaBianca case, claimed in his book that Manson instructed Beausoleil, Brunner and Atkins to go to Hinman\\'s house to get money and titles to Hinman\\'s vehicles. This account was later corroborated by various Family members. However, Beausoleil denied Manson\\'s direct involvement and disputed that neither Brunner nor Atkins had any direct knowledge of why he was visiting Hinman. \\n\\nBeausoleil contended that he went to Hinman\\'s home in order to confront Hinman and collect $1,000 from him. Beausoleil claimed that he had purchased from Hinman tabs of mescaline that he then sold to a biker gang called the Straight Satans. He further explained that several hours after the gang purchased the mescaline from Beausoleil, they showed up at Spahn Ranch, claiming the mescaline was poisoned with strychnine, demanded their money back and threatened to kill Beausoleil. \\n\\nBeausoleil contended that both Brunner and Atkins merely went along with him to Hinman\\'s because they \"liked\" Hinman and wanted to visit. In the interview, he states that neither he nor Brunner nor Atkins were instructed by Manson to go to Hinman\\'s and that he initially had no intention to kill him. This contradicted Beausoleil\\'s own testimony at his first trial in 1969, when he claimed that Manson did in fact instruct him to kill Hinman. Beausoleil claimed \"Mary Brunner was just scared to death. She just faded into the woodwork\" during the murder, but that Atkins went back into the house after Beausoleil stabbed Hinman and placed a pillow over Hinman\\'s face. He also contended that it was Atkins who wrote the words \"Political Piggy\" on Hinman\\'s wall (at Beausoleil\\'s instructions).\\nIn October 1969, police raided the Family\\'s new residence at Barker Ranch near Death Valley, California, holding most of the group in custody on charges of automobile theft. Among those arrested were Atkins, who, while being questioned by police sergeants Whitley and Guenther on October 13, 1969, implicated herself in the murder of Hinman and told the officers that Manson had sent her and Beausoleil to Hinman\\'s residence to force Hinman to hand over money that Manson believed Hinman had inherited. Atkins also told the police that Beausoleil alone acted in the murder of Hinman, stabbing him twice in the heart after detaining him in his home for over two days. Atkins also maintained that it was Beausoleil who slashed Hinman\\'s face, not Manson. However, Atkins gave several differing accounts of the murder of Hinman; at times claiming that she killed Hinman, Manson killed Hinman or that Beausoleil killed Hinman.\\n\\nSection::::Trial.\\nMary Brunner and Susan Atkins were subsequently charged along with Bobby Beausoleil for the murder of Gary Hinman. Brunner later received immunity from prosecution to testify against both Beausoleil and Atkins.<ref name=\"Crime/Punishment\">Mary Brunner profile, crime.about.com; accessed March 17, 2017.</ref> His first trial, which began in November 1969 ended in a hung jury, with Beausoleil claiming that Manson alone had murdered Hinman.\\n\\nHowever, during Beausoleil\\'s March 1970 trial, Brunner repudiated her testimony that Beausoleil murdered Hinman and Beausoleil produced an affidavit signed by Brunner stating that he did not stab Hinman. Called to the stand to testify, Brunner eventually repudiated her previous testimony and insisted that she had said Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death in her attempt to absolve Charles Manson of any participation in the crime. Various former Family members such as Ella Jo Bailey contradicted this testimony and testified that Manson confessed to them that he in fact was present at the Hinman house and that he fully participated in the murder.\\n\\nBeausoleil was sentenced to death, later commuted to life (See \"California v. Anderson\"); Atkins pleaded guilty for her participation in Hinman\\'s death and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Bruce Davis was charged in the murder after it was learned Beausoleil had called Davis at Spahn Ranch and asked him to come over and pick up Hinman\\'s Volkswagen van. Separate trials were held for the murders of Gary Hinman and Spahn Ranch worker Donald \"Shorty\" Shea, for Family members Davis, Charles Manson, and Steve \"Clem\" Grogan.\\n\\nBrunner subsequently returned to the remaining members of the Family and rallied support for those incarcerated for the Tate/LaBianca murders. Her son was sent to live with her parents.\\n\\nSection::::Hawthorne shootout.\\nOn August 21, 1971, Brunner, accompanied by Family member Catherine \"Gypsy\" Share and several male Family associates — Dennis Rice, Charles Lovett, Larry Bailey, and Kenneth Como — drove a white van to a Hawthorne, California Western Surplus Store. Once inside the store, the group brandished guns and ordered the store patrons and clerks to lie on the ground. They then took 143 rifles from the premises, loading them into their van, while a store clerk tripped the silent alarm. According to police officers, the group then debated whether to kill all of those in the store.\\n\\nPolice alleged the group\\'s plan was to hijack a Boeing 747 and threaten to kill one passenger every hour until Manson and fellow Family members were released from prison. When a police squad car arrived, Share opened fire on the vehicle, shattering the windshield. As more squad cars arrived, they blocked the van from fleeing the scene, spraying it with over 50 bullets; the Family members fired nearly 20 rounds at the officers. When police finally gained control of the scene and apprehended the group, Mary Brunner, Catherine Share, and Larry Bailey were injured.\\n\\nBrunner was convicted and received a sentence of 20 years to life, She was sent to the California Institution for Women, where Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel were serving their sentences for their participation in the Tate-LaBianca murders. Brunner disappeared from the public eye after being paroled in 1977.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Mary Brunner', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11235759'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1123698', 'text': 'End-to-end delay\\n\\nEnd-to-end delay or one-way delay (OWD) refers to the time taken for a packet to be transmitted across a network from source to destination. It is a common term in IP network monitoring, and differs from round-trip time (RTT) in that only path in the one direction from source to destination is measured.\\n\\nSection::::Measurement.\\nThe ping utility measures the RTT, that is, the time to go and come back to a host. Half the RTT is often used as an approximation of OWD but this assumes that the forward and back paths are the same in terms of congestion, number of hops, or quality of service (QoS). This is not always a good assumption. To avoid such problems, the OWD may be measured directly.\\n\\nOWDs may be measured between two points \"A\" and \"B\" of an IP network through the use of synchronized clocks; \"A\" records a timestamp on the packet and sends it to \"B\", which notes the receiving time and calculates the OWD as their difference. The transmitted packets need to be identified at source and destination in order to avoid packet loss or packet reordering. However, this method suffers several limitations, such as requiring intensive cooperation between both parties, and the accuracy of the measured delay is subject to the synchronization precision. \\n\\nThe Minimum-Pairs Protocol is an example by which several cooperating entities, \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\", could measure OWDs between one of them and a fourth less cooperative one (e.g., between \"B\" and \"X\").\\n\\nSection::::Delay components.\\nEnd-to-end-delay in networks comes from several sources including transmission delay, propagation delay, processing delay and queuing delay.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'End-to-end delay', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123698'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11237007', 'text': \"Lufthansa Center\\n\\nThe Lufthansa Center is a large building complex in Beijing that opened in 1992.

United. His DC team won the MLS Cup in 2004. He retired from the game in February 2011 after being released by Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the 2010 season.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSection::::Early life and amateur.\\nKovalenko emigrated to the United States in 1992. He graduated from Greece Arcadia High School in Rochester, New York in 1996, and played three years of college soccer at Indiana University from 1996 to 1998, where he helped the Hoosiers win a national championship in 1998, and was named an NCAA first team All-American in the same year. Was long known in college for his powerful headers, which often left opponents stunned and unable to react to deflections from the goalkeeper or posts. Kovalenko often attributed this to his well developed neck muscles that he said were created from doing hundreds of sets of Ukrainian neck-snaps daily prior to his soccer training.\\n\\nSection::::Professional.\\nUpon joining the league, Kovalenko was originally allocated to the Dallas Burn, but the league complied with his demands to play for the Chicago Fire, engineering a trade to the team in exchange for draft picks. Kovalenko appeared infrequently in his rookie year, playing only 291 minutes in 11 games, but managed to score three goals for the team. Kovalenko made an impact another way, breaking the leg, and effectively ending the career, of Dallas Burn defender Brandon Pollard with a dangerous tackle.\\n\\nKovalenko would come into his own as a player in the 2000 season, scoring ten goals and five assists in 31 games for the Fire, as he helped the team to a U.S. Open Cup victory. The next year, he was moved from a forward position to attacking midfield, but continued to catalyze the Fire offense, scoring eight goals and seven assists in 25 games. In 2001, Kovalenko had trouble scoring, registering only one goal with his eight assists, but was still a dangerous offensive player for the team.\\n\\nAfter the 2001 MLS season, Kovalenko played on loan for FC St. Pauli of the German Bundesliga. Following the 2002 season he was traded, largely because of salary cap problems, to D.C. United in exchange for youngster Justin Mapp. Kovalenko immediately established himself with United, scoring six goals in 24 games in his first season with the team. Also, in what seemed like something of a recurring trend, Kovalenko was again involved in a Dallas Burn injury, when another late tackle broke Burn midfielder Ronnie O\\'Brien\\'s leg, causing him to miss most of the regular season. Kovalenko was fined $1,000 and suspended one game for his actions. Kovalenko continued to be a valuable player in central midfield for D.C. United in 2004, registering two goals and ten assists for the team in 25 games. He was ejected from the championship game for a handball, but DC United held on to win. In 2005, despite losing the early part of the season to a broken foot, he tallied four goals and four assists. He left DC United in January 2006, after being unable to agree on salary terms, and returned to Ukraine. He signed a one-year contract with FC Metalurh Zaporizhzhya.\\n\\nIn August 2006, Kovalenko returned to MLS, after his rights were acquired by New York Red Bulls from DC. The fiery Ukrainian\\'s play in the beginning of the 2007 season had New York challenging in the Eastern Conference, however he was sidelined with injury and the team began to struggle. Kovalenko was able to return during the latter part of the season, helping the club clinch a playoff berth. He concluded the season appearing in 19 league matches, registering two goals and one assist. He was traded to Real Salt Lake in February 2008.\\n\\nOn 14 January 2009, Salt Lake traded Kovalenko to Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a draft pick and an undisclosed sum of allocation money.\\n\\nOn 3 December 2010, LA Galaxy announced Kovalenko\\'s contract would not be renewed for the 2011 MLS season. Kovalenko elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a Major League Soccer free agent when he was not selected by any club.\\n\\nHaving been unable to secure a spot on a professional roster for the upcoming season, Kovalenko confirmed his retirement in an interview on 14 February 2011.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Dema Kovalenko', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1125115'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'tRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11255090', 'text': \"St Peter's School, Huntingdon\\n\\nSt Peter's is a secondary school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.

Imperial served a number of cities in Southern California and for a brief period several cities in Arizona.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nImperial was founded as Visco Flying Service in 1964, but later the scheduled passenger service portion of the company changed its name to Imperial Airlines. Visco Flying Service continued to operate as a crop dusting service in the Imperial Valley, for a number of years utilizing Stearman bi-wing biplane aircraft and later added helicopter aerial application as well as a turboprop powered mono-wing crop dusting aircraft. Imperial\\'s passenger carrying operations were operated under FAR135 that initially focused on services from its home base at Imperial County Airport (IPL) in El Centro, CA to San Diego\\'s Lindbergh Field (SAN).\\n\\nOn January 8, 1968, at 10:40\\xa0a.m. an Imperial Beech E18S flown by a single pilot with three passengers aboard crashed shortly after take-off from Lindbergh Field when an engine failed and the pilot was unable to control the aircraft. One passenger survived the accident with serious injuries, according to the NTSB report, LAX68A0065.\\n\\nImperial acquired a Beechcraft Queen Air 65-B80, carrying passengers between the Imperial Valley and San Diego in daily, frequent service. Up to eleven passengers could be accommodated in modest seating that included the co-pilot seat, as the airline operated with a single-pilot only, at that time permitted by the FARs.\\n\\nIn a brief alliance with Borrego Springs, CA based Sun Aire Lines in the mid-1970s a Swearingen Metroliner \"Metro II\" turboprop was placed on the route. The arrangement proved problematic and the two lines went their separate ways, with the high-time Queen Air pressed back into service between Imperial and San Diego. By 1976 there were five or six round trips flown Monday through Friday, none on the weekends, the first departing Imperial at 6 a.m. on the 36-minute flight, with service ending each night just before 8 p.m. back in the \"Valley.\"\\n\\nIn mid-1978 discussions resulted in the airline being sold by James K Vedder to a group of investors from the San Diego area who believed that the deregulated airline environment would provide opportunities not before possible. Soon the lone Queen Air was retired, replaced by four twin engine Cessna 402 prop aircraft and a single twin engine Cessna 404. The route system immediately expanded to Yuma and Phoenix as well as Los Angeles International. About 1980 the airline moved its headquarters to McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California. Later the airline acquired the larger Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante and Short 360 turboprop aircraft for its routes along the southern California coastal corridor in addition to Swearingen Metroliner turboprops and smaller Cessna prop aircraft. For most of the early 1980s, the airline operated flights between San Diego International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport at thirty minutes intervals throughout the day. By 1986 the airline was suffering the effects of increased competition and it ceased operations in January of that year.\\n\\nNonstop service between the Imperial - San Diego city pair no longer exists. For several years circa 2015 SeaPort Airlines utilized the single engine turboprop Cessna Caravan 208 configured with nine seats and provided infrequent service. SeaPort left the market after a short period of operation.\\n\\nSection::::Destinations in 1979.\\nAccording to the airline\\'s system timetable, Imperial was serving the following destinations in Arizona and California in September 1979:\\n\\n\\nImperial flew between LAX and El Centro in 1967/1978 plus I was the travel manager at Mattel and our execs flew to our plant in Mexico via Imperial Airways.\\n\\nSection::::Destinations in 1984.\\nAccording to the airline\\'s route map, Imperial was serving the following destinations in California in September 1984:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Aircraft.\\nImperial was operating a mix of Swearingen Metroliner and Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante turboprops as well as smaller Cessna 402 and Cessna 404 prop aircraft during the early 1980s and had earlier operated Beech 18 prop aircraft.

White plays in hypermodern style, attacking the center from the flanks with pieces rather than occupying it with pawns. These openings are played often, and 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 trail only 1.e4 and 1.d4 in popularity as opening moves.\\n\\nSection::::Classification.\\nIn addition, some flank openings that are considered irregular:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Zukertort Opening (1.Nf3).\\nIf White opens with 1.Nf3, the game often becomes one of the d4 openings (closed games or semi-closed games) by a different move order (this is called \"transposition\"), but unique openings such as the Réti and King\\'s Indian Attack are also common. The Réti itself is characterized by White playing 1.Nf3, fianchettoing one or both bishops, and not playing an early d4 (which would generally transpose into one of the 1.d4 openings).\\n\\nThe King\\'s Indian Attack (KIA) is a system of development that White may use in reply to almost any Black opening moves.\\nThe characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although these moves may be played in many different orders. In fact, the KIA is probably most often reached after 1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the Caro-Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games which usually come after 1.e4 e5.\\nIts greatest appeal may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.\\n\\nSection::::English Opening (1.c4).\\nThe English also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent character as well including symmetrical variations (1.c4 c5) and the Sicilian Defense in reverse (1.c4 e5).\\n\\nSection::::Bird\\'s Opening (1.f4).\\nWith Bird\\'s Opening White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square. The opening can resemble a Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5!?

Customers entered codes found on specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products on a website. Codes could also be entered \"on the go\" by texting them from a cell phone. These codes were converted into virtual \"points\" which could in turn be redeemed by members for various prizes or sweepstakes entries. The number of points from each product depended on the brand as well as the item itself.\\n\\nThe program was launched in late February 2006, and ended in late June 2017. By November 2006, over a million prizes had been redeemed. The program had since been extended annually since its inception, but terminated on June 30, 2017. Any points left over from one year by one member carried over into the next, provided the member had accrued or debited points within a 90-day period. Current members had from late March to late June 2017 to redeem any points accumulated over the years. Leftover points were then donated to charity. In September 2013, the My Coke Rewards Beta was launched. The new system which ran on the same website, but with /beta after the .com on the address, used social media challenges and My Coke Rewards codes to gain \"status\" points to level up, with +5 status points just by creating an account. The levels were bronze, silver, and gold, which replaced the test phase levels of Red, Gold, and Twilight, and points or status were rewarded when a user leveled up. The \"status\" points were discontinued in mid-June 2016. The program ended in late June 2017.\\n\\nSection::::Limitations.\\nThe program always featured limits on the number of codes and points that could be redeemed at one time. Before February 17, 2009, members were limited to entering 10 codes per day, regardless of the number of points that this represented. Members who entered 10 codes from 32-can packages could, under this system, earn a total of 250 points per day, or 1,750 per week. This represented the maximum rate at which points could be accrued without the use of bonus points and similar promotions.\\n\\nIn February 2009, this system was changed. Up until mid-to-late January 2015, members had been limited to entering 100 points per week (through mid-to-late March 2017, 75), regardless of the number of codes redeemed per day (before that, the limit was 120 to early January 2014). Bonus points and promotional offers such as “Double Points Days” were still not subject to this weekly limit. My Coke Rewards had a meter that tells the member how many points they earned during the current week, and whether they have reached the 75 point-per-week limit. Attempts to enter codes that exceed the limit (for example, entering any code which will exceed 75 points) do not cause overflow; the participant was told to “hold on to that code”. (Any bonus points were limited to 2,000 points per week. The limit a member can bank is 10,000 points total weekly.)\\n\\nPlus, the program had an expiration date on the codes that have been entered, or through end of June 2017. Points expired after that date, meaning a customer had to add points to their account or claim a prize by the deadline.\\n\\nIn the UK version of the program, Coke Zone, customers could also avert point expiration by simply logging on to the website. Their codes are issued on a time-limited basis and expire at the end of the month containing the best before date of the relevant product. This program ended on 15 October 2013, and all points earned were voided at 11:59 pm on that date.\\n\\nSection::::Code reuse.\\nThere were two types of codes: single-use and multi-use codes. Single-use codes like those found on Coke products contained a mix of letters and numbers. These codes could only be used once; if they have been entered in any account they will not work again. By contrast, multi-use codes were identified by being all numeric and could be entered by multiple users. The multi-use codes all started with the digits 10008. They have been distributed through email, including during the 2006 Christmas holiday season, as well as through direct mail and print advertising campaigns in various magazines and other publications. Both Blockbuster and Disney (with \"Pirates of the Caribbean\") have participated in such special promotions.\\n\\nSection::::Controversy.\\nThe program was one of several marketing campaigns that have come under fire from the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group interested in regulating how food products are marketed to children. Coca-Cola\\'s online marketing techniques were included in a 98-page report issued in May 2007 by the center and the American University called \"Interactive Food & Beverage Marketing: Targeting Children and Youth\" which criticized the program for collecting personal information from children and for promoting obesity.\\n\\nChildhood obesity was also a concern for weight-loss instructor Julia Griggs Havey who sued Coca-Cola over the program in 2006, but dropped her lawsuit a few weeks later. The lawsuit was dropped for the specific reason of it being frivolous, since there was a misinterpretation as to what was required of a user in order to accumulate Coke points and obtain the currently available reward prizes. The first assumption—that those who have Coke codes must purchase the product in order to redeem them—was shown to be untrue, as Coke stated they took into consideration that users may obtain codes from others. Second, it was pointed out that the Coca-Cola Company has other products besides Coca-Cola, including Minute Maid juice, Powerade, Powerade Zero and Dasani water, for those who do not wish to consume high amounts of high-fructose corn syrup or caffeine. Additionally, many grocery stores and discount stores offer Coca-Cola products (often imported) that are sweetened with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.\\n\\nSome customers further accused Coca-Cola of utilizing \"bait-and-switch\" tactics in the program. They claim that the prizes for which they had been saving are either constantly out of stock or are no longer available. Some items experienced steep unexpected price increases, as well; for example the coupons for a free 20 ounce bottle of Coke increased 67% (from 24 points to 40), a $75 Blockbuster gift card which used to cost 722 points went up to 1,020 points (a 41% increase) before being discontinued, a single Napster download went from 35 to 70 points from 2010 to 2011 (and 10 from 350 to 700, a 100% increase), and the price of a GPX docking station went up from 975 points to 1,820 (an 87% increase). These increases took place at the same time as Coca-Cola was taking drastic measures to decrease the number of points awarded (through its February 2009 rule changes which reduced the maximum number of points from 1,750 per week to 75 through 22 March 2017).\\n\\nFor its part, Coca-Cola maintained that all prizes in the My Coke Rewards program are available \"while supplies last,\" and that there was no guarantee expressed or intended that a given prize would either continue to be offered or continue to be offered at the same price.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'My Coke Rewards', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11275110'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11275483', 'text': 'JISD\\n\\nJISD can refer to:\\n', 'title': 'JISD', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11275483'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11279707', 'text': 'Whispering Jack\\n\\nWhispering Jack is the twelfth studio album by Australian adult contemporary pop singer John Farnham. It was produced by Ross Fraser, and released on 20 October 1986, which peaked at #1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Album Charts. \"Whispering Jack\" has become the second best-selling-album in Australia, behind Meatloaf\\'s album \"Bat Out of Hell\", and the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian artist - 24x platinum indicating sales of over 1.68 million copies sold. It spent 25 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the Album Charts during 1986–1987, it was awarded the 1987 ARIA Award for \"Album of the Year\", and was the best charting album for the decade of the 1980s in Australia. It was the first Australian-made album to be released on Compact Disc within Australia. One of Farnham\\'s biggest hits, \"You\\'re the Voice\" was issued as the lead single from this album and peaked at No. 1 on the Kent Music Report Singles Charts.\\n\\nPrior to this album, Farnham\\'s career had stalled after being recruited and then leaving as lead singer of Australia\\'s Little River Band. Farnham\\'s manager, Glenn Wheatley, mortgaged his home to raise funds for the recording of this album. After initial reluctance by major Australian radio stations to play the lead single, \"You\\'re the Voice\", public demand became overwhelming and they relented. The song became one of the standout Number One songs on the Australian Charts of the 1980s and still remains a staple of Australian Radio. \"Whispering Jack\" restarted Farnham\\'s career and kept it rolling across two more decades. On 21 November 2006, \"Whispering Jack\" was re-released to celebrate its 20th Anniversary, which came with a bonus track, an extended studio version of \"Pressure Down\" and with a DVD of the edited 1987 \"Whispering Jack Live in Concert\" televised performance.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nJohn Farnham had been a teen pop idol during the late 1960s and 1970s billed then as \"Johnny\". He met Glenn Wheatley, who was bass guitarist of rock group The Masters Apprentices, when both acts were managed by Darryl Sambell. From the mid-1970s, Farnham had moved into television, stage and cabaret entertainment. Wheatley, who was already managing Little River Band (LRB), signed Farnham to his company in 1980. They decided Farnham\\'s comeback single would be a reworking of The Beatles\\' \"Help!\", which was produced by LRB\\'s Graeham Goble, it peaked at No. 8 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Farnham was utilising a more adult contemporary pop style and the associated album, \"Uncovered\", was also produced by Goble, which peaked at No. 20 on the Kent Music Report Album Charts. The B-side of \"Help\" was Farnham\\'s song writing effort, \"Jillie\\'s Song\", co-written with Goble. In recording the album, Farnham\\'s studio band included guitarist Tommy Emmanuel (ex-Southern Star Band), keyboardist Mal Logan (ex-Renée Geyer Band, LRB), drummer Derek Pellicci (LRB) and bass guitarist Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain). They became his tour band until Logan and Pellicci returned to their LRB commitments and were replaced by Sam McNally and David Jones respectively. Three other solo singles followed in 1981 but none charted into the Top 50. In February 1982, after Glenn Shorrock had departed Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist with recommendations by Goble and Wheatley.\\n\\nIn 1985, Farnham had started collecting a songlist for a future solo album while still in Little River Band, he finished his vocals for their album, \"No Reins\", and left the band late that year. Farnham\\'s first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with the John Farnham Band consisting of Brett Garsed on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar and Derek Pellicci, formerly of Little River Band, on drums. In early 1986, sound engineer Ross Fraser suggested to Wheatley that it was time to start working on the solo album. Wheatley searched vainly for a producer and record label willing to work with Farnham, Fraser took on the producer role and Wheatley provided financial support after mortgaging his house.\\n\\nWhilst visiting a jazz club in the US, Farnham was mistakenly introduced as Jack Phantom, and when he subsequently provided a running commentary for a local pool game he named himself Whispering Jack Phantom after the \"Pot Black\" commentator \\'Whispering\\' Ted Lowe. Farnham\\'s work for the album, \"Whispering Jack\", included expanding his song list with Fraser\\'s advice. \"A Touch of Paradise\" was co-written by Gulliver Smith of Company Caine and Mondo Rock\\'s Ross Wilson, while \"Pressure Down\" was provided by Harry Bogdanovs. Two weeks before the album was due to be recorded a demo tape arrived from London with similar material to \"Pressure Down\", Farnham and Fraser listened to the demo of \"You\\'re the Voice\" and knew they had found a once-in-a-lifetime song. Another song on offer was \"We Built This City\" but Farnham knocked it back, it was later recorded by US band Starship.\\n\\nInitially, public interest in the re-branded former teen-idol was difficult to cultivate, and radio stations refused to play Farnham\\'s album. Things however started to change after Sydney radio station 2Day FM played its first single, \"You\\'re the Voice\", which was released in September 1986. Henceforth, radio stations began receiving requests for the song. Its television debut was on \"Hey Hey Its Saturday\" with Skyhook\\'s Greg Macainsh providing bass guitar. \"You\\'re the Voice,\" peaked at No. 1 in Sweden and Australia, as well as being a Top Ten hit in some European countries: No. 3 in Switzerland, No. 6 in the UK, and No. 6 in Austria. The song was written by Andy Qunta (ex-Icehouse), Keith Reid (Procol Harum), Maggie Ryder and Chris Thompson (ex-Manfred Mann\\'s Earth Band).\\n\\n\"Whispering Jack\", released in October, became the highest-selling album by an Australian act in Australia, and peaked at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Album Charts for a total of 25 weeks. As of 2006, it was 24x platinum indicating sales of over 1.68 million units in Australia alone. The album was released internationally on RCA/BMG and peaked at No. 1 in Sweden, No. 3 in Austria, and Top 20 in Norway. In August 1988 it returned to the Australian Top Ten. Other Australian singles were December\\'s \"Pressure Down\", which peaked at No. 4, February 1987\\'s \"Touch of Paradise\" and September\\'s \"Reasons\".\\n\\nFarnham followed with Jack\\'s Back Tour, an initial itinerary of eleven performances was thought to be enough considering they were up against tours by Michael Jackson and Billy Joel, but after high ticket sales, it was extended by eight more shows and use of larger venues. At that time, Jack\\'s Back Tour was the highest-grossing tour by an Australian act. John Farnham Band now consisted of Garsed on lead guitar, David Hirschfelder on keyboards (ex-Little River Band), Macainsh on bass and Angus Burchill on drums. Farnham won six of the inaugural 1987 Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Awards for \\'Album of the Year\\', \\'Single of the Year\\', \\'Highest Selling Album\\', \\'Highest Selling Single\\', \\'Best Male Artist\\' and \\'Best Adult Contemporary Album\\'. On 19 July 1987, TV series \"Countdown\" broadcast its last show, the 1986 with Farnham winning the \\'Best Album Award\\' for \"Whispering Jack\". In October 2010, \"Whispering Jack\" (1986) was listed in the book, \"100 Best Australian Albums\".\\n\\nIn 2011 Farnham announced a national tour to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"Whispering Jack\", including the album being performed in its entirety in track order.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Whispering Jack Live.\\nFollowing the initial success of the album, a series of concerts was performed around Australia in 1987. One such performance was recorded at the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre, and broadcast on Network Ten. A full version of the concert was also released to video in the same year.\\n\\nSection::::20th Anniversary Edition Track listing.\\nDisc One (CD)\\nDisc Two (\"Whispering Jack Live in Concert\" DVD) (NOTE: The DVD used the edited version originally broadcast on television in 1987.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Whispering Jack', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11279707'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11279990', 'text': 'RAF Weston Zoyland\\n\\nRAF Westonzoyland is one of the country\\'s oldest airfields being established in the early 1920s. Somerset, England. The airfield is located approximately east-southeast of Bridgwater; about west-southwest of London\\n\\nEstablished in 1925 with summer camps which would last from May until September each year, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. During the war it was used primarily as an army co-operation airfield but several squadrons were based there with a variety of aircraft. Spitfires, Hurricanes and Mosquito\\'s. Briefly - the early Meteor jets were based before flying off to RAF CULMHEAD in East Devon. There after they were based at RAF MANSTON with the mission of shooting down the V1 rockets. After being stood down in 1947 it was recommissioned in 1952 as a Meteor jet training base as a result of the Korean War. It was home to 209 AFS where Lord Craig and Sir Patrick Hine were based before going to become Air Chief Marshals of the RAF.\\n\\nToday the remains of the airfield are a mixture of farmland and a base for Civil Air Patrol activities.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nWestonzoyland airfield originated in the mid-1920s as a landing ground, being in use by 1926 for drogue tugs using the anti-aircraft gunnery range off Watchet in the Bristol Channel. At first, it was no more than an extended cow pasture, subject only to seasonal use until the Second World War loomed, when the site was occupied on a permanent basis. During the pre-war years, buildings were erected piecemeal as required and the landing ground area gradually enlarged but, with the fall of France, Westonzoyland was no longer a backwater airfield.\\n\\nTo obtain the necessary amount of land for siting runways of sufficient length, the A372 to Othery was closed and diverted south on a former minor road.\\n\\nIn 1942, the Air Ministry decided to upgrade the airfield to bomber standard and, early in 1943, work began on laying concrete runways and the perimeter track to the Class A airfield standard, the main feature of which was a set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern.\\n\\nThe airfield runways were a main of 5.775\\xa0ft at 11/29, and ancillaries of 3,564\\xa0ft at 05/23 and 4,101\\xa0ft at 16/34. Two hardstands were of 150\\xa0ft diameter pans and there were 33 loops connecting to an enclosing perimeter track, of a standard width of 50 feet.\\n\\nSection::::USAAF use.\\nWestonzoyland was known as USAAF Station AAF-447 for security reasons during the war while under American control, and by which it was referred to instead of location. Its Station-ID was \"ZW\".\\n\\nSection::::442nd Troop Carrier Group.\\nThere was a long delay before the allocated unit, the 442d Troop Carrier Group arrived after D-Day from RAF Fulbeck. Its operational squadrons were:\\n\\nThe 442d was a group of Ninth Air Force\\'s 50th Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command. The group moved in October 1944 to its Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) Peray Airfield (ALG A-44) France.\\n\\nSection::::Subsequent RAF use.\\nThe station had never been officially transferred from the RAF and the anti-aircraft support units were quick to return. Several Squadrons were based at Westonzoyland, but the longest stay was by No. 16 Squadron RAF who flew Westland Lysanders, and later with the North American Mustang. Later Supermarine Spitfires became a common sight being flown by No. 19 Squadron RAF and others. Nos. 286 and 587 Squadrons with their mixture of Miles Martinets, Hawker Hurricanes, Airspeed Oxfords, Vultee A-31 Vengeances and North American Harvards remained in residence until near the end of hostilities. 587 Squadron was formed at RAF Westonzoyland, on 1 December 1943, from 1600 Flight, 1601 Flight and 1625 Flight for anti-aircraft co-operation duties over Wales and the south east of England. It operated a variety of aircraft in this role. Due to the ongoing training requirement the squadron was not disbanded at the end of the war and it moved to RAF Tangmere on 1 June 1946 to cover the south coast, but was disbanded shortly afterwards on 15 June 1946.\\n\\nFour fighter squadrons came and departed during the months following the end of the war in Europe, but by 1947 the station was reduced to care and maintenance.\\n\\nThere was virtually no further flying at Westonzoyland until the summer of 1952 when, to meet the Soviet threat, an increase in the RAF\\'s strength and a demand for more aircrews found Meteors and Vampires operating in a training role.\\n\\nEnglish Electric Canberra squadrons were present during the mid-1950s when Westonzoyland was used as a work-up station prior to overseas assignments. By 1958 the station was once more deserted of aircraft and, although retained by the Air Ministry for another ten years, it never reopened for military flying. Some of these Canberras flew out to Australia to take part in the British atomic tests at Maralinga.\\n\\nSection::::Current use.\\nUpon its release from military use, in the 1960s, the A372 was restored to near its original route by utilising a considerable length of the former main runway. The former secondary runways are clearly evident in aerial photography, although most of the concrete has been removed. The former perimeter track has been reduced to a single-lane agricultural road with the pan and loop dispersal hardstands all being removed. Several derelict buildings still remain, including the control tower and a large cluster to the northwest of the perimeter, including the base of what appears to be the remains of two large J-Type hangars and a support site. No evidence of the Pierced Steel Planking extensions to the runways remain nor of an ammunition dump.\\n\\nIn the late 1960s, local people used the station\\'s squash courts.\\n\\nAlthough much of the airfield is no longer usable for aviation purposes, Westonzoyland Airfield is in use for Microlights which uses the northwest half of the 16/34 runway, and is a base for the Sky Watch Civil Air Patrol (SWCAP).\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'RAF Weston Zoyland', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11279990'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11280395', 'text': 'List of Spanish films before 1930\\n\\nA list of the earliest films produced in the Cinema of Spain, ordered by year of release from 1897 to 1929.

The most popular ad blocking tools are browser extensions. Other methods are also available.\\n\\nSection::::Technologies and native countermeasures.\\nOnline advertising exists in a variety of forms, including web banners, pictures, animations, embedded audio and video, text, or pop-up windows, and can employ audio and video autoplay. All browsers offer some ways to remove or alter advertisements: either by targeting technologies that are used to deliver ads (such as embedded content delivered through browser plug-ins or via HTML5), targeting URLs that are the source of ads, or targeting behaviors characteristic to ads (such as the use of HTML5 autoplay of both audio and video).\\n\\nSection::::Reasons for blocking ads.\\nFrom the standpoint of an Internet user, there are various fundamental reasons why one would want to use ad blocking, in addition to not being manipulated by brands: \\nPublishers and their representative trade bodies, on the other hand, argue that web ads provide revenue to website owners, which enable the website owners to create or otherwise purchase content for the website. Publishers claim that the prevalent use of ad blocking software and devices could adversely affect website owner revenue and thus in turn lower the availability of free content on websites.\\n\\nSection::::Benefits.\\nFor users, the benefits of ad blocking software include quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions, lower resource waste (bandwidth, CPU, memory, etc.), and privacy benefits gained through the exclusion of the tracking and profiling systems of ad delivery platforms. Blocking ads can also save substantial amounts of electrical energy and lower users\\' power bills.\\n\\nSection::::User experience.\\nAd blocking software may have other benefits to users\\' quality of life, as it decreases Internet users\\' exposure to advertising and marketing industries, which promote the purchase of numerous consumer products and services that are potentially harmful or unhealthy and on creating the urge to buy immediately.\\n\\nUnwanted advertising can also harm the advertisers themselves if users become annoyed by the ads. Irritated users might make a conscious effort to avoid the goods and services of firms which are using annoying \"pop-up\" ads which block the Web content the user is trying to view. For users not interested in making purchases, the blocking of ads can also save time. Any ad that appears on a website exerts a toll on the user\\'s \"attention budget\", since each ad enters the user\\'s field of view and must either be consciously ignored or closed, or dealt with in some other way. A user who is strongly focused on reading solely the content that they are seeking, likely has no desire to be diverted by advertisements that seek to sell unneeded or unwanted goods and services. In contrast, users who are actively seeking items to purchase, might appreciate advertising, in particular targeted ads.\\n\\nSection::::Security.\\nAnother important aspect is improving security; online advertising subjects users to a higher risk of infecting their devices with computer viruses than surfing pornography websites. In a high-profile case, malware was distributed through advertisements provided to YouTube by a malicious customer of Google\\'s Doubleclick. In August 2015, a 0-day exploit in the Firefox browser was discovered in an advertisement on a website. When Forbes required users to disable ad blocking before viewing their website, those users were immediately served with pop-under malware. The Australian Signals Directorate recommends individuals and organizations block advertisements to improve their information security posture and mitigate potential malvertising attacks and machine compromise. The information security firm Webroot also note employing ad blockers provide effective countermeasures against malvertising campaigns for less technically-sophisticated computer users.\\n\\nSection::::Monetary.\\nAd blocking can also save money for the user. If a user\\'s personal time is worth one dollar per minute, and if unsolicited advertising adds an extra minute to the time that the user requires for reading the webpage (i.e. the user must manually identify the ads as ads, and then click to close them, or use other techniques to either deal with them, all of which tax the user\\'s intellectual focus in some way), then the user has effectively lost one dollar of time in order to deal with ads that might generate a few fractional pennies of display-ad revenue for the website owner. The problem of lost time can rapidly spiral out of control if malware accompanies the ads.\\n\\nAd blocking also reduces page load time and saves bandwidth for the users. Users who pay for total transferred bandwidth (\"capped\" or pay-for-usage connections) including most mobile users worldwide, have a direct financial benefit from filtering an ad before it is loaded. Analysis of the 200 most popular news sites (as ranked by Alexa) in 2015 showed that Mozilla Firefox Tracking Protection lead to 39% reduction in data usage and 44% median reduction in page load time. According to research performed by The New York Times, ad blockers reduced data consumption and sped up load time by more than half on 50 news sites, including their own. Journalists concluded that \"visiting the home page of Boston.com (the site with most ad data in the study) every day for a month would cost the equivalent of about $9.50 in data usage just for the ads\". Streaming audio and video, even if they are not presented to the user interface, can rapidly consume gigabytes of transfer especially on a faster 4G connection. Even fixed connections are often subject to usage limits, especially the faster connections (100Mbit/s and up) which can quickly saturate a network if filled by streaming media. It is a known problem with most web browsers, including Firefox, that restoring sessions often plays multiple embedded ads at once.\\n\\nSection::::Popularity.\\nUse of mobile and desktop ad blocking software designed to remove traditional advertising grew by 41% worldwide and by 48% in the U.S. between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015. As of Q2 2015, 45 million Americans were using ad blockers. In a survey research study released Q2 2016, MetaFacts reported 72 million Americans, 12.8 million adults in the UK, and 13.2 million adults in France were using ad blockers on their PCs, smartphones, or tablet computers. In March 2016, the Internet Advertising Bureau reported that UK adblocking was already at 22% among people over 18 years old.\\n\\nSection::::Methods.\\nOne method of filtering is simply to block (or prevent autoplay of) Flash animation or image loading or Microsoft Windows audio and video files. This can be done in most browsers easily and also improves security and privacy. This crude technological method is refined by numerous browser extensions. Every web browser handles this task differently, but, in general, one alters the options, preferences or application extensions to filter specific media types. An additional add-on is usually required to differentiate between ads and non-ads using the same technology, or between wanted and unwanted ads or behaviors.\\n\\nThe more advanced ad blocking filter software allow fine-grained control of advertisements through features such as blacklists, whitelists, and regular expression filters. Certain security features also have the effect of disabling some ads. Some antivirus software can act as an ad blocker. Filtering by intermediaries such as ISP providers or national governments is increasingly common.\\n\\nSection::::Browser integration.\\nAs of 2015, many web browsers block unsolicited pop-up ads automatically. Current versions of Konqueror and Internet Explorer also include content filtering support. Content filtering can be added to Firefox, Chromium-based browsers, Opera, Safari, and other browsers with extensions such as AdBlock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin, and a number of sources provide regularly updated filter lists. Adblock Plus (provided by the German software house Eyeo GmbH) is included in the freeware browser Maxthon from the People\\'s Republic of China by default. Another method for filtering advertisements uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules to hide specific HTML and XHTML elements.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2018, Google confirmed that the built-in ad blocker for the Chrome/Chromium browsers would go live on the 15th of February: this ad blocker only blocks certain ads as specified by the Better Ads Standard (defined by the Coalition for Better Ads®, in which Google itself is a board member). This built-in ad blocking mechanism is disputed because it could unfairly benefit Google\\'s advertising itself.\\n\\nSection::::External programs.\\nA number of external software applications offer ad filtering as a primary or additional feature. A traditional solution is to customize an HTTP proxy (or web proxy) to filter content. These programs work by caching and filtering content before it is displayed in a user\\'s browser. This provides an opportunity to remove not only ads but also content which may be offensive, inappropriate, or even malicious (Drive-by download). Popular proxy software which blocks content effectively include Netnanny, Privoxy, Squid, and some content-control software. The main advantage of the method is freedom from implementation limitations (browser, working techniques) and centralization of control (the proxy can be used by many users). Proxies are very good at filtering ads, but they have several limitations compared to browser-based solutions. For proxies, it is difficult to filter Transport Layer Security (SSL) (codice_1) traffic and full webpage context is not available to the filter. As well, proxies find it difficult to filter JavaScript-generated ad content.\\n\\nSection::::Hosts file and DNS manipulation.\\nMost operating systems, even those which are aware of the Domain Name System (DNS), still offer backward compatibility with a locally administered list of foreign hosts. This configuration, for historical reasons, is stored in a flat text file that by default contains very few hostnames and their associated IP addresses. Editing this hosts file is simple and effective because most DNS clients will read the local hosts file before querying a remote DNS server. Storing black-hole entries in the hosts file prevents the browser from accessing an ad server by manipulating the name resolution of the ad server to a local or nonexistent IP address (codice_2 or codice_3 are typically used for IPv4 addresses). While simple to implement, these methods can be circumvented by advertisers, either by hard-coding the IP address of the server that hosts the ads (this, in its turn, can be worked around by changing the local routing table by using for example iptables or other blocking firewalls), or by loading the advertisements from the same server that serves the main content; blocking name resolution of this server would also block the useful content of the site.\\n\\nUsing a DNS sinkhole by manipulating the hosts file exploits the fact that most operating systems store a file with IP address, domain name pairs which is consulted by most browsers before using a DNS server to look up a domain name. By assigning the loopback address to each known ad server, the user directs traffic intended to reach each ad server to the local machine or to a virtual black hole of /dev/null or bit bucket.\\n\\nSection::::DNS filtering.\\nAdvertising can be blocked by using a DNS server which is configured to block access to domains or hostnames which are known to serve ads by spoofing the address. Users can choose to use an already modified DNS server or set up a dedicated device such as a Raspberry Pi themselves. Manipulating DNS is a widely employed method to manipulate what the end user sees from the Internet but can also be deployed locally for personal purposes. China runs its own root DNS and the EU has considered the same. Google has required their Google Public DNS be used for some applications on its Android devices. Accordingly, DNS addresses / domains used for advertising may be extremely vulnerable to a broad form of ad substitution whereby a domain that serves ads is entirely swapped out with one serving more local ads to some subset of users. This is especially likely in countries, notably Russia, India and China, where advertisers often refuse to pay for clicks or page views. DNS-level blocking of domains for non-commercial reasons is already common in China.\\n\\nSection::::Recursive Local VPN.\\nOn Android, apps can run a local VPN connection with its own host filtering ability and DNS address without requiring root access. This approach allows adblocking app to download adblocking host files and use them to filter out ad networks throughout the device. Blokada, DNS66, AdGuard are few of the popular apps which accomplish adblocking without root permission. The adblocking is only active when the local VPN is turned on, and it completely stops when the VPN connection is disconnected. The convenience makes it easy to access content blocked by anti-adblock scripts.\\n\\nThis approach optimizes battery usage, reduces internet slowdown caused by using external DNS or VPN adblocking and needs overall less configuration.\\n\\nSection::::Hardware devices.\\nDevices such as AdTrap use hardware to block Internet advertising. Based on reviews of AdTrap, this device uses a Linux Kernel running a version of PrivProxy to block ads from video streaming, music streaming, and any web browser. Another such solution is provided for network-level ad blocking for telcos by Israeli startup Shine.\\n\\nSection::::By external parties and internet providers.\\nInternet providers, especially mobile operators, frequently offer proxies designed to reduce network traffic. Even when not targeted specifically at ad filtering, these proxy-based arrangements will block many types of advertisements that are too large or bandwidth-consuming, or that are otherwise deemed unsuited for the specific internet connection or target device. Many internet operators block some form of advertisements while at the same time injecting their own ads promoting their services and specials.\\n\\nSection::::Economic consequences for online business.\\nSome content providers have argued that widespread ad blocking results in decreased revenue to a website sustained by advertisements and e-commerce-based businesses, where this blocking can be detected. Some have argued that since advertisers are ultimately paying for ads to increase their own revenues, eliminating ad blocking would only dilute the value per impression and drive down the price of advertising, arguing that like click fraud, impressions served to users who use ad blockers are of little to no value to advertisers. Consequently, they argue, eliminating ad blocking would not increase overall ad revenue to content providers in the long run.\\n\\nSection::::Response from publishers.\\nSection::::Countermeasures.\\nSome websites have taken countermeasures against ad blocking software, such as attempting to detect the presence of ad blockers and informing users of their views, or outright preventing users from accessing the content unless they disable the ad blocking software, whitelist the website, or buy an \"ad-removal pass\". There have been several arguments supporting and opposing the assertion that blocking ads is wrong.\\n\\nSome publisher companies have taken steps to protect their rights to conduct their business according to prevailing law.\\nIt has been suggested that in the European Union, the practice of websites scanning for ad blocking software may run afoul of the E-Privacy Directive. This claim was further validated by IAB Europe\\'s guidelines released in June 2016 stating that there indeed may be a legal issue in ad blocker detection. While some anti-blocking stakeholders have tried to refute this it seems safe to assume that Publishers should follow the guidelines provided by the main Publisher lobby IAB. The joint effort announced by IAB Sweden prior to IAB Europe\\'s guideline on the matter never materialized, and would have most likely been found against European anti-competition laws if it did.\\n\\nIn August 2017, a vendor of such counter-measures issued a demand under section 1201 of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to demand the removal of a domain name associated with their service from an ad-blocking filter list. The vendor argued that the domain constituted a component of a technological protection measure designed to protect a copyrighted work, and thus made it a violation of anti-circumvention law to frustrate access to it.\\n\\nSection::::Alternatives.\\nAs of 2015, advertisers and marketers look to involve their brands directly into the entertainment with native advertising and product placement (also known as brand integration or embedded marketing). An example of product placement would be for a soft drink manufacturer to pay a reality TV show producer to have the show\\'s cast and host appear onscreen holding cans of the soft drink. Another common product placement is for an automotive manufacturer to give free cars to the producers of a TV show, in return for the show\\'s producer depicting characters using these vehicles during the show.\\n\\nSome digital publications turned to their customers for help. For example, the Guardian is asking its readers for donations to help offset falling advertising revenue. According to the newspaper\\'s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, the newspaper gets about the same amount of money from membership and paying readers as it does from advertising. The newspaper considered preventing readers from accessing its content if usage of ad-blocking software becomes widespread, but so far it keeps the content accessible for readers who employ ad-blockers.\\n', 'title': 'Ad blocking', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129601'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '0xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1129627', 'text': 'Gremlin Interactive\\n\\nInfogrames Studios Limited (formerly Gremlin Graphics Software Limited and later Gremlin Interactive Limited) was a British software house based in Sheffield, working mostly in the home computer market.

The decree found a broad response among the workers of the country, though they often had to fight resistance from their factories, which needed them to fill production quotas. In her history of the movement, Lynne Viola writes:\\nThe recruitment drive illustrated the sometimes contradictory nature of the first five-year plan revolution, which aimed for the maximum in economic modernization while at the same time insisting that modernization occur within the parameters of the social and political guidelines of the proletarian dictatorship. The factories were required to increase production while releasing their best workers for participation in the numerous mobilizations of skilled workers for promotion in the bureaucracy, the purge of the state administration, enrollment in higher technical education, and work in the countryside. The consequences of these contradictory demands were frequently inconsistency, disorder, and an uneasy balance between different institutional concerns, revealing a side of Soviet politics lacking unity of purpose and divided by differing interests. In the recruitment of the 25,000ers this meant that ultimately the state had to circumvent factory officialdom and, with the aid of the party organs, appeal directly to workers over the head of resistant factory officials for support in the campaign. And the result was that, in spite of the opposition of factory officials and problems in campaign implementation, the recruitment drive was an enormous success.\\nAs a result, 27,519 people were selected from all over the USSR and sent to work in the kolkhozy.\\n\\nAnalysis of the social structure of 23,409 twenty-five-thousanders who had personal files reveals:\\n\\n\\nIn order to prepare the twenty-five-thousanders for work in the rural areas, the Soviets organized special courses. Some volunteers were sent to sovkhozy for two or three months as interns. Most of the twenty-five-thousanders were sent directly to kolkhozy in the principal cereal regions of the country, such as Ukraine, North Caucasus, Lower and Middle Volga, the Black Earth Region and others.\\n\\nThe twenty-five-thousanders took part in establishing new kolkhozy and in strengthening the weak ones, conducting political, educational and cultural work among the inhabitants of the rural areas. They assisted kolkhozy in organizing stock, strengthening work-discipline and establishing \"correct\" product-distribution. Some of the twenty-five-thousanders were elected board members and chairmen of kolkhozy.\\n\\nHowever, the twenty-five-thousanders encountered fierce resistance from the so-called kulaks, who opposed the socialist re-organization of agriculture.\\n\\nSoviet literature treated the phenomenon of the twenty-five-thousanders extensively.

This syndrome can be classed as one of various hereditary intestinal polyposis syndromes and one of various hamartomatous polyposis syndromes. It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births.\\n\\nSection::::Signs and symptoms.\\nThe risks associated with this syndrome include a strong tendency of developing cancer in a number of parts of the body. While the hamartomatous polyps themselves only have a small malignant potential (<3% - OHCM), patients with the syndrome have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the liver, lungs, breast, ovaries, uterus, testes and other organs. Specifically, it is associated with an increased risk of sex-cord stromal tumor with annular tubules in the ovaries.\\n\\nThe average age of first diagnosis is 23, but the lesions can be identified at birth by an astute pediatrician or family physician. Prior to puberty, the mucocutaneous lesions can be found on the palms and soles. Often the first presentation is a bowel obstruction from an intussusception which is a common cause of mortality; an intussusception is a telescoping of one loop of bowel into another segment.\\n\\nSection::::Pathophysiology.\\nSection::::Genetics.\\nIn 1998, a gene was found to be associated with the mutation. On chromosome 19, the gene known as \"STK11\" (\"LKB1\") is a possible tumor suppressor gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that anyone who has PJS has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their offspring.\\n\\nPeutz–Jeghers syndrome is rare and studies typically include only a small number of patients. Even in those few studies that do contain a large number of patients, the quality of the evidence is limited due to pooling patients from many centers, selection bias (only patients with health problems coming from treatment are included), and historical bias (the patients reported are from a time before advances in the diagnosis of treatment of Peutz–Jeghers syndrome were made). Probably due to this limited evidence base, cancer risk estimates for Peutz–Jeghers syndrome vary from study to study. There is an estimated 18-21% risk of ovarian cancer, 9% risk of endometrial cancer, and 10% risk of cervical cancer, specifically adenoma malignum.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nThe main criteria for clinical diagnosis are:\\n\\nHaving 2 of the 3 listed clinical criteria indicates a positive diagnosis. The oral findings are consistent with other conditions, such as Addison\\'s disease and McCune-Albright syndrome, and these should be included in the differential diagnosis. 90–100% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of PJS have a mutation in the \"STK11/LKB1\" gene. Molecular genetic testing for this mutation is available clinically.\\n\\nSection::::Management.\\nResection of the polyps is required only if serious bleeding or intussusception occurs. Enterotomy is performed for removing large, single nodules. Short lengths of heavily involved intestinal segments can be resected. Colonoscopy can be used to snare the polyps if they are within reach.\\n\\nSection::::Prognosis.\\nMost patients will develop flat, brownish spots (melanotic macules) on the skin, especially on the lips and oral mucosa, during the first year of life, and a patient\\'s first bowel obstruction due to intussusception usually occurs between the ages of six and 18 years. The cumulative lifetime cancer risk begins to rise in middle age. Cumulative risks by age 70 for all cancers, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and pancreatic cancer are 85%, 57%, and 11%, respectively.\\n\\nA 2011 Dutch study followed 133 patients for 14 years. The cumulative risk for cancer was 40% and 76% at ages 40 and 70, respectively. 42 (32%) of the patients died during the study, of which 28 (67%) were cancer related. They died at a median age of 45. Mortality was increased compared with the general population.\\n\\nA family with sinonasal polyposis were followed up for 28 years. Two cases of sinonasal type adenocarcinoma developed. This is a rare cancer. This report suggested that follow up of sinus polyps in this syndrome may be indicated.\\n\\nSection::::Monitoring.\\nSome suggestions for surveillance for cancer include the following:\\n\\nFollow-up care should be supervised by a physician familiar with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. Genetic consultation and counseling as well as urological and gynecological consultations are often needed.\\n\\nSection::::Eponym.\\nFirst described in a published case report in 1921 by Jan Peutz (1886-1957), a Dutch Internist, it was later formalized into the syndrome by American physicians at Boston City Hospital, Harold Joseph Jeghers (1904-1990) and Kermit Harry Katz (1914-2003), and Victor Almon McKusick (1921-2008) in 1949 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Peutz–Jeghers syndrome', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129862'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '1xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11299290', 'text': 'Schisler\\n\\nSchisler is a surname.

It was largely a continuation of the First Sudanese Civil War of 1955 to 1972. Although it originated in southern Sudan, the civil war spread to the Nuba mountains and the Blue Nile. It lasted for 22 years and is one of the longest civil wars on record. The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan six years after the war ended.\\n\\nRoughly two million people died as a result of war, famine and disease caused by the conflict. Four million people in southern Sudan were displaced at least once (and normally repeatedly) during the war. The civilian death toll is one of the highest of any war since World War II and was marked by a large number of human rights violations. These include slavery and mass killings.\\n\\nSection::::Background and Causes.\\nThe Sudanese war is often characterized as a fight between the central government expanding and dominating peoples of the periphery, raising allegations of marginalization. Kingdoms and great powers based along the Nile River have fought against the people of inland Sudan for centuries. Since at least the 18th century, central governments have attempted to regulate and exploit the undeveloped southern and inland Sudan.\\n\\nSome sources describe the conflict as an ethnoreligious one where the Muslim central government\\'s pursuits to impose sharia law on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war. Douglas Johnson has pointed to an exploitative governance as the root cause.\\n\\nWhen the British governed Sudan as a colony they administered the northern and southern provinces separately. The south was held to be more similar to the other east-African colonies — Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda — while northern Sudan was more similar to Arabic-speaking Egypt. Northern Arabs were prevented from holding positions of power in the south with its African traditions, and trade was discouraged between the two areas. However, in 1946, the British gave in to northern pressure to integrate the two areas. Arabic was made the language of administration in the south, and northerners began to hold positions there. The southern elite, trained in English, resented the change as they were kept out of their own government. After decolonization most power was given to the northern elites based in Khartoum, causing unrest in the south. The British moved towards granting Sudan independence, but they failed to give enough power to Southern leaders. Southern Sudanese leaders weren\\'t even invited to negotiations during the transitional period in the 1950s. In the post-colonial government of 1953, the Sudanization Committee only included 6 southern leaders, though there were some 800 available senior administrative positions.\\n\\nThe second war was partially about natural resources. Between the north and the south lie significant oil fields and thus significant foreign interests (the oil revenue is privatized to Western interests as in Nigeria). The north wanted to control these resources because they are situated on the edge of the Sahara desert, which is unsuitable for agricultural development. Oil revenues make up about 70% of Sudan\\'s export earnings, and contribute to the development of the country which, unlike the south, does not depend on international aid. Due to numerous tributaries of the Nile river and heavier precipitation in the south of Sudan they have superior water access and fertile land.\\n\\nThere has also been a significant amount of death from warring tribes in the south. Most of the conflict has been between Nuer and Dinka but other ethnic groups have also been involved. These tribal conflicts have remained after independence. For example, in January 2012 3,000 Murle people were massacred by the Nuer.\\n\\nThe first civil war ended in 1972, with the Addis Ababa Agreement. Part of the agreement gave religious and cultural autonomy to the south.\\n\\nSection::::Civil War.\\nSection::::Before 1985.\\nSection::::Addis Ababa Agreement ended.\\nThe Addis Ababa Accords were incorporated in the Constitution of Sudan; the violation of the agreement led to the second civil war.\\n\\nThe first violations occurred when President Jaafar Nimeiry attempted to take control of oil fields straddling the north-south border. Oil had been discovered in Bentiu in 1978, in southern Kurdufan and Upper Blue Nile in 1979, the Unity oilfields in 1980 and Adar oilfields in 1981, and in Heglig in 1982. Access to the oil fields meant significant economic benefit to whoever controlled them.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalists in the north had been discontented with the Addis Ababa Agreement, which gave relative autonomy to the non-Islamic majority Southern Sudan Autonomous Region. The fundamentalists continued to grow in power, and in 1983 President Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state, terminating the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region.\\n\\nSection::::Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA).\\nThe Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) was founded in 1983 as a rebel group, to reestablish an autonomous Southern Sudan by fighting against the central government. While based in Southern Sudan, it identified itself as a movement for all oppressed Sudanese citizens, and was led by John Garang. Initially, the SPLA campaigned for a United Sudan, criticizing the central government for policies that were leading to national \"disintegration\".\\n\\nIn September 1985 announced the end of the state of emergency and dismantled the emergency courts but soon promulgated a new judiciary act, which continued many of the practices of the emergency courts. Despite Nimeiry\\'s public assurances that the rights of non-Muslims would be respected, southerners and other non-Muslims remained deeply suspicious.\\n\\nSection::::1985–1991.\\nOn 6 April 1985, senior military officers led by Gen. Abdul Rahman Suwar ad-Dahhab mounted a coup. Among the first acts of the new government was to suspend the 1983 constitution, rescind the decree declaring Sudan\\'s intent to become an Islamic state, and disband Nimeiry\\'s Sudan Socialist Union. However, the \"September laws\" instituting Islamic Sharia law were not suspended.\\n\\nA 15-member transitional military council was named, chaired by Gen. Suwar ad-Dahhab, in 1985. In consultation with an informal conference of political parties, unions, and professional organizations—known as the \"Gathering\"—the military council appointed an interim civilian cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Dr. Al-Jazuli Daf\\'allah. Elections were held in April 1986, and a transitional military council turned over power to a civilian government as promised. The government was headed by Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi of the Umma Party. It consisted of a coalition of the Umma Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (formerly the NUP-National Unionist Party), the National Islamic Front (NIF) of Hassan al-Turabi, and several southern region parties. This coalition dissolved and reformed several times over the next few years, with Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and his Umma Party always in a central role.\\n\\nSection::::Negotiation and escalation.\\nIn May 1986, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government coalition began peace negotiations with the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) led by Col. John Garang. In that year the SPLA and a number of Sudanese political parties met in Ethiopia and agreed to the \"Koka Dam\" declaration, which called for abolishing Islamic Sharia law and convening a constitutional conference. In 1988, the SPLA and the DUP agreed on a peace plan calling for the abolition of military pacts with Egypt and Libya, freezing of Sharia law, an end to the state of emergency, and a cease-fire. However, during this period the second civil war intensified in lethality, and the national economy continued to deteriorate. When prices of basic goods were increased in 1988, riots ensued, and the price increases were cancelled. When Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi refused to approve a peace plan reached by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) in November 1988, the DUP left the government. The new government consisted essentially of the Umma Party and the fundamentalist National Islamic Front (NIF).\\nIn February 1989, the army presented Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi with an ultimatum: he could move toward peace or be removed. He chose to form a new government with the DUP, and approved the SPLA/DUP peace plan. A constitutional conference was tentatively planned for September 1989.\\n\\nSection::::Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation.\\nOn 30 June 1989, however, military officers under then Col. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, with National Islamic Front (NIF) instigation and support, replaced the Sadiq al-Mahdi government with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (RCC), a military junta of 15 military officers (reduced to 12 in 1991) assisted by a civilian cabinet. As General al-Bashir he became: president; chief of state; prime minister; and chief of the armed forces.\\n\\nThe RCC al-Bashir military government banned trade unions, political parties, and other \"non-religious\" institutions. About 78,000 members of the army, police, and civil administration were purged in order to reshape the government.\\n\\nSection::::Criminal Act of 1991.\\nIn March 1991, a new penal code, the Criminal Act of 1991, instituted harsh punishments nationwide, including amputations and stoning. Although the southern states were officially exempt from these Islamic prohibitions and penalties, the 1991 act provided for a possible future application of Islamic Shari’a law in the south. In 1993, the government transferred most non-Muslim judges from the south to the north, replacing them with Muslim judges in the south. The introduction of Public Order Police to enforce Shari’a law resulted in the arrest, and treatment under Shari’a penalties, of southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north.\\n\\nSection::::Conduct of the war: 1991–2001.\\nThe Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) was in control of large areas of Equatoria, Bahr al Ghazal, and Upper Nile provinces and also operated in the southern portions of Darfur, Kordofan, and Blue Nile provinces. The government controlled a number of the major southern towns and cities, including Juba, Wau, and Malakal. An informal cease-fire in May broke down in October 1989.\\n\\nIn July 1992, a government offensive seized southern Sudan, and captured the SPLA headquarters in Torit.\\n\\nBoth the government regular armed forces and notorious militia (known as the People\\'s Defense Forces, PDF) were used to attack and raid villages in the South and the Nuba Mountains. Sudan’s national governments have a long history of using proxies in Southern Sudan, and the North–South border areas, to fight their wars and preserve their regular forces. These militias were recruited locally, and with covert ties to the national government. Many of the Khartoum-aligned groups were created and then armed by the NIF in a deliberate ‘divide and rule’ strategy.\\n\\nSection::::SPLA dissension.\\nIn August 1991, internal dissension among the rebels led opponents of Colonel Garang\\'s leadership of the SPLA to form the so-called Nasir faction of the SPLA rebel army. The attempt to overthrow Garang was led by Riek Machar and Lam Akol. In November 1991, SPLA-Nasir carried out the Bor massacre, killing an estimated 2000 civilians. In September 1992, William Nyuon Bany formed a second rebel faction, and in February 1993, Kerubino Kwanyin Bol formed a third rebel faction. On 5 April 1993, the three dissident rebel factions announced a coalition of their groups called SPLA United at a press conference in Nairobi, Kenya.\\n\\nSection::::Sudanese alignments.\\nIn 1990–91, the Sudanese government supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This changed American attitudes toward the country. Bill Clinton\\'s administration prohibited American investment in the country and supplied money to neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions. The US also began attempts to \"isolate\" Sudan and began referring to it as a rogue state.\\n\\nSince 1993, the leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya have pursued a peace initiative for Sudan under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), but results have been mixed. Despite that record, the IGAD initiative promulgated the 1994 Declaration of Principles (DOP) that aimed to identify the essential elements necessary to a just and comprehensive peace settlement; i.e., the relationship between religion and the state, power-sharing, wealth-sharing, and the right of self-determination for the south. The Sudanese Government did not sign the DOP until 1997 after major battlefield losses to the SPLA.\\n\\nSection::::SPLA alignments.\\nIn 1995, the opposition in the north united with parties from the south to create a coalition of opposition parties called the National Democratic Alliance. This development opened a northeastern front to the civil war, making it more than before a center-periphery rather than simply a north-south conflict. The SPLA, DUP, and Umma Parties were the key groups forming the NDA, along with several smaller parties and northern ethnic groups.\\n\\nIn 1995, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda stepped up their military assistance to the SPLA to the point of sending active troops into Sudan. Eritrean and Ethiopian military involvement weakened when the two countries entered a border conflict in 1998. Uganda\\'s support weakened when it shifted its attention to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nBy 1997, seven groups in the government camp, led by former Garang lieutenant Riek Machar, signed the Khartoum Peace Agreement with the NIF, thereby forming the largely symbolic South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) umbrella. Furthermore, the government signed the Nuba Mountains, and Fashoda agreements with rebel factions. These included the Khartoum agreements that ended military conflict between the government and significant rebel factions. Many of those leaders then moved to Khartoum where they assumed marginal roles in the central government, or collaborated with the government in military engagements against the SPLA. These three agreements paralleled the terms and conditions of the IGAD agreement, calling for a degree of autonomy for the south and the right of self-determination. Nevertheless, the SPLA made major advances in 1997 due to the success of Operation Thunderbolt, an offensive during which the South Sudanese separatists seized most of Central and Western Equatoria from the government.\\n\\nIn July 2000, the Libyan/Egyptian Joint Initiative on the Sudan was made moot, calling for the establishment of an interim government, power-sharing, constitutional reform, and new elections. Southern critics objected to the joint initiative because it neglected to address issues of the relationship between religion and the state and failed to mention the right of shelf-determination. It is unclear to what extent this initiative will have a significant impact on the search for peace, as some critics view it as more aimed at a resolution among northern political parties and protecting the perceived security interests of Egypt in favour of the unity of the Sudan.\\n\\nSection::::Peace agreement.\\nPeace talks between the southern rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004, although skirmishes in parts of the south continued. A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed on 9 January 2005 in Nairobi.\\n\\n\\nThe status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations.\\n\\nSection::::Foreign interventions.\\nIn 1999, Egypt and Libya initiated the Egypt-Libya Initiative (ELI). By this time the peace process of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) had reached a stalemate. ELI\\'s main purpose had been to bring members of the non-Southern opposition (especially opposition in the north) aboard the talks. However, as ELI avoided contentious issues, such as secession, it lacked support from the SPLA, but the NDA leadership accepted it. By 2001, ELI had been unable to bring about any agreement between the parties.\\n\\nIn September 2001, former U.S. Senator John Danforth was designated Presidential Envoy for Peace in the Sudan. His role was to explore the prospects that the US could play a useful catalytic role in the search for a just end to the civil war, and enhance humanitarian services delivery that can help reduce the suffering of the Sudanese people stemming from war related effects.\\n\\nFollowing an internal outcry, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government in March 1989 agreed with the United Nations and donor nations (including the US) on a plan called Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), under which some 100,000 tons of food was moved into both government and SPLA-held areas of the Sudan, and widespread starvation was averted. Phase II of OLS to cover 1990 was approved by both the government and the SPLA Sudan faced a 2-year drought and food shortage across the entire country. The US, UN, and other donors attempted to mount a coordinated international relief effort in both north and south Sudan to prevent a catastrophe. However, due to Sudan\\'s human rights abuses and its pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf War, many donors cut much of their aid to the Sudan. In a similar drought in 2000–01, the international community again responded to avert mass starvation in the Sudan. International donors continue to provide large amounts of humanitarian aid to all parts of the Sudan.\\n\\nThe US government\\'s Sudan Peace Act of 21 October 2002 accused Sudan of genocide for killing more than 2 million civilians in the south during the civil war since 1983.\\n\\nSection::::Arms suppliers.\\nSudan relied on a variety of countries for its arms supplies. Following independence, the army was trained and supplied by the British. However, after the 1967 Six-Day War, relations were cut off, as were relations with the United States and West Germany.\\n\\nFrom 1968 to 1972, the Soviet Union and COMECON nations sold large numbers of weapons and provided technical assistance and training to Sudan. At this time the army grew from a strength of 18,000 to roughly 50,000 men. Large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery were acquired, and they dominated the army until the late 1980s.\\n\\nRelations cooled between the two sides after the coup in 1972, and the Khartoum government sought to diversify its suppliers. The Soviet Union continued to supply weapons until 1977, when their support of Marxist elements in Ethiopia angered the Sudanese sufficiently to cancel their deals. The People\\'s Republic of China was the main supplier in the late 1970s.\\n\\nEgypt was the most important military partner in the 1970s, providing missiles, personnel carriers, and other military hardware. At the same time military cooperation between the two countries was important.\\n\\nU.S.-aligned countries resumed supplying Sudan in the mid-1970s. The United States began selling Sudan a great deal of equipment around 1976, hoping to counteract Soviet support of Marxist Ethiopians and Libyans. Military sales peaked in 1982 at US$101 million. West Germany established an ammunitions factory in Khartoum and introduced vast quantities of automatic small arms to Sudan. After the start of the second civil war, American assistance dropped, and was eventually cancelled in 1987.\\n\\nIn November 1993, Iran was reported to have financed Sudan´s purchase of some 20 Chinese ground-attack aircraft. Iran pledged $17 million in financial aid to the Sudanese government, and arranged for $300 million in Chinese arms to be delivered to the Sudanese army.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the rebel SPLA was supplied weapons through or by Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The Israeli embassy in Kenya also supplied anti-tank missiles to the rebels.\\n\\nSection::::Child soldiers.\\nArmies from all sides enlisted children in their ranks. The 2005 agreement required that child soldiers be demobilized and sent home. The SPLA claimed to have let go 16,000 of its child soldiers between 2001 and 2004. However, international observers (UN and Global Report 2004) have found demobilized children have often been re-recruited by the SPLA. As of 2004, there were between 2,500 and 5,000 children serving in the SPLA. Rebels have promised to demobilize all children by the end of 2010. The goal was met.\\n\\nThe Nuer White Army, a minor participant in the war in the Greater Upper Nile region, consisted largely of armed Nuer youths, but it was principally self-organised and often operated autonomously of both elders\\' authority and the dictates of the major factions.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Second Sudanese Civil War', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1131537'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '4RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11315605', 'text': 'I.Ae. 24 Calquin\\n\\nThe I.Ae.24 Calquin (a Mapudungun word which means \"Royal Eagle\") was a tactical bomber designed and built by the \"Instituto Aerotécnico\" (Córdoba) in Argentina in the immediate post-World War II era. Although superficially a \"look-alike\" for the de Havilland Mosquito, the I.Ae.24 was powered by twin Pratt & Whitney R-1830-G “Twin Wasp” radials giving it a distinct appearance. After an operational career spanning two decades, the Calquin was retired.\\nSection::::Design and development.\\nPatterned after the successful de Havilland Mosquito, the Calquín had a wooden structure similar to the FMA AeMB.2, and was the first twin-engined aircraft designed and built in Argentina. The I.Ae.24 design was based on a cantilever mid-mounted wooden (indigenous woods were used throughout) wings with fabric-covered flying surfaces. The conventional main twin-oleo undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles while the tailwheel retracted into the aft fuselage. The two-man crew were seated side-by-side under a large transparency constructed partly of acrylic glass with glass panels. The armament consisted of four 12.7\\xa0mm machine guns grouped in the nose. Some examples later had four 20\\xa0mm cannons and an internal bombload of 1,764\\xa0lb (800\\xa0kg) kg along with 12 rockets (75\\xa0mm) mounted under the wings.\\n\\nOriginally the I.Ae. 24 was also intended to be equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlins but an adequate supply of the powerplants was not possible, consequently Pratt & Whitney R-1830-G “Twin Wasp” radials of 1,050\\xa0hp (782.5\\xa0kW) were substituted. Performance estimates of a Merlin-powered variant would have made it comparable to the Mosquito but the R-1830-powered prototype was able to achieve only 273\\xa0mph (440\\xa0km/h), making the aircraft unstable and prone to stalling. A later prototype, the I.Ae.28 was equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlins but the project was superseded by the more capable I.Ae. 30 \"Ñancú\".\\n\\nSection::::Operational history.\\nDespite the lower performance obtained in testing, the I.Ae.24 Calquin was able to undertake an attack and light bombing role, replacing the Northrop A-17 in the Argentine Air Force inventory. A total of 100 aircraft were ordered, with the first production example flying on 4 July 1946. Fifty pilots and crew members were killed in accidents related to Calquín operational service and trials. Test pilots considered the aircraft unstable \"on all three axes\" and required careful handling. Series production was completed by 1950, with operational service continuing until 1957 although a small number of aircraft were still in squadron use until 1960.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'I.Ae. 24 Calquin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11315605'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '4hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1131669', 'text': 'Syria national football team\\n\\nThe Syria national football team (, ) represents Syria in association football and is controlled by the Syrian Arab Federation for Football, the governing body for football in Syria.

Verfaillie (; born 1957) is a Belgian molecular biologist and professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). Her work on the ability of adult stem cells to differentiate to different cell types has garnered controversy due to accusations of poor laboratory practices and fabrication of data by members of her laboratory.\\n\\nSection::::Education and career.\\nBorn in Ypres, she obtained an M.D. from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 1982, after which she specialized in internal medicine. In 1987 she departed for the United States as a research fellow at the University of Minnesota. She worked in the lab of Phillip McGlave in hematopoiesis and stromal control of hematopoietic stem cells, in 1991 becoming a professor in the Department of Medicine, becoming a full professor in 1997.\\n\\nVerfaillie was Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University of Minnesota (U.S.) from 1998 until 2006. In a widely noted paper in 2002, she claimed a specific type of adult-derived stem cells (termed multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC)).\\n\\nShe is a Professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation of the University of Minnesota\\'s Medical School. She holds the Anderson Chair in Stem Cell Biology and the McKnight\\'s Presidential Chair in Stem Cell Biology. She now leads the \"Stamcel Instituut te Leuven\" (SCIL, Stem Cell Institute Leuven) at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Leuven, Belgium. She is a member of the Advisory Board of the Itinera Institute think-tank. \\n\\nSection::::Controversy and aftermath over stem cell falsification.\\nThe report was immediately sensational in scientific circles given that it was the first report of adult-derived stem cells to have properties previously ascribed to embryonic stem cell only. The report was immediately also heralded by conservative lawmakers opposed to embryonic stem cell research as proof that such research is not needed. Skepticism surrounded the announcement from the beginning: Stuart Orkin from the Harvard Medical School noted, \"\"If the cells are what she says -- and I have no reason to dispute that but no one has demonstrated it yet -- it\\'s pretty remarkable. For people interested in tissue regeneration, this would be the cell to work with.\"\"\\n\\nVerfaillie was noted to immediately benefit from the interest in adult stem cells with her lab size and funding immediately doubling.\\nThe discovery was considered so ground-breaking that she received several accolades in the first few years after the initial report. The British biomedical publication \"New Scientist\" declared it as the \"ultimate stem cell discovery\". Problems with working with MAPCs proved difficult to several laboratories who were keen to co-operate in expanding the use of MAPCs. In a report in \"Nature\", Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch at MIT was quoted by \"Nature\" stating that \"I have not seen any convincing data showing that anyone has repeated the chimaera experiment, so I don\\'t think this part of it is true\", referring to the claim by Verfaillie that MAPCs when injected into mouse embryos contribute to all tissues.\\n\\nThe same article also quoted Orkin as saying that the material transfer agreement (MTA) for procuring these cells were so restrictive that his group refused to work with them.\\nFirst reports on potential problems with Verfaillie\\'s group\\'s work came in early 2007 when \"New Scientist\" reported that the 2002 Nature paper had some of the images appear in a second paper published at about the same time. The article also revealed duplication of images in a 2001 paper on blood, authored by Verfaillie\\'s trainee, Morayma Reyes, and that a patent application for the MAPCs was licensed to a company called Athersys, based in Cleveland, Ohio. A series of investigations into at least three instances of data duplication/ fabrication by the University of Minnesota followed, which eventually concluded in October 2008 that Morayma Reyes had fabricated data in the 2001 paper. \\n\\nThe panel criticized Verfaillie\\'s laboratory for “poor scientific method and inadequate training and oversight for this research”. It contacted Blood and asked the journal to retract the paper. The investigators also found discrepancies with images in a second paper from Verfaillie\\'s laboratory, published in the \"Journal of Clinical Investigation\" in 2002. Those problems did not rise to the level of academic misconduct, the university said. It did not find fault directly with Verfaillie, but Tim Mulcahy concluded that the “message here is that everyone needs to fulfill their responsibility to the public and to science”.\\n\\nIn response to the investigation at the University of Minnesota, \"Nature\" instituted their own investigation to the 2002 controversial paper and Verfaillie was allowed to make a Corrigendum to the original paper, which did not acknowledge fabrication of data, and claimed that the original observation still held. The issue raised by Rudolf Jaenisch and others regarding the non-reproducibility of the blastocyst injection data was not addressed by the reviewers of Verfaillie. In early 2010, a third paper by the group in the \"American Journal of Cell Physiology\" was withdrawn due to \"data presented have now been shown to be unreliable. This was again prompted by an investigation by \\'New Scientist\".\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath of scandal and move back to Belgium.\\nVerfaillie moved to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven at the height of the controversy in 2006 but retained her position at the University of Minnesota. She has continued to defend her work and gave a list of publications that have proven the utility of MAPCs, albeit without addressing the criticisms of how the key parts of her work could not be reproduced by other labs. In 2007, she collaborated with Irving Weissman at Stanford University to demonstrate that MAPCs could produce blood cells although she did not address the key claims of her original 2002 paper.\\n\\nVerfaillie is on the editorial board of journals such as \"Experimental Hematology\" and PLOS one.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Catherine Verfaillie', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11318854'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5BhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1131913', 'text': 'Alasdair Alpin MacGregor\\n\\nAlasdair Alpin MacGregor (March 20, 1899 – 1970) was a Scottish writer and photographer, known for a large number of travel books. He wrote also on Scottish folklore, and was a published poet.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nHe was born at Applecross, Ross and Cromarty, on 20 March 1899, the son of Colonel John MacGregor M.D. of the Indian Medical Service. He was educated at Tain Academy.\\n\\nMacGregor was brought up in Tain and Inverness, and educated there and in Edinburgh. His books were mainly about Scotland, and his romanticising style incurred the displeasure of Compton Mackenzie, who caricatured him in some of his novels (perhaps unjustly so as MacGregor was forced to be critically realistic about certain aspects of life on the west coast, in his book \"The Western Isles\"). Judging by the title of the 1931 book \"A Last Voyage to St. Kilda. Being the Observations and Adventures of an Egotistic Private Secretary who was alleged to have been \\'warned off\\' That Island by Admiralty Officials when attempting to emulate Robinson Crusoe at the Time of Its Evacuation\" there might have been something to caricature. In partial explanation, St Kilda was evacuated in 1930; at the time he was Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The same book was the subject of a legal case when MacGregor brought an injunction to prevent the distribution of \"The Edge of the World\", a film by Michael Powell that he claimed was based on it. MacGregor lost the case.\\n\\nHe lived in London for most of his adult life in Swan Court and Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea. Along with T. Ratcliffe Barnett, an Edinburgh minister and author, MacGregor reflects a transitional period during the first half of the 20th century when the north of Scotland was still rural and mostly unaffected by modern society.\\n\\nMacGregor was also a campaigner against cruelty to animals, including vivisection and hunting for sport. In the years before his death in 1970, he visited the United States often and was a mentor to a young Marion Barry, who later became mayor of Washington, D.C.\\n\\nHis book about his childhood, \"The Goat Wife\", tells the evocative story of his hard working and resourceful Aunt Dorothy, who left a comfortable existence in Edinburgh\\'s Ann Street - reputed to be the most haunted street in Edinburgh - to begin life as a solo crofter in the Easter Ross village of Ardgay (then known locally as \"High Wind\"). Spanning the period before the First World War until the end of the Second, it captures the last remnants of the simplicity, privations and charm of Scottish rural community life.

Orthologs are found in mammals and birds. It is a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family and detects single stranded RNA.\\n\\nSection::::Function.\\nThe TLR family plays an important role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is predominantly expressed in lung, placenta, and spleen, and lies in close proximity to another family member, TLR8, on the human X chromosome.\\n\\nTLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA in endosomes, which is a common feature of viral genomes which are internalised by macrophages and dendritic cells. TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA of viruses such as HIV and HCV. TLR7 can recognize GU-rich single-stranded RNA. However, the presence of GU-rich sequences in the single-stranded RNA is not sufficient to stimulate TLR7.\\n\\nSection::::Clinical significance.\\nImiquimod acts upon TLR7.\\n\\nTLR7 has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) as well as in the regulation of antiviral immunity. Although not yet fully elucidated, using an unbiased genome-scale screen with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), it has been demonstrated that the receptor TREML4 acts as an essential positive regulator of TLR7 signalling. In TREML4 -/- mice macrophages that are hyporesponsive to TLR7 agonists, macrophages fail to produce type I interferons due to impaired phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and decreased recruitment of the adaptor MyD88 to TLR7. TREML4 deficiency reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies in MRL/lpr mice, suggesting that TRL7 is a vital component of antiviral immunity and a predecessor factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases such as SLE. A TLR7 agonist, Aldara, an imidazoquinoline, has been approved for topical use in treating warts caused by papillomavirus and for actinic keratoses. \\n\\nDue to their ability to induce robust production of anti-cancer cytokines such as interleukin-12, TLR7 agonists have been investigated for cancer immunotherapy. Recent examples include TMX-202 delivery via liposomal formulation, as well as the delivery of resiquimod via nanoparticles formed from beta-cyclodextrin. \\n', 'title': 'TLR7', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11329477'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '6hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1133351', 'text': 'VSS Enterprise\\n\\nVSS \"Enterprise\" (tail number: N339SS) was the first SpaceShipTwo (SS2) spaceplane, built by Scaled Composites for Virgin Galactic.

This was the first spacecraft-related accident in which part, but not all, of the crew survived. An investigation revealed the accident was caused by premature deployment of the \"feathering\" system, the ship\\'s descent device; the NTSB also faulted the spacecraft\\'s design for lacking fail-safe mechanisms that could have deterred or prevented early deployment.\\n\\nSection::::Flight test program.\\nInitial projections by Virgin Galactic in 2008 called for test flights to begin in late 2009 and commercial service to start in 2011. This schedule was not achieved, with captive carry and glide flight tests beginning in 2010, and the first test flight under rocket power in 2013.\\n\\nIn October 2009, Virgin Galactic CEO Will Whitehorn outlined the flight test program for SpaceShipTwo. The test program includes seven phases:\\n\\nOn 22 March 2010, the SpaceShipTwo vehicle VSS \"Enterprise\" underwent a captive carry test flight, with the parent White Knight Two aircraft, VMS \"Eve\", performing a short flight while carrying the \"Enterprise\".\\nA second test flight was made on 16 May 2010, reaching SS2\\'s launch altitude (51,000 feet) and lasting nearly five hours, in order to facilitate \"cold soak\" testing of SS2\\'s avionics and pressurization system. Thereafter, \"a simulated spaceship descent/glide mission was made from [launch] altitude.\"\\nBetween these two flights, the SpaceShipTwo airframe was modified by the addition of two interior fins, with one fin being added to the inside (rocket-side) of each of the craft\\'s twin vertical stabilizers.\\n\\nOn 15 July 2010, VSS \"Enterprise\" made its first crewed flight. The craft remained attached to VMS \"Eve\" as planned, and underwent a series of combined vehicle systems tests. The flight lasted a total of 6 hours and 21 minutes. A second, similar crewed flight of VSS \"Enterprise\" and VMS \"Eve\" was carried out on 30 September 2010, lasting approximately 5 hours. Among the objectives of these flights was the improvement of pilot proficiency, and the results of the flights were deemed to show that the systems were capable of supporting future glide missions.\\n\\nOn 10 October 2010, VSS \"Enterprise\" made its first manned gliding test flight. It was released from VMS \"Eve\" at 13700 m feet and glided to a safe landing at the Mojave Air and Spaceport. A second gliding test flight took place on 28 October 2010 and a third on 17 November 2010. , Scaled reported that the flight test program was exceeding expectations. The fourth test flight took place on 13 January 2011, while the fifth and sixth glide flights occurred on 22 and 27 April 2011, respectively. Following this, the feathered reentry configuration was tested in flight on 4 May 2011, with weekly test flights continuing through the end of May.\\nOn 9 June 2011, SS2 failed to separate from White Knight Two during its 11th planned glide flight due to a technical problem. Testing resumed with five successful glide flights in June 2011.\\n\\nIn July 2011, after 15 successful glide flights, flight testing of SS2 was halted for two months while planned revisions to the spaceplane were made. Flight tests resumed in late September 2011, although the 16th glide flight\\xa0– on 29 September\\xa0– was marred by a brief loss of control aboard SS2, forcing the crew to utilise the feathered wing configuration to land safely. This test was followed by another hiatus, during which some of the spacecraft\\'s engine components were installed. In June 2012, Scaled Composites received an FAA permit to conduct rocket-powered supersonic test flights. SpaceShipTwo flight tests resumed in June 2012.\\n\\nIn September 2012, Virgin Galactic announced that the unpowered subsonic glide flight test program was essentially complete. The company thereafter stated its intention to fit the hybrid rocket motor and control system to the vehicle, before resuming the glide flight test program with the rocket motor installed, in order to recharacterize the spacecraft\\'s glide performance with slightly different weight distribution and aerodynamics. In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket motor, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.\\n\\nThe spacecraft\\'s first powered test flight took place on 29 April 2013, briefly driving SpaceShipTwo to a supersonic velocity. Richard Branson said it \"couldn\\'t have gone more smoothly\".\\n\\nOn 5 September 2013, the second powered flight was made by the SpaceShipTwo. It broke the sound barrier achieving a speed of mach 1.43, and climbed to 69.000 feet (21\\xa0km) over the Mojave Desert under rocket power and descended using its tilt-wing \"feathering\" maneuver. Space journalist Doug Messier reported that \"the engine plume featured white smoke, not the black smoke seen on the April flight.\"\\n\\nOn 10 January 2014, the third powered flight climbed higher than the previous flights, testing a new coating on the tail boom and other systems.\\n\\nSection::::List of test flights.\\n\"Sources:\" \\n\\nLegend\\n\\nSection::::Crash.\\nOn 31 October 2014, \"Enterprise\" broke apart in flight during a powered test flight over California\\'s Mojave Desert. \\nThe flight began smoothly, with \"Enterprise\" being dropped from its WhiteKnightTwo carrier and igniting its engine at an altitude of . About 60 to 90 seconds into the flight, an \"anomaly\" was reported which resulted in destruction of the ship. The pilot in command, Peter Siebold, escaped from the craft and parachuted to safety; the copilot, Michael Alsbury, was killed in the crash.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board conducted an independent investigation into the accident. In July 2015, the NTSB released a report which cited inadequate design safeguards, poor pilot training, lack of rigorous federal oversight and a potentially anxious co-pilot without recent flight experience as important factors in the crash. The NTSB determined that the crash resulted from the pilot\\'s premature deployment of the feathering mechanism, which is normally used to aid a safe descent. The NTSB also faulted the ship\\'s designers for failing to protect against human error, noting that the spacecraft lacked fail-safe systems that would have prevented or deterred a premature deployment of the feathering mechanism. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish human factors guidance specific to commercial spaceflight operators and create a more rigorous application process for experimental spaceflight permits.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'VSS Enterprise', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1133351'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '6xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11334051', 'text': 'Eusebio Oehl\\n\\nEusebio Oehl (December 5, 1827 – April 10, 1903) was an Italian histologist and physiologist who was a native of Lodi. \\n\\nHe studied medicine at the University of Pavia, and following graduation (1850), he continued his education in Vienna under Joseph Hyrtl (1810-1894) and Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819-1892).

The episode was originally scheduled to be the series finale before Fox decided to renew the series.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nWith Lucky and Luanne engaged, the couple have begun planning their wedding. Luanne believes that Lucky\\'s lawsuit winnings mean that they can have a lavish wedding, despite Lucky telling her that he doesn\\'t have much of his settlement money left. Willing to do what it takes to make Luanne\\'s wedding dreams come true, Lucky seeks advice from Hank. Hank, despite objecting to Luanne\\'s extravagant desires, refers Lucky to Dale, who with a citywide bedbug epidemic on his hands has more pest control calls than he alone can handle. When Dale gives Lucky a gas mask and goggles for his new job, he says that the equipment makes him look like a bug, and the two have a mock-swordfight with spray wands. However, Lucky sustains a fall as they do so and suffers a back injury, regretfully deciding that he\\'ll have to sue Dale\\'s Dead-Bug in order to afford Luanne\\'s dream wedding. After Lucky\\'s tort lawyer Edward Johnson determines that there\\'s no money to be made in suing Dale, he convinces Lucky to instead sue Strickland Propane after using convoluted jargon to pin blame on Hank, as a Strickland employee, for having referred Lucky to Dale in the first place.\\n\\nLuanne remains indifferent to Hank\\'s disgust at the frivolous lawsuit; however, Lucky continues to regret the situation. After discussing things with Hank, Lucky goes back to Johnson and asks to drop the lawsuit, but Johnson guilts him out of dropping by saying that it would be malpractice to do so. Dismayed, Lucky relays Johnson\\'s refusal to the guys, and Dale comes up with a plan: have Lucky fake not being injured so that there will appear to be no grounds to sue. Hank, Dale, and Lucky film a video of Lucky teeing off at the golf course (with Lucky barely suppressing his pain long enough to make it look convincing) and bring it to Johnson, who agrees that the footage is enough to destroy the case. However, Lucky drops a tire pressure gauge on the floor of the law office, and Johnson waits with a smirk for the \\'man with the perfectly healthy back\\' to pick it up, watching as Lucky struggles to reach it. Thinking quickly, Lucky tells Dale that he looks like a bug, and Dale catches on, grabs a nearby umbrella, and knocks Lucky down. With Lucky in pain on the floor of the office, Hank tells Johnson that they could now sue \"him\" using the same jargon with which he had intended to sue Strickland Propane, since they have the video footage of Lucky appearing healthy prior to coming to his office. Defeated and Furious, Johnson cuts Lucky a check for $53,000 on the spot.\\n\\nLuanne\\'s delight with the new settlement money quickly changes to indignance when Lucky proposes to instead use the money to buy a house and have a simpler, less expensive wedding. Her mind decidedly changes, however, when Lucky also shows her that they will have enough left over to buy baby clothes as well. On the day of the wedding, which is being held in the Hills\\' backyard, Hank goes to Luanne who seems a bit depressed over how basic the wedding is and apologizes for the simplicity of the ceremony, and she forgives him when he presents her with a wedding gift of two airline tickets and hotel fare to anywhere in the continental United States. Reverend Stroup arrives, and Luanne and Lucky are happily married before a large audience of friends and family. Afterward, as Lucky\\'s truck pulls into the driveway of the newlyweds\\' new home across the street, Hank and his friends contentedly sip beer in the alley.\\n\\nSection::::Production notes.\\nAs the episode was originally intended as the series finale, it includes references to earlier episodes. For example, in the ending wedding scene, a montage of many \\'one-time\\' and other minor characters from previous episodes at the wedding, including the social worker from the first episode and \"Junkie Business\", Monsignor Martinez, Luanne\\'s beauty-school teacher Ms. Kremzer, Sharona Johnson, \"Hottyyz\" Owner Collete Davis, \"Arlen Bystander\" Columnist Bob Jenkins, Lucky\\'s friends Elvin and Mud Dobber, Ted, Cindy, and Chane Wassanasong, Hank\\'s half-brother Junichiro, Patch Boomhauer and his Grandmother, Tammy Duvall, Mack Walker, Hank\\'s Mother Tillie and her husband Gary Kasner, Ms. Wakefield, Ernst, Peggy\\'s mother (\"A Rover Runs Through It\" version) and Dale\\'s father Bug Gribble are seen. Also, Cotton Hill tells Kahn that he\\'ll have a mai tai at the wedding much like he did in his first appearance in the episode \"Shins of the Father\". Chuck Mangione appears at the end of the wedding scene. Once an often recurring character in early seasons, he has rarely appeared in more recent episodes.

Where a player decides not to answer their question, the team captain will normally decide which other member of the team is to answer. The opposition will also decide who is to answer the question in the event of it being passed over. After 4 rounds, the order of answering changes so the team who began round 1 going first begin round 5 going second. This is done by switching each team\\'s questions from A to B or from B to A depending on which questions they started with.\\n\\nIn league competitions, a win scores four points, a draw scores two points and a close defeat (losing by three points or fewer) scores one point. In addition, if all four members of a team get all of their own questions correct in any given round (a \"full house\"), an additional bonus point is scored.\\n\\nIn knockout competitions where a draw is not permitted, an additional ninth round of questions is played. If the scores are still tied at the end of the ninth round, a tie-breaker is played.\\n\\nSection::::Individual format.\\nMany quiz leagues run individual competitions. QLL\\'s uses the MIMIR quiz format (named after Mímir, a god of Norse mythology who was renowned for his knowledge and wisdom). Matches are played in groups of four with positions drawn at random and each person has 3 questions addressed to them, in each of 5 rounds.\\n\\nTime to answer is at the discretion of the question master but a wrong answer or a pass gives any of the other three an opportunity to score a bonus point. The decision as to who gets the first chance to answer for a bonus is determined by offering the question to whoever, at that stage, has made fewest attempts to gain bonus points or, if there is more than one player who has made the fewest bonus attempts, the next player in line (e.g. if this happened on the first question, P2 would have the first option on a bonus attempt). As well as a scorekeeper, a bonus counter is needed to track each player\\'s bonus attempts.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'The Quiz League of London', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11342728'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11343294', 'text': 'Tuto\\n\\nLivonir Ruschel (born 2 July 1979 in Dionísio Cerqueira) is a Brazilian professional football player.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Tuto', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11343294'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11344265', 'text': 'Caumasee\\n\\nCaumasee (Romansh: \"Lag la Cauma\" or \"Lai da Cauma\") is a lake near Flims, in the Grisons, Switzerland. It is one of the lakes on the Flims Rockslide deposits. The lake is fed from underground sources. Its surface area is 10.3194\\xa0ha.\\n\\nThe level of the lake varies by approximately 4 to 5 meters along with the varying underground water flow during the year, hence reaches its minimum by the end of April when snow melting in the mountains increases. A maximum level is reached by mid July but may be topped in August even after previous falling due to summer rain. The very western bay never freezes in winter, probably showing a maximum water flow in this area.\\n\\nWhen the lake is at a low level, with a small volume of water, it warms up sooner than most lakes in the region, so people can be seen starting to swim the lake in April while bigger lakes even in lower areas of Switzerland remain rather cool. Water temperature in summer is at an average 21 Celsius, with a maximum around 24 Celsius.\\n\\nThe lake is in a huge forest that was allowed to remain on the agriculturally useless debris area of the biggest prehistoric rockslide in the Alps and can only be reached by a footpath (wheelchair accessible), possibly using a funicular built in 1939, refurbished in 1988 on its original tracks (running May to October only). The walk from the edge of town to the funicular takes about 10 minutes.\\n\\nSection::::Flow system.\\nAs close as 500 yards to the Caumasee is another dell and altering lake, called Lag Tuleritg, which is just about level to the Caumasee; it is just 18 meters higher. This lake dries out completely in autumn and remains empty until being filled by a small river of just about 800m in length, covering some 100 meters difference in altitude. That river will start flowing around May, depending on temperatures and snow melt rate in the mountains. Its origin is another lake, Lag Prau Pulté, which is fed by underground water only in spring, disappearing in autumn and staying dry all winter. During a cold period in spring, water that entered the basin of this lake may disappear again as snow melt decreases and all water remains in the underground flow. Due to its origin, the water of both lakes is grey all summer until the level starts to go down in autumn. In Lag Prau Pulte one can see another special effect caused by air being forced out of the underground; this is causing the lake not only to remain grey but to frequently produce bubbles and therefore different colours can be seen on the surface.\\n\\nThe flow system has been severely attacked by building the Flims Bypass Tunnel when engineers decided to divert some 800 Litres per minute of underground water flow out of the tunnel instead of sealing it into the rock. Further changes occurred when the basin that fills with water every year, was slightly altered. Since 2011 additional water is being fed near the tunnel into the river running from Lag Prau Pulte to Lag Tuleritg to compensate the water loss in the underground system.\\n\\nA fourth lake, Crestasee, is also fed by underground water but retains a constant level all year.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Caumasee', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11344265'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1134489', 'text': \"List of airports in Indonesia\\n\\nThis is a list of airports in Indonesia, sorted by location.\\n\\nThe Republic of Indonesia comprises 13,466 islands in Southeast Asia and Oceania.

Judah Löb\".\\n\\nAt the age of twenty he went to Berlin, where he received instruction from Isaac Satanow, who was a follower of Moses Mendelssohn. In Berlin Löwe met Mendelssohn, his acquaintance with whom soon ripened into friendship. Mendelssohn\\'s influence was doubtless instrumental in securing for Löwe the position of tutor in the house of the influential David Friedländer. Löwe became a most intimate friend of another prominent Mendelssohnian, Isaac Abraham Euchel, whose first work, a Hebrew biography of Mendelssohn, contains a dedicatory letter addressed to Löwe.

Glossop is near Derbyshire\\'s county borders with Cheshire, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. It is between above mean sea level, and lies just outside the Peak District National Park.\\n\\nHistorically, the name Glossop refers to the small hamlet that gave its name to an ancient parish recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and then the manor given by William I of England to William Peverel. A municipal borough was created in 1866, and the unparished urban area within two local government wards. The area now known as Glossop approximates to the villages that used to be called Glossopdale, on the lands of the Duke of Norfolk. Originally a centre of wool processing, Glossop rapidly expanded in the late 18th century when it specialised in the production and printing of calico, a coarse cotton, and became a mill town with many chapels and churches, its fortunes tied to the cotton industry.\\n\\nArchitecturally, the area is dominated by buildings constructed of the local sandstone. There remain two significant former cotton mills and the Dinting railway viaduct. Glossop has transport links to Manchester, making the area popular for commuters.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Toponymy and definition.\\nThe name Glossop is thought to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, named during the Angles\\' settlement in the 7th century, and derived from \"Glott\\'s Hop\" – where \"hop\" could mean a valley, a small valley in a larger valley system, or a piece of land enclosed by marshes and \"Glott\" was probably a chieftain\\'s name. Because of its size and location, Glossop had many definitions. The village of Glossop is now called Old Glossop. Howard Town and Milltown gained importance. They were named New Town and then Glossop. Local government reorganisations had caused the Glossopdale villages to be promoted to a municipal borough and then have that status removed. Land has been added to Glossop and other lands removed. From a small settlement it became an ancient parish, a manor, a borough, and a township. Currently, two county divisions in High Peak Borough, Derbyshire, have Glossop as part of their names.\\n\\nSection::::Roman.\\nThere is evidence of a Bronze Age burial site on Shire Hill (near Old Glossop) and other possibly prehistoric remains at Torside (on the slopes of Bleaklow). The Romans arrived in 78 AD. At that time, the area was within the territory of the Brigantes tribe, whose main base was in Yorkshire. In the late 1st century the Romans built a fort, Ardotalia, on high ground above the river in present-day Gamesley. The site of this fort was rediscovered in 1771 by an amateur historian, John Watson. It subsequently acquired the name Melandra Castle. The extensive site has been excavated, revealing fort walls, a shrine and the fort headquarters. The area has been landscaped to provide parking and picnic areas.\\n\\nSection::::Medieval.\\nKing William I awarded the manor of Glossop to William Peveril, who began construction of Glossop Castle, but the entire estate was later confiscated. In 1157 King Henry II gave the manor of Glossop to Basingwerk Abbey. They gained a market charter for Glossop in 1290, and one for Charlesworth in 1328.\\nIn 1433, the monks leased all of Glossopdale to the Talbot family, later Earls of Shrewsbury. In 1494, an illegitimate son of the family, Dr John Talbot, was appointed vicar of Glossop. He founded a school, and paved the packhorse route over the moors; this is known as Doctor\\'s Gate.\\n\\nAt the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 the manor of Glossop was given to the Talbot family. In 1606 it came into the ownership of the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk, who held it for the next 300 years. Glossop was usually given to the second son of the family.\\nThe land was too wet and cold to be used for wheat but was ideal for the hardy Pennine sheep, so agriculture was predominantly pastoral. Most of the land was owned by the Howards and was leasehold and it was only in Whitfield that there was any freehold land. The few houses were solid, built of the local stone, and allowed for the development of home industries such as wool spinning and weaving.\\n\\nSection::::Industrial and civic history.\\nThe medieval economy was based on sheep pasture and the production of wool by farmers who were tenants of the Abbot of Basingwerk and later the Talbot family. During the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century Glossop became a centre for cotton spinning. A good transport network between Liverpool and Glossop brought in imported cotton which was spun by a labour force with wool spinning skills. The climate of Glossopdale provided abundant soft water that was used to power mills and finish the cloth, and also gave the humidity necessary to spin cotton under tension. Initial investment was provided by the Dukes of Norfolk. By 1740, cotton in an unspun form had been introduced to make fustians and lighter cloths.\\n\\nSection::::Mills.\\nThe first mills in Glossop were woollen mills. In 1774, Richard Arkwright opened a mill at Cromford. He developed the factory system and patented machines for spinning cotton and carding. In 1785, his patents expired and many people copied Arkwright\\'s system and his patents, exemplified by the Derwent Valley Mills. By 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright-type mills in Britain. At the same time there were 17 cotton mills in Derbyshire, principally in Glossop. By 1831 there were at least 30 mills in Glossopdale, none of which had more than 1,000 spindles. The mill owners were local men: the Wagstaffs and Hadfields were freeholders from Whitfield; the Shepleys, Shaws, Lees, Garlicks and Platts had farmed the dale. The Sidebottoms were from Hadfield, the Thornleys were carpenters and John Bennet and John Robinson were clothiers.\\n\\nJohn Wood of Marsden came from Manchester in 1819 and bought existing woollen mills which he expanded. These were the Howard Town mills. Francis Sumner was a Catholic whose family had connections with Matthew Ellison, Howard\\'s agent. He built Wren Nest Mill. The Sidebottoms built the Waterside Mill at Hadfield. In 1825, John Wood installed the first steam engine and power looms. Sumner and Sidebottom followed suit and the three mills, Wren Nest, Howardtown and Waterside, became very large vertical combines (a vertical combine was a mill that both spun the yarn and then used it to weave cloth). With the other major families, the Shepleys, Rhodes and Platts, they dominated the dale. In 1884, the six had 82% of the spinning capacity with 892,000 spindles and 13,571 looms. Glossop was a town of very large calico mills. The calico printing factory of Edmund Potter (located in Dinting Vale) in the 1850s printed 2,500,000 pieces of printed calico, of which 80% was for export. The paper industry was created by Edward Partington who, as Olive and Partington, bought the Turn Lee Mill in 1874 to produce high-quality paper from wood pulp by the sulphite method. He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow-in-Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1917. He died in 1925; his factories in Charlestown created nearly 1,000 jobs.\\n\\nSection::::Religion and benevolence.\\nLord Bernard Edward Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk rebuilt the old parish church in 1831, built All Saints Roman Catholic chapel in 1836, improved the Hurst Reservoir in 1837, and built the town hall, whose foundation stone was laid on Coronation Day 1838.\\nThe Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway came to Dinting in 1842, but it was the 13th Duke of Norfolk who built the spur line to Howard Town, so that coal could be brought from the collieries at Dukinfield. Glossop railway station bears the lion, the symbol of the Norfolks. Many of the street- and placenames in Glossop derive from the names and titles of the Dukes of Norfolk, such as Norfolk Square, and a cluster of residential streets off Norfolk Street that were named after Lord Henry Charles Fitzalan Howard, the 13th Duke of Norfolk, the first Catholic MP since the Reformation. (His second son was created 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and was ancestor of the post-1975 Dukes.)\\n\\nA two-storey Township Workhouse was built between 1832 and 1834 on Bute Street (). Its administration was taken over by Glossop Poor Law Union in December 1837. The workhouse buildings included a 40-bed infirmary, piggeries and casual wards for vagrants. The workhouse later became Glossop Public Assistance Institution and from 1948 the N.H.S. Shire Hill Hospital.\\n\\nThe mill owners, Catholics, Anglican, Methodist and Unitarian, built reading rooms and chapels. They worked together and worshipped together with their workers. The Woods, Sidebottoms and Shepleys were Anglicans and hence Tory, and they dominated every vestry, which was the only form of local government before 1866. They built four churches St James\\'s, Whitfield in 1846, St Andrew\\'s, Hadfield in 1874, Holy Trinity, Dinting in 1875 and St Luke\\'s, Glossop. Francis Sumner and the Ellisons and Norfolks were Catholic and built St Charles\\'s, Hadfield and St Mary\\'s, Glossop. The smaller mill owners were Dissenters and congregated at Littlemoor Independent Chapel built in Hadfield in 1811, but they later built a further eleven chapels.\\n\\nFor decades there was rivalry between Edward Partington, his friend Herbert Rhodes, and the Woods and Sidebottoms. The Woods built the public baths and laid out the park. Partington built the library. Partington built the cricket pavilion, so Samuel Hill-Wood sponsored the football club that for one season, 1889–1890, played in League Division One. He and his descendants went on to be chairmen of the London club, Arsenal. He was MP for High Peak from 1910–1929. Edward\\'s son, Oswald, was MP for High Peak from 1900–1910. Ann Kershaw Woods devoted herself to Anglican education and had schools built.\\n\\nSection::::Cotton famine and industrial relations.\\nIn 1851, 38% of the men and 27% of the women were employed in cotton; the only alternative employment was agriculture, building, or labouring on the railway. Consequently, the town was vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of cotton or the export trade. The American Civil War caused the cotton famine of 1861–64. The mill owners met together and put in place a relief programme through which they supplied food, clogs and coal to their employees. Howard increased the workforce on his estate, and public works (such as improving the domestic water supply) were undertaken. They provided unsecured loans to the workers until the cotton returned. The relationship between the owners and men was one of paternal benevolence. They lived in the same community and worshipped in the same churches. The mill owners were the local aldermen, the church elders and led the sports teams. In the Luddite and Chartist times and the period following Peterloo, Glossop was virtually unaffected, despite its proximity to Hyde, a radical hotbed. In the \\'4s 2d or swing strike\\' it was incomers from Ashton who stopped the Glossop mills. The rivalry in Glossop was not based on class, but on religious groups.\\n\\nSection::::Modern (20th and 21st centuries).\\nThe decline of cotton spinning has resulted in the closure of many of the town\\'s mills. The Howard family sold the Glossop Estate in 1925 and donated large areas to the people of Glossop. Manor Park was the location of the family\\'s manor house and gardens. The recession of 1929 hit Glossop very hard: in 1929 the unemployment rate was 14%, and in 1931 it was 55%. In Hadfield it reached 67%. National initiatives to improve housing and employment conditions largely failed, and mills fell empty and decayed. Unemployment remained at 36% in 1938. The Second World War changed this: military stores, metals, machine tools, munitions, rubber and essential industries moved into the empty factories and left Glossop with a more diverse range of industries.\\n\\nIn spite of the post-war Barlow Report and government intervention, no significant employer moved into Glossop.\\n\\nGamesley underwent considerable change in the 1960s, when a large council estate was built, mainly to house people from Manchester. These housing areas, called \\'Overspill estates\\', were also built in other towns surrounding Manchester.\\n\\nIn 2006 High Peak Borough Council granted planning permission for a local foam factory to store up to 120 tonnes of toluene diisocyanate. Further permissions granted in 2010 increased the amount to 280 tonnes. As a result of this, a Detailed Emergency Planning Zone and Extended Area of Risk were created, which encompasses Dinting, Hadfield and Gamesley, as well as parts of Padfield, Simmondley and Hollingworth.\\n\\nSection::::Plans.\\nGlossop has been included as pilot in the Liveability scheme, and has drawn up the Glossop Vision masterplan for the improvement and gentrification of the town. This is being partially funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. It aims to open up access to the Glossop Brook, to coordinate developments in Glossop town centre, to enhance the built environment and to link the town to its wider setting. As such, the mills have become a retail development with housing, trees are to be planted along the A57 and the market square has been pedestrianised.\\n\\nSection::::Governance.\\nIn the local government reorganisation of 1974 the Borough of Glossop was abolished, and since then the two levels of local government are Derbyshire County Council, based in Matlock, and High Peak Borough Council then based in Chapel-en-le-Frith.\\n\\nGlossop was included in the \"South East Lancashire Special Review Area\" under the Local Government Act 1958, and the Redcliffe-Maud Report of 1969 recommended its inclusion in a South East Lancashire–North East Cheshire metropolitan area. Glossop was not ultimately included in the Greater Manchester area established by the Local Government Act 1972. Local people voted to stay within the County of Derbyshire in 1973. The county council, originally based in Derby, moved to Matlock in the late 1950s to facilitate easier travelling to the county hall from the northern extremities such as Glossop and the High Peak.\\n\\nFor the county council Glossop is split between the divisions of Glossop and Charlesworth, and Etherow. Etherow division contains Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Gamesley and the large and sparsely populated Tintwistle ward, which was formerly in Cheshire. These boundaries were set in 2013.\\n\\nAt the district level, that is High Peak Borough Council, Glossop comprises these wards: Dinting, Gamesley, Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Old Glossop, Padfield, Howard Town, Simmondley and Whitfield. St John\\'s represents the rural area that was formerly Glossopdale RDC and lies within the National Park. These were the wards used in the 2001 Census.\\nGlossop itself does not have a parish council, but Tintwistle and St John\\'s are parished.\\n\\nThe Member of Parliament for the High Peak constituency since 2017 has been Ruth George MP, representing the Labour Party. Her majority in the 2017 general election was 2,322 over the Conservative candidate Andrew Bingham.\\n\\nSection::::Historic Glossop.\\nHistorically, the ancient parish of Glossop consisted of the ten townships of the manor: Glossop, Hadfield, Padfield, Dinting, Simmondley, Whitfield, Chunal, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Ludworth and nine more: Mellor, Thornsett, Rowarth, Whittle (Whitle), Beard, Ollersett, Hayfield, Little Hayfield, Phoside, Kinder, Bugsworth, Brownside and Chinley. Within the parish were the chapelries of Hayfield and Mellor. The ancient parish was in the Hundred of High Peak; it was about in length and wide, with an area of . Beard, Ollerset, Thornsett, Rowarth and Whitle later formed the town of New Mills, while Hayfield, Little Hayfield, Phoside and Kinder joined the parish of Hayfield. The chapelry of Mellor included Mellor, Chisworth, Ludworth, Whittle and part of Thornsett.\\n\\nThe Manor of Glossop was made up of the territory that includes Hadfield, Padfield, Dinting, Simmondley, Whitfield, Chunal, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Ludworth and the village of Glossop, now called Old Glossop. It had an area of , of which more than were classed as moorland.\\n\\nThe present community of Glossop is centred on Howardtown. It is served by the Glossopdale Area Forum and the Glossop Town Partnership.\\nThe previous hamlet of Glossop is now known as Old Glossop.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nGlossop is northwest of London, east of the city of Manchester, west of the city of Sheffield and north of Derby. It nestles in the foothills of the Pennines, with Bleaklow to the northeast and Kinder Scout to the south. It lies on Glossop Brook, a tributary of the River Etherow, in the area of peat moorland commonly known as the Dark Peak. The moors, which rise to over 1,960 ft, are cut by many deep V-shaped valleys known as cloughs, each formed by a stream known as a brook. Shelf Brook passes through Old Glossop where it joins Hurst Brook to form Glossop Brook, which passes westward through Milltown, Howard Town and Dinting to the River Etherow, which in turn runs south to join the River Goyt at Marple Bridge. Two other notable brooks are Padfield Brook and Gnat Hole Brook.\\n\\nShelf Brook leads from Shelf Moor on Bleaklow down Doctor\\'s Gate through Old Glossop to Glossop Brook. The valley was used by the Romans for a road, and currently contains a bridleway. The north slope of Holden Clough and Hurst Brook is used by the A57 road known as the Snake Pass. The Snake Pass crosses the Pennine Way near Doctor\\'s Gate Culvert (1,680 ft above sea level) before descending to the east to Ladybower Reservoir along the northern side of the River Ashop valley. Here a road leads east over Hallam Moor into Sheffield, and south along the River Derwent into Baslow and Matlock. To the north of Glossop is Tintwistle; the River Etherow is the boundary. Today, the Longdendale valley forms a chain of reservoirs that provide drinking water for Manchester. At the head of the valley is Woodhead, where the road from Huddersfield joins the road to Sheffield, and a three-mile railway tunnel brought the railway from Penistone.\\n\\nSection::::Geology.\\nDirectly beneath Glossop lie areas of Carboniferous Millstone Grit, shales and sandstone. Glossop is on the edge of the Peak District Dome, at the southern edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the peaty soils of the moors thus are acid (pH5.5–7.0); this means the instream wildlife is dependent on food sources from outside the channel.\\n\\nSection::::Climate.\\nGlossop experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. Glossop has a history of flash flooding, the most recent being in 2002 when High Street West was flooded to a depth of .\\n\\nSection::::Demography.\\nGlossop has been subject to frequent boundary changes, so different analyses can be made of the same raw datasets depending on how the \\'equivalent\\' area is interpreted, which may or may not bear the same name.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nGlossop was a product of the wealth of the cotton industry. Glossop\\'s economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition which had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Before the First World War, Glossop had the headquarters of an international paper empire, the largest calico printworks in the world, a large bleach works and six spinning weaving combines with over 600,000\\xa0spindles and 12,000\\xa0looms and two niche manufacturers: grindstones and industrial belts. In the 1920s, these firms were refloated on the easily available share capital—thus were victims of the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Their product lines were vulnerable to the new economic conditions.\\n\\nThe main street contains a variety of shops, restaurants and food outlets.\\n\\nGlossop is located close to the border of the Peak National Park, and to the east are the open moorlands of the Dark Peak. The local economy benefits from the many thousands of tourists who visit the park each year and who use Glossop as the \"Gateway to the Peak\".\\n\\nWren Nest Mill on High Street West was built c.\\xa01800–10, with further extensions in 1815 and 1818, the latter incorporating an octagonal tower. The present building is a small part of the original complex, which in its heyday employed 1,400 workers operating 123,000 spindles and 2,541 looms. It ceased trading in 1955. A major fire in 1996 destroyed half the mill. The remaining half has been redeveloped into flats and retail units.\\nFrom a group of small mills at Bridge End, John Wood built a complex of mills. Bridge End Mill was originally built in 1782 as a fulling mill. Today one mill building is being restored, and the Milltown mills lie idle.\\nGlossop Town Hall and Market House was designed in Italianate style by Sheffield architects Weightman and Hadfield. The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1838, the Coronation Day of Queen Victoria. The buildings were opened on 10 July 1845. Cost of construction exceeded £8,500. The facilities included a lock-up with four cells heated by hot water.\\nThe viaduct was built in 1845, and later reinforced with additional piers. An accident occurred in 1855, when an MS&LR passenger train was stopped by signalling on the viaduct at night. Two men and a woman mistook the parapet of the viaduct for the station platform at Hadfield, alighted from the train and fell 75 feet to their deaths.\\n\\nSection::::Landmarks.\\nThe present-day (2008) fabric of the parish church of All Saints is mostly of the 20th century; very little remains of the previous churches on this site.\\nThe first mention of a church in Glossop is in the charter of 1157 conferring the manor of Glossop on Basingwerk Abbey. Although the dedication of the church to All Saints may indicate an Anglo-Saxon origin, no trace of such a church has been found. The first recorded vicar is William, of 1252. At this time the church was probably aisleless. It was altered in the 15th century when the nave was rebuilt with arcades, aisles and a still extant (2008) arch at the east end of the north aisle. In 1554 a new and taller tower with a broach spire was built 3 feet west of the old tower, incorporating the east wall of the previous tower. The nave was completely rebuilt in 1831, with removal and replacement of much of the old fabric including the tracery of the aisle windows. The work was carried out by the firm of E. W. Drury of Sheffield, the cost far exceeding the initial estimate of £700. When the nave was rebuilt in 1914 it was discovered that the arch leading to the chancel had been partly made up of plaster, the wall supported by this arch had not been bonded into the existing chancel walls, and the \"oak\" roof bosses were also plaster. Between the pillars of the nave sleeper walls had been built to a higher level than the pillar bases. These walls appear to have been needed to counteract the effects on the church structure of a combination of excess drainage from the nearby hillside and the numerous burials inside the church. The pillars of the new nave of 1914 were superimposed on the bases of the old pillars, and the floor built up to cover the sleeper walls.\\n\\nThe tower and chancel were demolished and rebuilt in 1853–55, the new tower also having a broach spire. The chancel was again rebuilt in 1923, completing the architect C. M. Hadfield\\'s plan of 1914. The present church has a nave of 5 bays, 25 yards long by 16 yards wide, with north and south aisles, and a chancel of 14 yards by 7 yards with a north aisle dedicated as St Catherine\\'s Chapel.\\n\\nTwo public open spaces in Glossop have been given the Green Flag award: Manor Park close to the town centre, which has views of the surrounding countryside, and Howard Park, which was described by the Award organisation as \"a good example of visionary layout from the Victorian era retaining many original features\". Glossop\\'s parkrun takes place in Manor Park every Saturday at 9am. Harehills Park, with its riverside footpath and mature trees, has been identified by Glossop Vision as a strategic open space, and was donated by the 2nd Lord Howard of Glossop as a First World War memorial.\\n\\nSection::::Transport.\\nSection::::Roads.\\nThe main road through Glossop is the A57. To the west, this road (with the parallel M67 motorway) leads to Manchester, while Sheffield and the Hope Valley lie to the east, via the Snake Pass. The B6105 leads north then east, along the Woodhead Pass (A628) and eventually to the South Yorkshire town of Barnsley and the M1 motorway. Chapel-en-le-Frith, Buxton and Derby lie to the south, along the A624 and A6.\\n\\nSection::::Public transport.\\nPublic transport is coordinated by Derbyshire County Council, with the exception of rail travel and some bus services being provided by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM).\\n\\nSection::::Rail.\\nThere are regular half-hour train services, increasing to every 20 minutes during rush hour, from Glossop railway station to Manchester Piccadilly station and Hadfield railway station along the remaining stub of the former Woodhead Line.\\nA user group, the Friends of Glossop Station, are working to make the station more attractive and to encourage greater use of public transport. The trains operated on the line are three-car Class 323 electric multiple units built in 1992–1993 by Hunslet TPL.\\n\\nSection::::Buses.\\nThere are regular bus services running to towns in Tameside, to Buxton, New Mills and Whaley Bridge.\\n\\nThe majority of bus services in Glossop are operated by Stagecoach Manchester and High Peak.\\n\\nSection::::Schools and further education.\\nIt will be noticed that a large proportion of the primary education is provided by the faith schools.\\n\\nSection::::Sport.\\nGlossop is the smallest town in England to have had a team in the top tier of the English football league system. Glossop North End were members of the Football League between 1898 and 1915, and around the turn of the 20th century played in Division One. The team now plays in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division. In the 2008–09 season they reached the final of the FA Vase at Wembley Stadium on 10 May 2009. To mark this achievement, Arsenal (with whom they retain connections due to Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood\\'s grandfather Sir Samuel Hill-Wood having owned and bankrolled Glossop during their run in the Football League) invited them to their state-of-the-art London Colney training ground during their stay in London, to prepare for the final. Glossop lost 2–0 to Northern League First Division side Whitley Bay.\\n\\nSection::::Culture.\\nSection::::Performing arts.\\nPartington Theatre is an amateur theatre with a 120-seat venue in the centre of the town. It runs six plays each season and was established in 1954. The building was started in 1914 and completed in 1917. \\n\\nGlossop Operatic and Dramatic Society is an amateur musical/drama society established in 1976. \\n\\nGlossop & District Choral Society is a community choir founded in 1949 by Margaret Lomas.\\n\\nSection::::Community events.\\nGlossop Victorian Weekend was the biggest weekend event in Glossop and was featured on the BBC\\'s \"Songs of Praise\". The weekend included many activities, including a Grand Victorian Costume Competition and a Shop Window Competition. The Victorian Weekend was discontinued in 2009 due to lack of local support. Running parallel with the Victorian Weekend was Glossop Beer Festival, run by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) and featuring over 30 beers and a barbecue in Glossop\\'s Labour Club.\\n\\nIn recent years, Glossop has become quite well known musically for staging jazz and world music festivals. \\n\\nGlossop has a range of other cultural activities including Peak Film Society, a film club. Many other activities, including Glossop Folk Club take place at Glossop Labour Club. Also at Glossop Labour Club is the monthly Glossop Record Club, which holds vinyl listening sessions on the second Thursday of each month.\\n\\nGlossop has a thriving indoor and outdoor market where a wide selection of goods can be purchased. The indoor market is open every Thursday, Friday and Saturday, while the outdoor market is open every Friday and Saturday. The Outdoor Market is joined by the Local Produce Market on the 2nd Saturday of every month throughout the year.\\n\\nThe Crown Inn public house at 142 Victoria Street, built in the 1840s, is on the Campaign for Real Ale\\'s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.\\n\\nSection::::Emergency service provision.\\nCalls for service in the rural areas usually increase during the summer as the population is boosted by approximately twenty million visitors each year to the Peak District and its surrounds. Winter weather on the high ground around Glossop and Kinder Scout can also cause problems for traffic and residents.\\n\\nState healthcare is provided for in Glossop and District by Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group. This NHS trust operates Tameside General Hospital, a foundation hospital, in Ashton-under-Lyne. The Commissioning Group serves two separate communities because there are no district general hospitals (hospitals with Accident and Emergency Department) within the borough of High Peak, and patients would have to travel over 20 miles to another hospital within the county.\\nThe North West Ambulance Service, and occasionally the East Midlands Ambulance Service, provides emergency medical services for the town from its Chapel Street Ambulance Station.\\n\\nWhen Glossop was granted Municipal Borough Status in 1867, the Watch Committee elected to implement its own police force. Glossop Police remained independent until 1947 when they amalgamated with the Derbyshire Constabulary. The police station on Ellison Street is staffed by statutory police officers from B Division of Derbyshire Constabulary. It has a custody suite, five cells and an incident room. There are also a team of volunteer special constables and six police community support officers.\\n\\nGeneral fire and rescue cover is provided by the Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. Specialised search and rescue services are provided by the volunteer Glossop Mountain Rescue Team, part of the Peak District Mountain Rescue Organisation. Their remit is to \\'save lives in the mountains and moorlands\\'.\\n\\n<br>\\nSection::::Twin town.\\nBad Vilbel is a spa town in the Wetteraukreis district of Hesse, Germany, northeast of Frankfurt.\\n\\nIn 1985 the Glossop–Bad Vilbel Twinning Association was established. Its aims are:\\n\\nTo promote and foster friendship and understanding between the people of Glossop and district and those of Bad Vilbel and district in Germany.\\n\\nTo encourage visits by individuals and groups to and from the linked towns, particularly by children and young people, and the development of personal contacts, and by doing so to broaden the mutual understanding of the cultural, recreational, educational and commercial activities of the linked towns.\\nIn 1987 formal twinning ceremonies were held in both towns, with a tree being planted in Norfolk Square. The Twinning Association arranges for visitors to stay with families.\\nThe two signatories of the charter were Cllr Catherine Holtom, the Mayor of High Peak, and Herr Gunther Biwer, Bürgermeister of Bad Vilbel.\\n\\nSection::::Literature and the media.\\nHilaire Belloc wrote about Glossop in a letter to a Miss Hamilton in 1909: \"Do you know the filthy village of Glossop? It is inhabited entirely by savages. I tried every inn in the place and found each inn worse than the last. It stinks for miles. Rather than sleep in such a den I started walking back to Manchester with a huge bag...\"\\n\\nGlossop is mentioned in the satirical book \"England, Their England\" by A. G. Macdonell. The town\\'s fictional newspaper, the \"Glossop Evening Mail\", is described as the lowest rung in the journalistic profession.\\n\\nThe television comedy \"The League of Gentlemen\" is filmed in neighbouring Hadfield. Students from Glossopdale Community College have appeared as extras in two shows. In one they were the audience to the Legz Akimbo theatre group in a play about homosexuality, and in the second they appeared as German students on an exchange program with their teacher, Herr Lipp. In 2013, Old Glossop was used for filming in the BBC drama series \"The Village\", starring John Simm and Maxine Peake. The Parish Church of All Saints and the former Duke of Norfolk school building appeared in the series.\\n\\nLocal media includes the \"Glossop Advertiser\" newspaper owned by the \"Manchester Evening News\", the \"Glossop Chronicle\", the \"Buxton Advertiser\", the \"Glossop Gazette\", Glossop Community Radio and High Peak Radio.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Glossop', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113553', 'cat_id': '113553', 'cat_title': 'Drake_Bell_albums', 'cat_pages': '5', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '-RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11356093', 'text': 'Volodymyr Yavorivsky\\n\\nVolodymyr Oleksandrovych Yavorivsky () is a Ukrainian poet, writer, journalist and politician.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nBorn in 1942 in Crijopol raion of Jugastru county (today part of Vinnytsia Oblast), Yavorivsky graduated from the Odessa State University as a specialist on \"Ukrainian language and literature\".

BSAVE copies RAM to a binary file, and BLOAD copies the contents of the file to RAM. The term \"BSAVE image\" could mean any of various raw image formats of video display controllers, or more generally any file containing the raw contents of a section of memory.\\n\\nSome platforms provided a BRUN command that, after loading the file into memory, would immediately attempt to execute it as machine code.\\n\\nThere is no file compression, and therefore these files load very quickly and without much programming when displayed in native mode.\\n\\nBSAVE files were in general use as a file format when the IBM PC was introduced. It was also in general use on the Apple II in the same time period. Although the commands were available on the Commodore PET line, they were removed from the later (and more popular) Commodore 64 and VIC-20 computers. In 1985 the Commodore 128 was released with Commodore BASIC version 7.0 which restored the BSAVE and BLOAD commands.\\n\\nSection::::Origin.\\nThe BASIC programming language was shipped as part of the operating system on the first IBM PCs, Apple and Commodore 8-bit (like Commodore 64/128) computers. On computers that did not start up in BASIC, BASIC was loaded by manually running the BASIC interpreter. The user could then type BASIC commands in direct mode or by creating and/or running a numbered BASIC program within the interpreter.\\n\\nOne of the commands that early BASIC offered was BSAVE (Binary Save) and another (complementary) command was BLOAD (Binary Load). Using the BSAVE command, an addressable area and length of memory could be saved to disk as a named file (referred to as an \"Image\"). This \"Image\" of saved memory could then be reloaded from disk into addressable memory later with the BLOAD command. If the BSAVEd image contained program code it could be executed, if data it could be used again, and if the BSAVEd image contained graphics it could be viewed. The video area of memory was addressable.\\n\\nThe PUT and GET commands were used in addition to the BSAVE and BLOAD commands on the IBM PC to allow \"clips\" of the screen (or the entire screen) to be pre-formatted for BSAVE and BLOAD. These commands added image height and width to the BSAVE format, and were later carried over into the C programming language by some compiler vendors for the MS-DOS platform as the putimage() and getimage() run-time library functions. PUT and GET allowed display modifier verbs which resembled functions in the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) used by programmers later.\\n\\nMicrosoft produced the BASIC interpreters that were bundled with the IBM PC, Apple II, and Commodore PET, and included the ability to BSAVE and BLOAD RAM images on all 3 platforms.\\n\\nSection::::Historical use.\\nIt was possible for computer users of the day (most who knew how to program in BASIC to some degree) to use the BLOAD command to load a graphics image that had been BSAVED in addition to loading a BSAVED executable or data image.\\n\\nMost early drawing programs allowed their graphics images to be BSAVED, making them easily available by an average user to be BLOADED back into video memory and viewed in a simple external program written in BASIC.\\n\\nCommon use of BSAVED images in graphics programs continued well into the 1990s but their use was primarily limited to users of programs like the freeware program PicEM and the Shareware program VGACAD (which saved the MCGA display to a BSAVED file format called BLD BLoaDablepicture), and by beginning programmers and enthusiasts.\\n\\nWith the passing of MS-DOS so did the use of DOS programs that saved in the BSAVED format.\\nTheir use by programmers has stopped because the BLOAD command is no longer supported in modern programming languages which discourage accessing video memory directly.\\n\\nSection::::Video images.\\nThe BSAVED format is a device-dependent raster image format; the file header sometimes stores information about the display hardware address, and the size of the graphics data.\\nThe graphics data follows the header directly and is stored as raw data in the format of the native adapter\\'s addressable memory.\\n\\nNo additional information, such as screen resolution, color depth and palette information, bit planes and so on, is stored. Video adapters were simple when this format was in wide use and the other information necessary to display the image could usually be inferred by programs that loaded such files.\\n\\nSection::::IBM PC compatible.\\nSection::::CGA.\\nCGA memory starts at memory segment B800h offset 0. Up to 16K of memory is available for video.\\n\\nThe amount of memory used for display depends on the video mode selected. A graphics screen requires 16000 bytes of memory and an 80 x 25 text screen requires 4000 bytes. A 40 x 25 text screen requires 2000 bytes.\\n\\nThe 3 common video modes are monochrome graphics, 4-color graphics or 80 column x 25 row color text.\\n\\nA low-resolution 160 x 100 x 16 color graphics mode unofficially called \"XCGA\" and not supported in BIOS (interrupt 10h) also existed and had limited popularity amongst enthusiasts for a while. Technically this mode worked like color text mode. (see Color Graphics Adapter.)\\n\\n40 column text mode was not generally used for BSAVED images.\\n\\nSection::::CGA text.\\n80 column text is stored in 4 pages of 4000 bytes each. Generally only page 1 was used for BSAVED text images. Each character in an 80 column x 25 row text screen is stored in a contiguous byte array of character, attribute pairs of 2 bytes per text character. The attribute byte stores the foreground color in the low nibble and the background color and blink attribute in the high nibble. The colors 0-16 correspond to the colors offered in text mode by the CGA.\\n\\nThese could be cross-loaded to a low-end monochrome text video display with only 4K of memory with varying degrees of success since the color attributes on monochrome displayed differently.\\n\\nThe file extension that became popular for the BSaved text screen format was .BSV.\\n\\nIn the BBS days before the Internet was widely used, many sysops used a program called TheDraw from TheSoft Programming Services in Fremont, CA as the tool-of-choice to design and build user interface screens. Programmers used TheDraw to design text-based user interfaces, or to edit screens that had been captured from other text programs, and then often would display these edited screens in their own programs, or as slideshows for proof-of-concept and so-forth. TheDraw saved in various formats including BSAVED with the default file extension of .BSV.\\n\\nSection::::Header.\\nThe following C language source code documents the header and tailer in a BSAVED text image:\\nSection::::Example.\\nBy contrast the following tiny GWBASIC program demonstrates how easy it was to load these in BASIC.\\n\\nSection::::Graphics.\\nThe CGA video card (and other IBM PC video cards which support CGA which until recently were almost all) has two interleafs when in monochrome or 4-color Graphics mode. Visible memory is 16,000 bytes. There is 192 bytes of unused data between the first and second interleaf, and 192 bytes of unused data following the second interleaf. The byte array is identical for either mode.\\n\\nSection::::Typical variations.\\nFile Size 16,392 bytes\\nHeader Size 7 bytes\\nFirst Interleaf 8000 bytes\\nUnused 192 Bytes\\nSecond Interleaf 8000 bytes\\nUnused 192 Bytes\\nTailer Size 1 byte\\n\\nVariations on the above include a smaller BSaved file format that does not load the unused memory after the second interleaf, nor the traditional trailer byte 0x1a (CPM EOF). This resulted in a slight saving of disk space.\\n\\nFile Size 16,199 bytes\\nHeader Size 7 bytes\\nFirst Interleaf 8000 bytes\\nUnused 192 Bytes\\nSecond Interleaf 8000 bytes\\n\\nA variation of the BSAVED CGA Image used by the earliest version of PCPaint stored a signature followed by a 2 byte palette index in the unused area directly following the first interleaf.\\n\\nBSAVED CGA images were usually saved with a .PIC extension.\\n\\nSection::::Pixel data.\\nMonochrome data is stored as 1 bit per pixel with pixel(0,0) (x,y) being the high bit in the first byte and pixel(0,7) being the low bit in the first byte. The horizontal resolution for a monochrome CGA image is 640 pixels.\\n\\nColor data is stored as 2 bits per pixel with pixel(0,0) (x,y) being the 2 highest bits in the first byte and pixel(0,3) being the 2 lowest bit in the first byte. The horizontal resolution for a monochrome CGA image is 640 pixels. The nominal color values are either BLACK, CYAN, MAGENTA, WHITE or BLACK, GREEN, RED, and ORANGE in color order depending on which of the two palettes was selected, with variations on border color (color 0). A third palette was available on some cards as well with nominal values of BLACK, CYAN, RED, WHITE. The horizontal resolution for a monochrome CGA image is 320 pixels.\\n\\nThe interleaf breaks on 80 byte boundaries which means that byte[80] is displayed starting at pixel(2,0), and conversely byte[8192] is displayed starting at pixel(1,0), and so it goes. Both color and monochrome have a vertical resolution of 200 scanlines.\\n\\nSection::::Cross-loading.\\nBecause the monochrome and color images could be cross-loaded, a color image displayed in monochrome would be naturally dithered because of the bit alteration provided by the bit pairs in colors 1 and 2. Color 0 was still BLACK and color 3 was still WHITE. This dithering was fairly good for printouts of color images on the black-and-white printers of the day.\\nMonochrome images displayed in color did not do so well. The aliasing of pixels that were not paired on bit boundaries created CYAN and MAGENTA anomalies which usually looked terrible.\\n\\nSection::::Header.\\nThe following C language source code documents the header and tailer in a BSAVED graphics image:\\nSection::::Example.\\nThe following GWBASIC program shows by how easy it was to load and save these in BASIC. It loads an existing image, draws a border around it and saves it.\\nSection::::XCGA low-resolution graphics.\\nThe Color Graphics Adapter page elsewhere on Wikipedia calls this mode \"The 160×100 16 color mode\".\\n\\nXCGA mode as it was known as in the late 1980s enjoyed a brief notoriety amongst enthusiasts but never served any practical purpose because it was too coarse for even for the primitive graphics of the day.\\n\\nEven so, computers equipped only with a CGA video adapter were still prevalent, with users who wanted to display graphics in more than the 4 color maximum that CGA graphics offered.\\n\\nXCGA images were generally created by reducing images produced in higher resolution to a lower resolution facsimile by the use of file conversion software. This was generally done by enthusiasts as more of a novelty than for any real purpose.\\n\\nBSAVED XCGA Images were usually saved with a .CGX extension.\\n\\nSection::::Memory.\\nThe memory on XCGA was a contiguous byte array (just like MCGA mode) and was not interleaved like other CGA graphics modes. It started at memory segment B800 like all CGA video memory, and displaying the first 16,000 bytes of the segment.\\n\\nSection::::Header.\\nThe BSAVED image header was the same as the other CGA BSAVED headers, but the data length was 16000.\\n\\nSection::::Pixel data.\\nPixels were in a raw format, arranged in pixel pairs called \"big pixels\" with 2 bytes per each 2 pixel-color pair stored in a contiguous byte array of 8000 big pixels.\\n\\nSince XCGA was technically a color text mode, the first byte in a big pixel was actually the top two scanlines of a \"text graphics\" character in video ROM. As in color text mode the second byte stored the foreground color in the low nibble and the background color in the high nibble. (see Color Graphics Adapter.)\\n\\nThe colors 0-16 correspond to the colors offered in text mode, and also to those offered by the EGA in its 16-color graphic modes.\\n\\nBy selecting the appropriate 2 pixel text block graphics character from the video ROM, even though the technical resolution was 80 x 100, the effective resolution was 160 x 100. Figure 2 above uses the same graphics character normally used in an XCGA image to display a graphic in standard color text mode\\n\\nEach scanline was 160 bytes long.\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nThe following QuickBasic source code shows how a low resolution BSAVED Image with 16 Colors was displayed. The commands are the same as displaying BSAVE images in standard CGA graphics or text modes with the addition of setting of registers on the CGA\\'s MC6845 CRT controller.\\nSection::::EGA and VGA.\\nBSAVE images using multiple color planes and color registers were not common but they did exist.\\n\\nAdditional program code was needed to save and display these which was more complicated than the average user of the day could easily write. The EGA was relatively expensive, and typically used for high-end workstations; by the time low-cost VGA cards came out fewer users experimented with BASIC, and anyway usually preferred to use the lower-resolution 256-color MCGA mode.\\n\\nSection::::MCGA.\\nMulti-Color Graphics Array (MCGA) had two additional video modes beyond CGA. BSAVE images using 256 colors and color palettes were not common but they did exist.\\n\\nThe MCGA was organized in one contiguous byte array of 64,000 bytes each with a value of 0–255, and each representing a pixel. Loading and saving these was virtually the same as the CGA Bsaved format with the difference being that additional program code was needed to save and restore the color palettes.\\n\\nTwo MS-DOS based utilities, PICEm and VGACad, offered saving of BSAVE MCGA images, with the latter also offering a BSAVE-style palette save. VGACad used the file extensions .BLD (BLoaDablePicture) and .PLT.\\n\\nThe color palette was most easily saved with some understanding of the graphics card\\'s registers. If the programmer did put effort into this, it usually was not very long before that understanding extended to more capable languages than BASIC and more advanced graphics formats than the BSAVE format.\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nThe following QuickBASIC program shows how to load these in BASIC. The amount of code is substantially larger than in the CGA equivalent.\\n\\nSection::::Apple II.\\nSection::::Low-resolution graphics (GR).\\nThe Apple II had two \"low resolution\" (lo-res) graphics screen pages which allowed the simultaneous display of 16 colors at a very coarse resolution (40 x 48). This display mode was really too coarse for \"meaningful\" graphics display although Apple computer provided an excellent kaleidescope demo called \"Rod\\'s Color Pattern\" to promote its use. Further, since this area of memory (also shared with the text display) was non-contiguous and the Apple II made use of the \"memory holes\" at the sides of the display for other purposes like mouse support, it was not practical to \"BLoad\" previously saved graphics images because they would \"clobber\" these \"memory holes\" that may be required for other processes.\\n\\nSection::::High-resolution graphics (HGR).\\nThe Apple II had two \"high-resolution\" graphics screen pages: \"page 1\" (occupying the 8 kB of memory beginning at 0x2000) and \"page 2\" (immediately following at 0x4000). It also had two commonly used \"high-resolution\" graphics modes: \"graphics only\" (\"pure\" graphics mode) and \"mixed text and graphics\" (only offering a partial display of a graphics image with the bottom 4 lines of the respective text \"page 1\" or \"page 2\" at the bottom, leaving only the first 160 lines of the graphics screen visible).\\n\\nThe Apple II \"high-resolution\" (hi-res) graphics mode could be invoked from AppleSoft BASIC with the HGR and HGR2 commands. HGR enabled hi-res page 1 (occupying the 8 kB of memory beginning at 0x2000) with the bottom 4 lines of text page 1 at the bottom. HGR2 enabled hi-res page 2 (immediately following at 0x4000) with no text area showing. A POKE command could be used to independently enable or disable the text area on either page—though text page 2 was rarely used in BASIC, and BASIC programs normally loaded into its memory.\\n\\nWhen ProDOS SYS programs were introduced (written in programming languages other than BASIC; like Assembler, C or Pascal) it was common to use \"page 2\" graphics only because SYS programs loaded at 0x2000 which conflicted with \"page 1\".\\n\\nSection::::Resolution.\\nThe resolution of an Apple II hi-res graphics screen was 280 pixels x 192 rasters and allowed (on very early Apple II\\'s) up to 4 colors to be displayed simultaneously. The hardware generated color by exploiting the nature of composite color video, essentially fooling the monitor into interpreting color from the pixel positions of an otherwise monochrome bitmap. This frugal design kept the hardware simple, but led to limitations as to what colors could be adjacent to each other on a line.\\nFurthermore, as of the second version of the Apple II (non-plus) motherboard (also very early-on), horizontal groups of 7 pixels could be shifted by one half pixel, allowing 2 more colors (and a redundant white and black). The new colors and the original colors could not coexist within the same 7 pixel group.\\n\\nAlthough not invented as a memory saving measure, the Apple II display design allowed a 6 color image to be displayed in only 8K of video memory despite the fact that colors would \"bleed\" (artifact) into each other if the pixels were incompatibly arranged. \\n\\nSection::::File format.\\nThe 8 kB hi-res frame buffer (like all 8-bit Apple II video modes), due to another logic chip conserving idiosyncrasy, was interleaved, and in blocks of 128 bytes, with 8 byte non-displayed \"holes\" in between. Under Apple DOS all binary files had a header of 4 bytes (2 integers representing the address and length of the save). However, since one of the holes was at the very end of the buffer, it could safely be omitted from the save, keeping the entire package inside of 8 kB (with 4 bytes to spare), which avoided the file taking another 256 byte block just for those 4 bytes of metadata. Under ProDOS the metadata is stored in the directory entry, so is not even an issue.\\n\\nVarious prefixes and suffices (such as \"PIC\", \"HPIC\", or \"HGR\") were used to indicate that the file was a graphics screen save. ProDOS had a special \"fotofile\" filetype (inherited from Apple SOS) of identical format. Unfortunately awareness of it was low, and few programs supported it.\\n\\nSection::::Rasters (scanlines).\\nThe rasters in an Apple II BSAVED image are not contiguous, nor are they in a simple sequential order. They match the video memory on the Apple II which was relatively complicated, and are arranged as follows:\\n\\nEach scanline is 40 bytes long. There are 3 parent interleaves of 64 scanlines each. Starting at the beginning of the image file, scanlines are arranged in 128 byte blocks beginning with scanlines 0, 64, and 128 in the first block (see table below). 8 bytes at the end of each block are unused by the image.\\n\\nEach parent interleaf has 8 child interleaves of 8 scanlines each, with a spacing of 1024 bytes (1K) between sequential scanlines in each of the 3 parent interleaves.\\n\\nStarting at the beginning of the file and respective of the Apple II\\'s interleaved display, the first 8 of the 128 byte blocks run as shown below. This also represents the first of 8 scanlines in each of the 24 child interleaves, and is effectively a block group. 8 of these block groups are stored in the file, with the scanlines in the table below being incremented by 1 for each subsequent block group sequence of 1024 bytes, totalling 8192 bytes (8K) of graphics image data.\\n\\nBecause of the interleaved display and the slow processor speed of the Apple II, when these loaded, a visible \"venetian blind\" effect was produced creating a \"wipe\" (fade effect) of the previous graphic if any.\\n\\nSection::::Pixels (colors).\\nThe colors in an Apple II BSAVED image are Black, Green, Violet, Orange, Blue, and White. Pixel color is represented by 2 bits. Although the nominal resolution is 280 x 192, the effective resolution considering colors is really only 140 x 192.\\n\\nIn a 40 byte scanline pixels are stored in an bit array of 280 pixel positions referred to as \"columns\". The highest bit of each byte is used as a \"palette\" bit and is not considered a column. The lowest bit represents the first column in the byte. So a scan line beginning with $03 would have the first two pixel positions set as white (with the next 5 pixels black).\\n\\nIf the palette bit in a byte is set, the 4 colors available for the pixels in that byte are black, blue, orange, and white.\\n\\nIf the palette bit is not set, the 4 colors available for the pixels in that byte are black, violet, green, and white\\n\\nIgnoring the 40 palette bits in a 40 byte scanline, there are 280 columns (bits, pixel positions) but only 140 available pixels. So considering each pixel as being a column pair, with an even and odd column, from left to right starting at column 0, if even is set and odd is not set, the pixel is blue or violet. If even is not set and odd is set, the pixel is orange or green. Any two adjacent columns that are set will be white. This means that white pixels (and black pixels) can be positioned at more places than the other colors, but does not alter the fact that the effective resolution is really only 140 x 192 for an Apple II BSAVED image.\\n\\nSection::::BLOAD example.\\nTo BLOAD a previously BSAVED image, use the Apple DOS/ProDOS command:\\n\\nThe following AppleSoft BASIC program loads a BSAVED Apple II Graphics Screen under Apple DOS 3.3. First it clears the screen, lists a directory, waits for user input (the BSAVED screen name) and then loads the screen and waits for a keypress, and repeats until the user ends the program.\\nSection::::BSAVE example.\\nTo BSAVE the HGR screen (starting at memory location $2000, for a length of $1FF8) use the Apple DOS/ProDOS command:\\nTo BSAVE the HGR2 screen (starting at memory location $4000, for a length of $1FF8) use the Apple DOS/ProDOS command:\\n\\nSection::::Commodore 64 and 128.\\nThe sample screens shown above were converted from the 4 Color BSAVED Image in Figure 1:. Due to the lower resolutions in both the Commodore\\'s standard native graphics display modes, Figure 6: sacrifices colors to black and white where needed during conversion resulting in color loss. The colors remain intact when converting to the lower resolution 4 color mode, but some detail is lost.\\n\\nSection::::Graphics.\\nStrictly speaking all the uncompressed Graphics File Formats on the Commodore 64 (C64) and 128 (C128) (and there were many) were in a variation of the BSAVE graphics image format because the Commodore stored all binary files (including Graphics) with a two-byte header which provided the file\\'s originating load address. However, because most of these could not be BLoaded directly into the video areas of the C128 they really are a little too advanced to be considered as BSaved graphics images in the same context as on the IBM-PC and Apple II computers of the same vintage.\\n\\nC64\\'s did not provide a BSAVE nor a BLOAD command with their version of the Commodore BASIC language (Version 2). It was not until the release of Commodore BASIC 7 on the C128 that the BSAVE and BLOAD commands and the BSAVE graphics image format came into existence on the C128.\\n\\nC64\\'s BASIC did provide a LOAD command which was intended to LOAD binary program files, data files, and BASIC programs, but this command when used in a C64 BASIC program to load binary data files like BSAVE images needed to restart the BASIC program after the (\"non-relocating\") load.\\n\\nThis lack of support for loading binary data files from a BASIC program without restarting the program itself amounted to a very serious shortcoming in C64 BASIC Version 2 (later corrected by the C128\\'s BLOAD command) which left the C64 user with the option writing a program that could be restarted after the (\"non-relocating\") load, or the option of slowly reading binary data files one byte at a time, and then moving the data to memory one byte at a time with data conversion further slowing-down the process.\\n\\nTechnically the standard HIRES graphics mode on the C128 was the same as on the C64 except that the default address in RAM where videoram (HIRES colors) are stored on the C128 directly preceded the default screen address (unlike the C64). This made loading a single BSAVE graphic file in either a monochrome or color format (of the uncompressed type produced by DOODLE) possible on the C128.\\n\\nSection::::Resolution and pixel blocks.\\nThe two primary graphics mode resolutions that both the C64 and C128 shared were 320 x 200 (HIRES) and 160 x 200 (Multi-Color Mode). Both modes provided selection of colors from a standard built-in palette of colors.\\n\\nIn HIRES mode, the screen was broken-down in blocks of 8 pixels x 8 scanlines. Pixels of two colors from the 16 color palette could be displayed in each block.\\n\\nIn Multi-Color Mode, the screen was broken down in blocks of 4 pixels x 8 scanlines. Pixels of 4 colors from the 16 color palette could be displayed in each block.\\n\\nHowever, because only 2 colors could be stored in the standard memory area shared by HIRES mode, a separate area of RAM was used to store the other two colors which was not contiguous with the default screen address and which was fixed (even the C128). This meant that a separate BSAVE file containing the remaining 2 colors was required to BSAVE and BLOAD these on the C128 (keeping in mind that the C64 did not support the BSaved format).\\n\\nThis is somewhat similar to the loading of multiple BSaved files on the IBM PC\\'s EGA, VGA, and MCGA Modes discussed above.\\n\\nSection::::File format.\\nThe size of a HIRES Monochrome BSAVE image without the two byte header was 8000 bytes (the same size as visible screen memory), and was \"linearized\". The many file extensions possible included .HIR and .HBM, if a file extension was used at all.\\n\\nThe size of a HIRES Color BSAVE image (of the uncompressed type produced by DOODLE) was 9024 bytes (the same size as videoram plus visible screen memory) without the two byte header, and was \"linearized\". The file extension was .DD, if a file extension was used at all.\\n\\nOther variations of HIRES and even Multi-Color BSaved formats could be produced from compatible graphics formats by splitting them into uncompressed pieces with BLoadable addresses. If a split graphics image was used it was generally split into an 8000 byte bitmap and 1000 byte videoram (2 colors) for HIRES mode, and with a third file, a 1000 byte colorram (2 colors), for Multi-Color Mode.\\n\\nLike all BIN (Binary) files on the C64 and C128, the files had a binary header of 2 bytes (1 integer). The header gave the load address for the file, and the length was already known to BASIC 7. The default load addresses on the C128 were $2000, $1C00, and $D800 for bitmap, videoram, and colorram respectively.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the popular uncompressed Multi-Color (4 Color) formats produced by the Paintbrush programs of the day could not be BLoaded without splitting them (in a separate program) and performing an additional operation of putting a background color which was stored elsewhere in the originating file into the 1000 high-nibbles of colorram.\\n\\nSince the screen address on the C64 and C128 was relocatable, the screen address could be detected and used by the loader program when BLoading these split files.\\n\\nSection::::Rasters (scanlines).\\nThe rasters in a C128 BSAVED image are not contiguous, but are in a simple sequential order of pixel blocks (as noted above). They match the video memory on the C128 which in its standard modes was uncomplicated except for its pixel block orientation.\\n\\nBecause of the slow processor speed of the C128 combined with slow storage access, when a HIRES image loaded it was displayed in 25 passes of 40 chunks creating a choppy effect. If the HIRES image had colors it was often blurry and not recognizable since the colors loaded after the image was already being displayed leaving the user with nothing to do but wait until it was finished.\\n\\nSection::::Pixels (colors).\\nThe standard available colors in a C128 image are BLACK, WHITE, RED, CYAN,\\nPURPLE, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, ORANGE, BROWN, LIGHT RED,DARK GREY,MEDIUM GREY,LIGHT GREEN, LIGHT BLUE,and LIGHT GREY. Pixel color is represented by 2 bits in HIRES mode and 4 bits in Multi Color Mode. But as indicated above, not all 16 Colors can be displayed in a pixel block.\\n\\nSection::::BLOAD equivalent example on C64.\\nThe BLOAD command did not exist on the C64. Instead a BASIC program could use a \"non-relocating\" LOAD command to load BSAVED Graphics if it was designed to restart after the load, as demonstrated in the following Commodore BASIC 2 program. It loads a colored BSAVED HIRES Graphics Screen on the C64 from 2 separate BSaved Files (a split image), waits for a keypress and ends.\\n\\nThe load address in the 2 files of $2000 for bitmap and $400 for videoram respectively are in the file headers and are used by the LOAD command to read the files directly into the C64\\'s RAM.\\n\\nCompared to BASIC 7 on the C128 (see C128 examples also below), the C64\\'s BASIC 2 was somewhat less straightforward.\\n\\nA second (and slower) alternative shown below which does not require a program restart is to open the BSAVED Graphic as a file. The program example below is functionally the same as the one above.\\n\\nSection::::BLOAD example on C128.\\nThe following Commodore BASIC 7 program loads a codice_1d high-resolution monochrome graphics screen on the C128, then sets each of the colors for the 1000 pixel blocks to black and white, waits for a keypress, and ends. No colors are stored in the image. The image is loaded at the start of the high-resolution screen, $2000.\\n\\nThe following Commodore BASIC 7 program loads a codice_1d high-resolution color graphics screen in DOODLE! uncompressed format on the C128, waits for a keypress, and ends. The image is loaded at the start of the 128\\'s high-resolution color RAM, at $1C00, directly before the high-resolution graphics screen, at $2000. No color setting is required, since the colors are stored in the image.\\n\\nThe following Commodore BASIC 7 program loads a codice_1d multicolor 4-color graphics screen in 3 separate codice_1d files (a split image) on the C128, waits for a keypress, and ends. The three files are loaded at $2000 for the bitmap, $1C00 for colors 1 and 2, and $D800 in codice_5 15 for color 3. No color setting is required.\\n\\nSection::::Bitmap converter example.\\nThe following C language source code is part of a Windows Program written in Microsoft C and the WIN32 SDK. It demonstrates how a monochrome bitmap in a standard format can be reorganized to display as a BSaved Image on the Commodore 128 (C128).\\n\\nPrograms that convert bitmaps with colors to a C128 HIRES or Multi-Color compatible format use the same basic logic as the example below, with additional logic to organize the color map. Under Windows on the IBM PC these converted images can then be inserted into C128 \"disk images\" used by C128 emulators and loaded by programs similar to the C128 Basic 7 programs shown above.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'BSAVE', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11367664'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11369828', 'text': 'USS Fair (DE-35)\\n\\nUSS \"Fair\" (DE-35) an Evarts-class destroyer escort of the United States Navy, was a ship named by the United States Navy for Lieutenant, junior grade Victor Norman Fair, Jr., who was born on 15 August 1921 in Lincoln County, North Carolina, enlisted in the Naval Reserve on 15 August 1940, and was commissioned ensign on 14 March 1941.

She put to sea nine days later to conduct an antisubmarine patrol off Tarawa, and late on 4 February, joined to develop a contact previously made by the destroyer. Attacks by both ships led to the sinking of what was probably Japanese submarine I-175 the next morning. \"Fair\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 February, and sailed on 25 February for Majuro, where from 5 March – 12 June, she patrolled the entrance to the lagoon, and escorted ships to and from ocean rendezvous and Roi Namur.

She returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 August for a brief overhaul and to take part in training operations.

Raisins are produced in many regions of the world and may be eaten raw or used in cooking, baking, and brewing. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, the word \"raisin\" is reserved for the dark-colored dried large grape, with \"sultana\" being a golden-colored dried grape, and \"currant\" being a dried small Black Corinth seedless grape.\\n\\nSection::::Etymology.\\nThe word \"raisin\" dates back to Middle English and is a loanword from Old French; in modern French, \"raisin\" means \"grape\", while a dried grape is a \"raisin sec\", or \"dry grape\". The Old French word, in turn, developed from the Latin word \"\", \"a bunch of grapes\".\\n\\nSection::::Varieties.\\nRaisin varieties depend on the type of grape used and are made in a variety of sizes and colors including green, black, brown, blue, purple, and yellow. Seedless varieties include the sultana (the common American type is known as Thompson Seedless in the United States), the Greek currants (black corinthian raisins,\" Vitis vinifera \"L. var. Apyrena) and Flame grapes. Raisins are traditionally sun-dried, but may also be water-dipped and artificially dehydrated.\\n\\n\"Golden raisins\" are generally dried in dehydrators with controlled temperature and humidity, which allows them to retain a lighter color and more moisture. They are often treated with sulfur dioxide after drying.\\n\\nBlack Corinth or Zante currant are miniature, sometimes seedless raisins that are much darker and have a tart, tangy flavor. They are often called currants. Muscat raisins are large compared to other varieties, and also sweeter.\\n\\nSeveral varieties of raisins produced in Asia are available in the West only at ethnic grocers. Monukka grapes are used for some of these.\\n\\nSection::::Nutrition.\\nRaisins can contain up to 72% sugars by weight, most of which is fructose and glucose – forming sucrose when combined in a single molecule. They also contain about 3% protein and 3.7%–6.8% dietary fiber. Raisins, like prunes and apricots, are also high in certain antioxidants, but have a lower vitamin C content than fresh grapes. Raisins are low in sodium and contain no cholesterol.\\n\\nData presented at the American College of Cardiology\\'s 61st Annual Scientific Session in 2012 suggest that, among individuals with mild increases in blood pressure, the routine consumption of raisins (three times a day) may significantly lower blood pressure, especially when compared to eating other common snacks.\\n\\nSection::::Toxicity in pets.\\nRaisins can cause renal failure in dogs. The cause of this is not known.\\n\\nSection::::Sugars.\\nRaisins are sweet due to their high concentration of sugars (about 30% fructose and 28% glucose by weight). The sugars can crystallise inside the fruit when stored after a long period, making the dry raisins gritty, but that does not affect their usability. These sugar grains can be dissolved by blanching the fruit in hot water or other liquids.\\n\\nSection::::Raisin production.\\nGlobal production in 2016 was 1.2 million metric tons, with the US as the top producer contributing 24% of the global harvest.\\n\\nRaisins are produced commercially by drying harvested grape berries. For a grape berry to dry, water inside the grape must be removed completely from the interior of the cells onto the surface of the grape where the water droplets can evaporate. However, this diffusion process is very difficult because the grape skin contains wax in its cuticle, which prevents the water from passing through. In addition to this, the physical and chemical mechanisms located on the outer layers of the grape are adapted to prevent water loss.\\n\\nThe three steps to commercial raisin production include pre-treatment, drying, and post-drying processes.\\n\\nSection::::Pre-treatment.\\nPre-treatment is a necessary step in raisin production to ensure the increased rate of water removal during the drying process. A faster water removal rate decreases the rate of browning and helps to produce more desirable raisins. The historical method of completing this process was developed in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor areas by using a dry emulsion cold dip made of potassium carbonate and ethyl esters of fatty acids. This dip was shown to increase the rate of water loss by two- to three-fold.\\n\\nRecently, new methods have been developed such as exposing the grapes to oil emulsions or dilute alkaline solutions. These methods can encourage water transfer to the outer surface of grapes which helps to increase the efficiency of the drying process.\\n\\nSection::::Drying.\\nThe three types of drying methods are: sun drying, shade drying, and mechanical drying. Sun drying is an inexpensive process; however, environmental contamination, insect infections, and microbial deterioration can occur and the resulting raisins are often of low quality. Additionally, sun drying is a very slow process and may not produce the most desirable raisins.\\n\\nMechanical drying can be done in a safer and more controlled environment where rapid drying is guaranteed. One type of mechanical drying is to use microwave heating. Water molecules in the grapes absorb microwave energy resulting in rapid evaporation. Microwave heating often produces puffy raisins.\\n\\nSection::::Post-drying processes.\\nAfter the drying process is complete, raisins are sent to processing plants where they are cleaned with water to remove any foreign objects that may have become embedded during the drying process. Stems and off-grade raisins are also removed. The washing process may cause rehydration, so another drying step is completed after washing to ensure that the added moisture has been removed.\\n\\nAll steps in the production of raisins are very important in determining the quality of raisins. Sometimes, sulfur dioxide is applied to raisins after the pre treatment step and before drying to decrease the rate of browning caused by the reaction between polyphenol oxidase and phenolic compounds. Sulfur dioxide also helps to preserve flavor and prevent the loss of certain vitamins during the drying process.\\n\\nSection::::Nutrition and health.\\nRaisins are rich in dietary fiber, carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, and minerals like copper and iron, with a low fat content. Raisins are often recommended as a snack for weight control because they help the control of glucose, the good functioning of the digestive system and the regulation of blood pressure.\\n\\nReplacing unhealthy snacks with raisins as a dietary habit has shown positive benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, including reduced diastolic blood pressure and increased levels of plasma antioxidants.\\n\\nCorinthian raisins are a moderate glycemic index fruit that can be consumed in small amounts even by diabetic patients instead of sweets.\\n\\nAntioxidants in Greek raisins may reduce the risk for malignancies in the stomach and colon.\\n\\nRaisins have one of the highest concentrations of boron in dried food, containing between 2 and 3\\xa0mg per 100\\xa0grams. Boron may be important for maintaining healthy bone and joint quality. It has been shown to disadvantage testosterone synthesis. According to a study published in “Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry”, golden raisins have a higher antioxidant capacity than sun-dried black raisins do.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Raisin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113723', 'cat_id': '113723', 'cat_title': \"Drexel_Dragons_men's_basketball_coaches\", 'cat_pages': '16', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ARhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1137561', 'text': 'Esh (letter)\\n\\nEsh (majuscule: Ʃ Unicode U+01A9, minuscule: ʃ Unicode U+0283) is a character used in conjunction with the Latin script.

Pelzer represented Germany at youth level and made 130 appearance in the second Bundesliga. As a 15-year-old Pelzer played as left-back for the German National U15 side that played against England U15's in the Olympiastadion (Berlin) in front of 70,000 people, they won 3-0.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nBorn in Trier, Pelzer began his career with FSV Salmrohr before joining 1. FC Kaiserslautern as a 16-year-old. He played for the U19's for two years before progressing to their reserve side for three years when he was promoted to first team by Otto Rehhagel who coached the club to the Bundesliga title in 1998. In 2002 he moved to England, signing for Blackburn Rovers. He made his debut as a reserve player before making his first team appearance in the Football League Cup against Walsall. However, injuries were to blight his time at Blackburn and he was unable to make it back into the first team.\\n\\nHe returned to Germany after eighteen months at Ewood Park, joining his hometown club, SV Eintracht Trier 05 who were fighting relegation at the time. Pelzer helped the club back into safety where they finished that season in impressive 11th place. He played here for a season and a half, leaving in 2005 after the club's relegation from the 2. Bundesliga. Despite being linked to A.C. Perugia Calcio, Real Murcia, Hannover 96 and Borussia Mönchengladbach he instead was advised by his agent to make the short journey to 1. FC Saarbrücken, where he played for one season. Despite ambitious plans for promotion with the signing of players such as Mustapha Hadji Saarbrücken suffered relegation, and Pelzer left the club. He then signed for Dynamo Dresden in October 2006, where he became a fans' favourite, and was made captain just two months after signing. The club came close to promotion into the second Bundesliga but faltered late on in the season. Pelzer helped lead the club to success in the Saxony Cup competition of 2007.\\n\\nPelzer left the club in the summer of 2007, with the intention of returning to England following trials with Hull City and Plymouth Argyle. Whilst on trial with Plymouth, manager Ian Holloway indicated he wished to sign the player but Pelzer's agent rejected the terms on the grounds of money, something Pelzer was not aware of at the time. He eventually returned to Dynamo Dresden, after the club had agreed a shirt sponsorship deal, and could afford to sign him. Pelzer was soon made captain again and helped the club qualify for the new third Bundesliga in 2008.\\n\\nHis contract with Dynamo was annulled in January 2009 at his own request. On 12 January 2009 he moved up a league to join Bundesliga 2 side Rot-Weiss Ahlen who had tried to sign the player during the previous summer. On 9 June 2010, he signed a two-year contract with F.C. Hansa Rostock. Pelzer was immediately made captain of the club and was used extensively in the clubs marketing campaign. During the promotion season of 2010-11 Pelzer made 37 league appearances missing just one match through suspension. He also led the club to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Cup in 2011. The club made major changes to the promotion winning side, with Pelzer making just 14 league appearances for season. The new team struggled and were eventually relegated after just one season in Bundesliga 2. Pelzer signed a one-year extension to his contract and was back playing regularly in the first team. In 2013 Pelzer suffered a debilitating injury to his toe. Despite this career threatening injury the club extended his contract by two further years with plans to keep Pelzer at the club after his playing career.\\n\\nIn 2015 Pelzer officially retired from playing due to the injury. He's since become a well-known and popular presence in the media appearing in broadcasts in both his native Germany and in England. Pelzer is fluent in English from his time spent playing there.

The film, which was based on the 1932 novel of the same name by John Wells, stars Ginger Rogers, Norman Foster and George Sidney, and features Robert Benchley, Laura Hope Crews and Guinn Williams.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nMary Carroll (Ginger Rogers) is a young woman from upstate who came to New York City to find a job and a career, but whose money has almost run out. Both she and Jack Bacon (Norman Foster), an aspiring artist who lives in the same Greenwich Village building, are behind on their rent and their landlord, Max Eckbaum (George Sidney), a good-natured soul who nevertheless has expenses to meet, comes up with a solution: Move Mary into Jack\\'s loft and have them share the apartment on a shift basis. They would never see each other or know who the other is, since Jack is out all night and sleeps during the day, and Mary is taking a job selling refrigerators by telephone, which keeps her out all day.\\n\\nHowever, both manage to get a very bad impression of each other after realizing the other is of the opposite sex from articles of clothing lying about. A series of misunderstandings leads to a series of pranks aimed at each other: Jack places a bucket in the shower, and when Mary goes in it falls on her head. Then she places Jack\\'s suit in the shower, so that it gets wet. In retaliation, he saws Mary\\'s bed in half so that it would come apart when she sits on it.\\n\\nThe situation gets complicated when the couple accidentally meet outside their apartment and, not knowing who the other is, begin to fall in love. Matters get worse when Mary\\'s boss, lecherous H. Harrington Hubbell (Robert Benchley), tries to invite her out for dinner, while Jack\\'s would-be \"patron\", a lonely, libidinous, rich older woman, Elise Peabody Willington Smythe (Laura Hope Crews), tries to maintain her monopoly over Jack.\\n\\nWhen Jack accompanies Mary to a company picnic, they slip away from the group together and miss the bus back to town, forcing them to take a taxi. When they arrive at Jack\\'s home, Mary realizes that Jack is her roommate. Trying to allay what he assumes are her suspicions about the arrangement, and unaware Mary is the person with whom he has been sharing the attic loft, Jack strongly denounces his co-tenant to her until the landlord comes and explains all.\\n\\nElise and Hubbell also arrive at the apartment, where Elise tries to bribe Mary, while a protective cabdriver, Fritzie (Guinn Williams), punches Hubbell, mistaking him for Jack. Realizing his mistake, Fritzie then goes to his cab where Jack is pleading with Mary. Fritzie is about to punch Jack when Mary intervenes, and the cab drives off with Jack and Mary kissing in the backseat. Asked if they will get married, the landlord says, \"I arranged it.\"\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nProduction on \"Rafter Romance\" began in mid-June 1933. RKO initially announced that Joel McCrea and Dorothy Jordan would star in the film, and then paired Lew Ayres with Ginger Rogers, before casting Norman Foster as the male lead. Foster and Rogers had been teamed before on \"Young Man of Manhattan\" in 1930, and also made \"Professional Sweetheart\" together later in 1933.\\n\\nFour years after the release of \"Rafter Romance\", producer Merian C. Cooper re-made it as \"Living on Love\", with James Dunn and Whitney Bourne, also for RKO. The plots of other films, including the German film \"Ich bei Tag und du bei Nacht\" (1932), the French film \"A Moi le jour, à toi nuit\" (1932) and the British \"Early to Bed\" (1933) have similarities to \"Rafter Romance\", but are actually based on a completely separate screenplay by Robert Liebmann and János Székely.\\n\\nMerian C.

It was one of two successors to the Passport marque, which had a similar intent.\\n\\nPreceding the Asüna marque, Passport sold a Korean (Daewoo) made badge engineered Opel Kadett E known as the Passport Optima (which hit Canadian shores in 1991) as well as a selection of Isuzu cars and SUVs. General Motors Canada changed its branding strategy in 1988, disbanding Passport (the Optima was rebadged for 1992 as Pontiac LeMans). Isuzu was grouped together with Saab and GM\\'s new, import-fighting Saturn division to form Saturn-Saab-Isuzu dealerships. The Geo marque was introduced in Canada in (model year) 1992, offered at Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac dealers (who had been selling the Geo (rebadged Suzuki) marque\\'s products as Chevrolets from 1987 until the marque\\'s introduction). Sales of Geo vehicles were relatively successful, prompting Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealers to request GM Canada to provide a lineup of similar \"import\" vehicles. Asüna was created to fulfill this demand. Geo has been terminated for 1998 so the Chevrolet Tracker name was back (as in 89-91) until 2004. Small Metro and Firefly until year 2000. \\n\\nThe Pontiac LeMans model name was dropped altogether in favour of trimline designations, selling as Asüna SE in base trim hatchbacks and sedans, and as Asüna GT as a higher trim hatchback for 1993. The Asüna lineup was rounded out by the 1993 Sunfire (Isuzu Impulse and Geo Storm twin) and 92-93 Sunrunner taking the GMC Tracker\\'s place in the Pontiac-Buick-GMC lineup.\\n\\nAsüna sales could not match Geo\\'s, and the Asüna marque was eliminated for 1994. The SE/GT and Sunfire were dropped from the GM Canada lineup and Sunrunner was rebadged as a Pontiac (94-97). Firefly (Geo Metro) was back in the Pontiac family for 1994 to \"built excitment\" in the sub-compact car segment. \\n', 'title': 'Asüna', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1138558'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11388027', 'text': 'Jay Hopler\\n\\nJay Hopler (born 1970) is an American poet.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and education.\\nHopler was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In Week 17, they recorded the biggest road win in their history against the Cincinnati Bengals.\\n\\nThe season was marked by close losses in which touchdowns had been called back due to referee error.\\n\\nSection::::Game summaries.\\nSection::::Preseason.\\nThe Buccaneers moved out of aging Houlihan\\'s Stadium after the 1997 season. With construction crews still putting the finishing touches on brand new Raymond James Stadium, the Buccaneers were forced to play all of their preseason games on the road. The team opened with a win against Pittsburgh in the Hall of Fame Game, then faced Kansas City in Oklahoma, an ordeal which saw the team sit at the airport nearly all night.\\n\\nAfter another road trip to Miami, the travel started taking a toll on the team. A cross-country trip to Oakland was followed four days later by a game at New Orleans.\\n\\nSection::::Week 1: at Minnesota Vikings.\\nComing off their playoff season from 1997, the Buccaneers opened 1998 with high expectations. Still on the road, their first game in the new stadium would have to wait until week 3. Receiver Bert Emanuel went out with a sprained ankle, and Tampa Bay lost 31–7.\\n\\nSection::::Week 2: at Green Bay Packers.\\nJacques Green returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown (only his second-career return attempt) to set a franchise record for longest punt return. However, Green Bay won 23–15.\\n\\nSection::::Week 3: Chicago Bears.\\nAfter five games on the road during the preseason, and the first two regular season games played away, the Buccaneers finally were ready for a home game. The highly anticipated first game at brand new Raymond James Stadium saw the Buccaneers host the Bears. After falling behind 15–0 at halftime, Tampa Bay scored 27 unanswered points to win 27–15. Dave Moore caught a one-handed pass for a 44-yard touchdown in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Warrick Dunn ran for a 44-yard touchdown. Raymond James Stadium was opened with a victory, and the Buccaneers improved to 1–2.\\n\\nSection::::Week 4: at Detroit Lions.\\nOn Monday Night Football, Tampa Bay faced Detroit at the Silverdome. Despite clinging to a 6–3 deficit at halftime, Tampa Bay’s sputtering offense and defensive miscues cost any chance at victory. Barry Sanders rushed for 131 yards, Bryant Westbrook returned an interception 34 yards for a touchdown, and Terry Fair returned a Lions record 105-yard kickoff return touchdown. Two apparent touchdown passes by Trent Dilfer were called back for penalty, and Tampa Bay fell 27–6.\\n\\nSection::::Week 5: New York Giants.\\nOnly a minute and a half into the game, Charles Mincy intercepted Kanell for a 22-yard touchdown return. Tampa Bay would never trail in the game. The Buccaneer defense held the Giants to only 135 total yards, and picked off Kanell three times in the 20–3 victory.\\n\\nSection::::Week 7: Carolina Panthers.\\nTampa Bay evened their record to 3–3 with a win over Carolina. The Panthers led 13–3 in the fourth quarter, but Trent Dilfer led the Buccaneers for a rally in the final 5 minutes. On a roll out, Dilfer ran in for a 1-yard touchdown, then on the next possession, scored the go-ahead touchdown. Karl Williams caught a 29-yard touchdown pass in the corner of the endzone with 1:39 to go to seal the victory 16–13.\\n\\nThe Buccaneers improved to 3–0 at Raymond James Stadium.\\n\\nSection::::Week 8: at New Orleans Saints.\\nThe Tampa Bay offense dropped seven passes, Patrick Hape lost a fumble at the Saints 3-yard line, and Trent Dilfer threw an interception, as offensive futility again plagued the Buccaneers, resulting in a 9–3 loss at New Orleans. Three times the Buccaneers had the ball inside the Saints 25-yard line, but came up with zero points. At one point, Bert Emanuel caught a touchdown pass, but the officials ruled it incomplete, saying he \"trapped\" the ball against the turf.\\n\\nSection::::Week 9: Minnesota Vikings.\\nThe Vikings entered week 9 at Tampa Bay undefeated at 7–0. Derrick Brooks intercepted Randal Cunningham, setting up Warrick Dunn\\'s first touchdown run. A back and forth game saw the score tied 17–17 at halftime. Minnesota took a 24–17 lead in the third quarter, but Tampa Bay came back in the fourth. A field goal followed by a Mike Alstott touchdown run with just under six minutes remaining gave the Bucs a 27–24 lead. The Buccaneers had two rushers over 100 yards: Alstott (128) and Dunn (115), with Alstott sealing the game late with a rush of 38 yards.\\n\\nTampa Bay defeated Minnesota 27–24, the Vikings’ first loss and only one during the regular season. The Bucs remained at 0.500, improving to 4–4, and were now 4–0 at Raymond James Stadium.\\n\\nSection::::Week 10: Tennessee Oilers.\\nTampa Bay held a 16-3 halftime lead, but trailing 24–22 at the two-minute warning, Tennessee was facing 3rd down & 8 at their own 29-yard line. A defensive stop by Tampa Bay would have given them the ball back, and an opportunity to drive for a game-winning field goal. However, quarterback Steve McNair broke out for a game-icing 71-yard touchdown run, and the Tennessee Oilers won 31–22.\\n\\nSection::::Week 11: at Jacksonville Jaguars.\\nTampa Bay was leading 24–23 with three minutes remaining. Fred Taylor broke out for a 70-yard touchdown run with 2:40 left, and Jacksonville won 29–24.\\n\\nSection::::Week 12: Detroit Lions.\\nTampa Bay trailed 21–7, but rallied late. With just over two minutes remaining, Trent Dilfer drove the Buccaneers to the Detroit 11-yard line. He was intercepted in the endzone, and Detroit held on to win 28–25. It was Tampa Bay\\'s third straight loss.\\n\\nSection::::Week 13: at Chicago Bears.\\nTampa Bay got back to their winning ways, winning their first road game of the season at Chicago. Late in the second quarter, the Buccaneers blocked a Bears punt, and Ronde Barber scooped it up. He returned the ball 21 yards for a touchdown. As time expired in the first half, Trent Dilfer threw up a Hail Mary touchdown, which was caught by Brice Hunter, his first career NFL touchdown. The Bucs took a 21–14 lead into halftime, and won the game 31–17.\\n\\nTampa Bay\\'s record was now 5–7, still alive for the wild card hunt.\\n\\nSection::::Week 14: Green Bay Packers.\\nTampa Bay hosted Green Bay in their first Monday Night Football home game since 1982. The Buccaneers forced 8 fumbles, and sacked Brett Favre 8 times. Late in the first quarter, Trent Dilfer connected to Jacquez Green for a 64-yard touchdown pass. Minutes later, at the beginning of the second quarter, Dilfer passed to Bert Emanuel in a nearly identical 62-yard touchdown pass. Leading 17–15 in the fourth quarter, Dilfer scrambled through the middle of the Packers defensive line to score a 6-yard touchdown, and a 24–15 lead. Green bay would trim the deficit to 24–22, but the Buccaneers held on to win.\\n\\nTampa Bay improved to 6–7 on the season.\\n\\nSection::::Week 15: Pittsburgh Steelers.\\nTampa Bay won their third game in a row, shutting down the Steelers to just 168 yard of offense. The Tampa Bay defense intercepted Kordell Stewart three times, and Mike Tomczak once. Mike Alstott ran for 78 yards on a wet and rainy day. The Steelers only points came early in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nTampa Bay won 16–3 and evened their record at 7–7. They were now back in the hunt for the wild card.\\n\\nSection::::Week 16: at Washington Redskins.\\nTampa Bay\\'s playoff chances were dealt a big blow in the Week 16 loss at Washington. Tampa Bay led the Redskins 16–7 early in the fourth quarter, but blew the lead at the end. Leading 16–13 with six minutes to go, Jacquez Green fumbled a kickoff, turning the ball over. On the next play, Stephen Alexander caught the game-winning touchdown for Washington. Tampa Bay had two last chances to come back, but both times, Trent Dilfer threw interceptions.\\n\\nThe Buccaneers fell to 7–8 on the season, and would need to win in week 17 to keep their playoff hopes alive.\\n\\nSection::::Week 17: at Cincinnati Bengals.\\nTampa Bay clobbered Cincinnati 35–0, a franchise best for a road shutout. Mike Alstott scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Bucs defense intercepted the Bengals twice (including a 56-yard return by Ronde Barber)\\n\\nTampa Bay finished 8–8 on the season, winning four out of their last five games, and the end of the game, were still alive for an NFC wild card spot. Tampa Bay needed the Giants to beat the Eagles and the Chargers to beat the Cardinals . The Giants won, helping Tampa Bay, but the Cardinals beat the Chargers 16–13 with a 52-yard field goal as time expired. By the time the Buccaneers\\' plane had landed back in Tampa, they were ousted from the playoffs.\\n', 'title': '1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11389733'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1139093', 'text': '1987 Formula One World Championship\\n\\nThe 1987 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 41st season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1987 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1987 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 12 April and ended on 15 November. The World Championship for Drivers was won by Nelson Piquet, and the World Championship for Constructors by Williams-Honda. The season also encompassed the Jim Clark Trophy and the Colin Chapman Trophy, which were respectively contested by drivers and constructors of Formula One cars powered by naturally aspirated engines.\\n\\nSection::::Season summary.\\nAt first, the 1987 championship was a four-way battle between Williams drivers Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell, Lotus driver Ayrton Senna, and McLaren driver and defending two-time champion Alain Prost. Eventually, it became a straight fight between Piquet and Mansell, who between them finished with nine wins from the season\\'s sixteen races. Mansell took six wins to Piquet\\'s three; however, he only recorded three other points finishes while Piquet recorded nine (including seven second places). The duel was settled in Piquet\\'s favour at the penultimate race of the season in Japan, when Mansell crashed heavily in practice and injured his back, ending his season and handing Piquet his third Drivers\\' Championship.\\n\\nSenna finished third having won at Monaco and Detroit; the latter was the 79th and final win for the original Team Lotus. Prost finished fourth despite winning three races; his victory in Portugal took him past Jackie Stewart\\'s record of 27 Grand Prix victories. Ferrari\\'s Gerhard Berger won the final two races of the season, in Japan and Australia, to finish fifth.\\n\\nThe Constructors\\' Championship was comfortably won by Williams, with McLaren second, Lotus third and Ferrari fourth.\\n\\nFor 1987 only, there were two other championships, contested by drivers and constructors of cars powered by naturally aspirated engines: the Jim Clark Trophy for drivers, and the Colin Chapman Trophy for constructors. These championships encouraged teams to switch to such engines, ahead of the ban on turbos from onwards. Tyrrell were the only team to run two \"atmo\" cars for the entire season and thus easily won the Colin Chapman Trophy, while their drivers Jonathan Palmer and Philippe Streiff came first and second respectively in the Jim Clark Trophy.\\n\\nWith the return of the naturally aspirated engines, and the aforementioned turbo ban in mind, the FIA introduced new rules for 1987 in an effort to reduce costs and slow down the cars with a resultant increase in safety, as well as to increase competitiveness between the two engine types. Turbo-powered cars now had to feature a pop-off valve which restricted boost to 4.0 bar, thus limiting engine power. However, advances in engine development, aerodynamics, tyres and suspension meant that the leading teams such as Williams, McLaren and Ferrari nonetheless frequently recorded faster times than they had in 1986, when turbo boost was unrestricted. The FIA also banned super-soft (and sticky) qualifying tyres for 1987, thus eliminating the unpopular practice of having to find a clear lap on tyres which were good for two flying laps at best.\\n\\nPirelli\\'s withdrawal from F1 at the end of 1986 meant that Goodyear was the sole tyre supplier for 1987.\\n\\nSection::::Drivers and constructors.\\nThe following drivers and constructors competed in the 1987 season.\\nSection::::Race by race.\\nSection::::Pre-season report.\\nThe dramatic end to the 1986 season in Australia, with Alain Prost winning the World Championship at the last gasp created tension between Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet but the combination was still potent and with the British Mansell and the Brazilian Piquet staying with the team it was still a powerful challenger. McLaren was without John Barnard but had gained the services of Gordon Murray and Neil Oatley and had retained Alain Prost while Keke Rosberg\\'s retirement had opened the way for Swede Stefan Johansson to join the team, having been dropped by Ferrari in favor of Gerhard Berger. Benetton had hired Thierry Boutsen to replace Berger as Teo Fabi\\'s partner and with the Haas Lola team having closed down the team took over the factory Ford turbo engines, which had improved considerably over their rushed development time. Team Lotus changed color with JPS being replaced by Camel and landed a Honda engine deal for drivers Ayrton Senna and Satoru Nakajima. Martin Brundle left Tyrrell to join Christian Danner at Zakspeed while Zakspeed\\'s Jonathan Palmer joined Philippe Streiff at Tyrrell, which had gone back to using Cosworth DFZ engines. The only BMW engines left were the factory supply to Brabham, these being the units which the cylinders angled to create a low profile for the BT55. Derek Warwick left Brabham to join F1 returnee Eddie Cheever at Arrows with rebadged upright BMW engines which were now known as Megatrons. The team also got a new technical director Ross Brawn joining from the Haas Lola team. Riccardo Patrese was joined at Brabham by Andrea de Cesaris while his place alongside Sandro Nannini at Minardi was taken by wealthy Spanish newcomer Adrian Campos. Osella had only one Alfa Romeo-engined car in Brazil for Alex Caffi. Ligier was due to run new Alfa Romeo four-cylinder turbo engines for Rene Arnoux and Piercarlo Ghinzani but things went badly wrong: Arnoux made disparaging remarks about the Italian company\\'s new four-cylinder turbo engine, referring to them as \"used food\". Alfa Romeo had only recently been acquired by FIAT which was not keen on the Alfa name being in F1. As a result, Alfa Romeo cited a clause in the Ligier contract stating that Ligier should not do anything to damage the image of Alfa Romeo and quit the team. The news was disastrous for Ligier and the team had to miss Brazil while modifying its cars to run Megatron engines. With the rules restricting turbo engines more and more and fewer turbo engines available several teams went back to Cosworth power and the FIA decided to introduce a separate competition for the normally-aspirated cars, introducing a Jim Clark Trophy for drivers and a Colin Chapman Trophy for teams. Four teams would be eligible: Tyrrell, AGS, March and the new Larrousse Lola team, which did not appear in Brazil. March had backing from Leyton House and Ivan Capelli driving an uprated Formula 3000 car while AGS had hired Pascal Fabre to drive. The overall entry was down to 23 cars and with Pirelli having withdrawn there was only one tire supplier, Goodyear.\\n\\nSection::::Race 1: Brazil.\\nThe first race in April at the fast, rough and abrasive Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil resulted in a dominant showing from Williams-Honda with Mansell ahead of Piquet. Then came Senna, Fabi, Prost, Boutsen, Berger, Warwick, Alboreto and Johansson.\\n\\nThe March team suffered a setback on race morning when it ran out of engines, and so the field was down to 22. At the start, Piquet took the lead from the fast-starting Senna while Mansell made a bad start and had to fight his way back to third. on lap seven Piquet suddenly went into the pits, his car having picked up paper in its radiators. he rejoined back in 11th position, leaving Senna to lead Mansell although the British driver was soon in the pits as well to have his radiators cleared. He rejoined behind Piquet and the pair then began to climb through the field. Senna pitted because of handling trouble and so Prost went into the lead and when he stopped for new tyres Boutsen briefly led before Piquet went back into the lead before his second stop. Prost then went ahead again and led for the rest of the afternoon, never looking threatened as he did not have a third tire stop while his rivals Senna and Prost did. Mansell\\'s race was disrupted by a puncture while Senna went out with engine failure and so Prost came home to win ahead of Piquet, Johansson, Berger, Boutsen and Mansell.\\n\\nSection::::Race 2: San Marino (Imola, Italy).\\nAfter the season-opening race in Brazil there was a three-week gap during which March finished building the first 871 chassis for Capelli. Osella expanded to two cars with the second being run by a youngster called Gabriele Tarquini, while Brundle had the first of Zakspeed\\'s new 871 chassis. Ligier was back in action with Megatron-engined cars for Rene Arnoux and Piercarlo Ghinzani. In addition there was another new team in the form of Gerard Larrousse\\'s Lola-Ford/Cosworth team which had employed Philippe Alliot.\\n\\nBut come the San Marino Grand Prix held at the fast Autodromo Dino Ferrari in Italy, Nelson Piquet had a huge accident at the flat out Tamburello corner when he suffered a tire failure during qualifying and was forbidden from racing by F1 doctor Sid Watkins. Goodyear decided that in the interests of safety it would fly in new tyres overnight for Saturday qualifying. On Saturday afternoon Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Honda with Nigel Mansell second quickest in his Williams-Honda. The second row featured Teo Fabi (Benetton-Ford) and Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) with the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger together on the third row. The top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson (McLaren), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) and the two Arrows-Megatrons of Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever. Senna led from the start but on the second lap at Tosa, Mansell swept into the lead and began to pull away. On Lap 6 Prost found a way ahead of Senna and then clawed his way up behind Mansell and stayed there. Prost\\'s race ended, however, on Lap 15 when the McLaren suffered an alternator failure. By then Alboreto had got ahead of Senna and so was in second place with Senna third and Patrese fourth. Mansell stopped earlier than planned for new tyres but was still ahead when everyone reemerged from their first stops. Patrese had moved to second with Alboreto and Senna chasing. In the closing laps Patrese dropped back because he had used too much fuel and so Alboreto was second until he lost boost pressure and Senna went ahead again. Mansell took the flag just under half a minute ahead of Senna with Alboreto third. Johansson was fourth, Martin Brundle fifth (scoring Zakspeed\\'s first points) and Satoru Nakajima picking up sixth in his Lotus-Honda.\\n\\nSection::::Race 3: Belgium.\\nThe high-speed circuit tour kept coming, and next was the Belgian Grand Prix at the magnificent and fast Spa-Francorchamps public road circuit near Liege. The field was much as it had been at the San Marino GP a fortnight earlier, although Osella was back to one car again. Nelson Piquet was back in action after his huge crash at Imola while Zakspeed had two 871 chassis for Martin Brundle and Christian Danner, the German having used an older car in the two previous races. Qualifying saw the two Williams-Hondas at the front with Mansell on pole by nearly 1.5 seconds while Ayrton Senna was third in his Lotus-Honda ahead of the two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Thierry Boutsen\\'s Benetton-Ford/Cosworth, Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham-BMW, Teo Fabi\\'s Benetton and Stefan Johansson in the second McLaren. At the start Mansell took the lead and led Senna, Piquet, Alboreto and Prost. At the start of the second lap Philippe Streiff lost control of his Tyrrell at Raidillon and smashed into the barriers, the impact tearing the engine from the car. Jonathan Palmer then arrived on the scene in the second Tyrrell and smashed into the wreck of Streiff\\'s car. The race was stopped but both men were unhurt, although the Tyrrell team\\'s cars were demolished. At race was restarted which was good luck for Berger and home favorite Boutsen who had collided at the Bus Stop chicane. This time Senna took the lead from Mansell although halfway around the first lap Nigel tried to overtake and the two cars collided and both spun. Senna was out but Mansell was able to get going again. This put Piquet into the lead and Mansell at the back. He would continue until damage from the incident caused him to stop on lap 17, and after he retired, he marched to the Lotus pits to confront Senna, resulting Mansell grabbing Senna by the throat and then the two drivers got into a fist fight. Both had to be separated Second place belonged to Alboreto with Prost third, Boutsen fourth and Fabi fifth after Berger went out with an engine failure. Piquet went out with an engine failure after 10 laps and with Alboreto stopping with a broken CV joint, Prost went into the lead with Boutsen second and Johansson third, the Swede having overtaken Fabi. Stefan then closed on Boutsen and moved to second on lap 17. The pits stops changed little but in the latter part of the race Boutsen fell behind a charged-up Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham-BMW). Boutsen finally retired with a broken CV joint which left fourth place to Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron) with Satoru Nakajima\\'s Lotus-Honda and Rene Arnoux sixth in the Ligier-Megatron.\\n\\nSection::::Race 4: Monaco.\\nThere we no changes in the entry after the Belgian GP and so it was business as usual at Monaco where the three leading Honda-engined cars were at the front as usual with Nigel Mansell taking pole in his Williams, Ayrton Senna second in the Lotus and Nelson Piquet third in the second Williams. Alain Prost was fourth for the McLaren-TAG team with Michele Alboreto fifth in his Ferrari. Sixth place was a surprise in the form of Eddie Cheever\\'s Arrows-Megatron while the top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson (McLaren-TAG), Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford) and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW). Alboreto had a spectacular crash when he ran into the back of Christian Danner\\'s Zakspeed on the climb after Ste Devote. The Ferrari flew through the air but fortunately landed back on the track. With 26 cars starting at Monaco for the first time there were worries about safety in the race. At the start Mansell went straight into the lead so there was no chance of a repetition of his collision with Senna at Spa. The Brazilian was second with Piquet third ahead of Alboreto, Prost and Cheever. The order at the front remained unchanged until Lap 30 when Mansell slowed with a loss of boost pressure. Senna went into the lead and stayed there all the way to the flag, despite stopping for tyres. Piquet stayed second while Prost moved to third, overhauling Cheever who ran third for much of the mid-race. In the closing laps Prost suffered an engine failure and so third place went to Alboreto with Berger fourth (after Cheever went out with engine failure), Jonathan Palmer fifth in his Tyrrell and Ivan Capelli sixth in the Leyton House March.\\n\\nSection::::Race 5: Detroit (USA).\\nThe Canadian Grand Prix had been cancelled due to a dispute over local sponsors Molson and Labatt\\'s; so Detroit was the only North American round in the middle of the European season. This race, on the slowest circuit of the season was generally considered to the toughest and most demanding race of the season, due to the tight and extremely bumpy downtown Detroit city streets lined with concrete walls. The entry was unchanged from the field that had raced at Monaco three weeks earlier and as usual the battle for pole position was between the Honda-powered cars with Nigel Mansell fastest on this occasion with his Williams. Just behind him was Ayrton Senna\\'s Lotus and Nelson Piquet\\'s Williams. There was then a big gap back to Thierry Boutsen\\'s Benetton-Ford, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG, Eddie Cheever\\'s Arrows-Megatron and Michele Alboreto\\'s Ferrari. The top 10 was completed by Teo Fabi (Benetton), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) and Derek Warwick in the second Arrows. Mansell took the lead at the start and began to pull away from Senna while behind in the midfield Stefan Johansson (McLaren) damaged a front wing on the back of Warwick\\'s Arrows and Satoru Nakajima (Lotus-Honda) crashed into the back of Ivan Capelli\\'s Leyton House March and then managed to collide with Adrian Campos\\'s Minardi at the next corner. Behind the two front-runners Piquet had trouble keeping Cheever behind him and eventually gave himself a puncture when he tapped a wheel and had to pit for new tyres. Cheever then had to fight to hold off Fabi and on lap seven the Benetton driver tried to pass and made a mess of it and ended up removing the nose of his car. Both drivers pitted, Fabi to retire and Cheever for new tyres. He rejoined at the back. This left Alboreto third ahead of Boutsen and Prost and the only change in the next few laps was as Prost moved up ahead of the Benetton. Alboreto went out with gearbox failure and so Prost was third as the pit stops approached. During the stops Mansell had a wheel nut stick on his car and lost 10 seconds and that meant that Senna went into the lead with Mansell second, Prost third and Piquet, who had charged up through the field in fourth. Nelson continued his charge and overtook Prost and closed on Mansell, who was suffering from leg cramps. He eventually fell behind the Brazilian, Prost and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari). Senna won at his ease with Piquet second and Prost third. The remaining points went to Berger, Mansell and the recovering Cheever.\\n\\nSection::::Race 6: France.\\nAt the French Grand Prix held at the Paul Ricard circuit near the French Riviera city of Le Castellet, the battle of the Honda powered cars was interrupted in France by a good performance from Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG which qualified second to Nigel Mansell\\'s Williams. The second row featured Ayrton Senna\\'s Lotus-Honda and Nelson Piquet in the second Williams while fifth place went to Thierry Boutsen (Benetton) with Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) following the first four rows. The top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren and Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron. Mansell made a good start to lead Prost into the first corner but on the back straight Piquet blasted ahead of the McLaren to make it a Williams 1–2 with Prost third and Senna fourth ahead of the two Benettons, Boutsen ahead of Fabi. This order did not change although Mansell ran into trouble when he ran over debris from Johansson who had had an accident with Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham) at the first corner. On lap 19 Piquet had a moment and lost second place to Prost but during the pits stops the Brazilian managed to get ahead of both Prost and Mansell. Mansell quickly retook second from Prost and closed up on Piquet but overtaking was another issue until Piquet made a mistake and ran wide on lap 46 and Mansell went ahead. At the second round of stops Piquet stalled in the pitlane and lost just under 10 secs and so Mansell was able to win. Nelson finished second while Prost and Senna were third and fourth ahead of Fabi with the final point going to Philippe Streiff in the Tyrrell-Ford/Cosworth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 7: Britain.\\nThe Mansell-Piquet inter team battle continued at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone with victory in qualifying going to Nelson Piquet who beat his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell to pole by less than a tenth of a second. Third was Ayrton Senna in his Lotus while Alain Prost was fourth fastest in his McLaren-TAG. The third row of the grid was shared by the two Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi while row four was an all-Ferrari affair with Michele Alboreto just ahead of Gerhard Berger. The top 10 was completed by Andrea de Cesaris\\'s Brabham-BMW and the second McLaren driven by Stefan Johansson. There was disappointment for Ligier with Piercarlo Ghinzani being excluded from the meeting after he ran out of fuel on the circuit and was then refueled and push-started by his mechanics. The Italian also did a couple of extra laps at the end of the first qualifying and the catalogue of rule-breaking proved to be too much for the stewards to accept. The Silverstone circuit, which was originally the fastest circuit on the calendar had been modified: the Woodcote chicane had been taken out and replaced with a slower chicane further down the Bridge straight. In what was to be a classic race Prost made a better start than both Williams drivers and took the lead but at the second corner Piquet blasted ahead of the Frenchman and almost immediately Mansell followed Piquet through. It was going to be a straight fight between the two of them. The pace of the Williams drivers and the superiority of the Williams FW11B on high-speed tracks meant that Mansell and Piquet lapped the entire field near the end of the race. Piquet had led for most of the afternoon but in the closing laps, with the crowd roaring him on and having a fresher set of tires (Piquet had decided to go the entire distance on one set), Mansell closed up on Piquet and at Stowe Corner on lap 63 of 65 Mansell went ahead of his rival with a stunning passing maneuver. The pace of the two Williams cars was so furious that they lapped the entire field on a dry circuit. On the slowing down lap Mansell ran out of fuel, and the Honda engine in his car blew up. Third place went to Senna with fourth going to Satoru Nakajima in the second Lotus-Honda and the remaining points going to Derek Warwick (Arrows-Megatron/BMW) and Fabi.\\n\\nSection::::Race 8: Germany.\\nGoing into the German Grand Prix at the very fast Hockenheimring with its forested straights, the World Championship was finely balanced at the midseason with Nelson Piquet leading on 39 points, Ayrton Senna second with 35, Nigel Mansell third with 30 and Alain Prost fourth with 26. Qualifying resulted in Mansell beating Senna to pole with Prost third, edging Piquet to fourth. Michele Alboreto was fifth fastest in his Ferrari with Thierry Boutsen sixth for Benetton. The top 10 was completed by Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham-BMW), Stefan Johansson (McLaren), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari). At the start Senna took the lead with Mansell slow away but he recovered to be second by the end of the first lap ahead of Prost, Piquet, Boutsen, Alboreto and Johansson. At the start of the second lap Mansell went ahead and it was clear that Senna was holding everyone up behind him. Prost went by later on the second lap and Piquet followed on the third lap. Prost was able to close up to Mansell and on lap seven the Frenchman went ahead. Further back in the field the attrition rate was high but at the front little changed until lap 19 when Prost pitted for tires. When Mansell pitted on lap 23 Prost went ahead again. Mansell hoped to catch the McLaren but his engine failed on lap 25 and so Piquet moved to second place while Senna pitted twice trying to solve a serious handling problem and dropped back, leaving Johansson in third place after Boutsen\\'s Benetton had blown its engine. Prost seemed to have the race won but with four laps to go an alternator belt broke and he was forced to retire. Victory thus went to Piquet with Johansson second, Senna third and stragglers picking up the other points: Philippe Streiff and Jonathan Palmer coming home fourth and fifth in their Tyrrells and Philippe Alliot sixth in his Larrousse Lola. The only other man running was Martin Brundle in his Zakspeed 10 laps behind the winner. The attrition rate was in fact so high in this race that only 6 of 26 starting cars finished – the lowest number since the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix. Most of the failures in this race were engine- or turbo-related; the 1.5L turbo-charged cars were producing around 950\\xa0hp in race trim.\\n\\nSection::::Race 9: Hungary.\\nThe big news at the Hungarian Grand Prix at the Hungaroring near Budapest was that Ayrton Senna had informed Lotus that he would not be staying with the team in 1988. Team boss Peter Warr moved quickly and signed Nelson Piquet, who was unhappy that Frank Williams would not give him clear number one status at Williams. Senna was going to join Alain Prost at McLaren. Qualifying for the race in Budapest saw Ferrari making a step forward as Gerhard Berger qualified second behind Nigel Mansell\\'s Williams-Honda. Nelson Piquet was third with Alain Prost fourth in his McLaren while Michele Alboreto was fifth in the second Ferrari and Senna sixth. The top ten was completed by Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren, Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron/BMW and Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham-BMW. Mansell took the lead at the start with Berger making a slightly hesitant start which allowed Piquet to take second before Berger retook the place with a brave outside overtaking maneuver at the first corner. Piquet then lost third place to Alboreto and so it was Mansell being chased by the two Ferraris, with Piquet fourth ahead of Senna, Prost, Boutsen and Johansson. Berger\\'s race would be short-lived as he retired after 13 laps with differential failure. This moved Alboreto to second and Piquet to third and the order stayed the same until Piquet overtook Alboreto on lap 29. Senna was fourth with Boutsen fifth and Prost sixth. The order remained unchanged until lap 44 when Alboreto disappeared with an engine problem and then in the closing laps Prost moved ahead of Boutsen. On lap 71 of 76 Mansell\\'s car lost its right rear wheel nut and he was forced to retire, and victory went to Piquet- this was a major blow to Mansell\\'s championship hopes. Senna was second with Prost third ahead of Boutsen, Patrese and Warwick.\\n\\nSection::::Race 10: Austria.\\nNelson Piquet\\'s fortunate win in Hungary gave him a seven-point lead in the World Championship over Ayrton Senna with Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost 11 points behind Senna. At the Austrian Grand Prix, held at the scenic and spectacular Österreichring, the fastest Grand Prix circuit of the year Nigel Mansell was handicapped slightly by the fact that he had had a wisdom tooth removed before practice began and this affected his performance in qualifying, allowing his Williams-Honda teammate Nelson Piquet to take pole position at an incredible average speed of 159\\xa0mph (255\\xa0km/h). Mansell was second with Gerhard Berger third in his Ferrari and Thierry Boutsen fourth in his Benetton-Ford, just ahead of his teammate Teo Fabi. Michele Alboreto was sixth in the second Ferrari ahead of Ayrton Senna\\'s Lotus-Honda, Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham-BMW, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren and Andrea de Cesaris in the second Brabham. Stefan Johansson had a big fright in practice when he found a deer in the middle of the road and hit it at high speed. This destroyed the McLaren\\'s suspension and he crashed heavily, cracking a rib in the ensuing accident.\\n\\nThe safety of the Austrian track was becoming more of an issue and on race day the problems were underlined again. The narrow pit straight – which had caused problems at Grands Prix for years and one that the organizers had failed to widen – became the center topic of the debate of safety. At the start Piquet got away ahead of a fast-starting Fabi but the race was stopped when Martin Brundle\\'s Zakspeed went out of control, hit a barrier and bounced back into the middle for the track. Rene Arnoux (Ligier) and Adrian Campos (Minardi) collided while the two Tyrrells hit one another and Piercarlo Ghinzani\\'s Ligier was also out with a broken suspension.\\n\\nThe grid was reformed and the field tried to get away again. Piquet went into the lead but Mansell had a problem and was crawling away slowly. Berger too slowed suddenly as he tried to pass the Williams and so there was serious congestion behind with the result that Patrese hit Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron). Johansson hit the back of Cheever and Brundle hit the rear of the McLaren. This resulted in Ghinzani braking and being hit by Alex Caffi\\'s Osella and Ivan Capelli (March), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola), Christian Danner (Zakspeed) and Philippe Streiff (Tyrrell) all becoming involved and then Pascal Fabre (AGS) driving over the back of Jonathan Palmer\\'s Tyrrell. The track was blocked again and the race red flagged for a second time.\\n\\nRemarkably most of the field was able to take the third start with only Streiff missing, although Brundle, Caffi, Danner and Fabre all started from the pitlane. Prost\\'s McLaren refused to get away and so he jumped into the spare and joined the queue in the pitlane. At the end of the parade lap Alboreto went into the pits to have his steering wheel fixed and so there were sixth cars starting from pitlane. This time Senna stalled but everyone avoided the Lotus and Piquet took the lead from Boutsen, Berger, Mansell and Fabi. At the tail of the field Senna, Prost and Alboreto were beginning to charge through the backmarkers. Berger disappeared with a turbo failure after only a few laps and Boutsen disappeared on lap 15 with a gear-linkage which had come loose. This left Piquet and Mansell at the front with Fabi third. On lap 21 Mansell took the lead as the two Williams drivers were diving through backmarkers going down the straight leading to the Bosch-Kurve. Once ahead Mansell was able to keep his lead at the pit stops and Fabi remained third so attention turned to the battles further down the field as Alboreto and Senna battling it out. The two collided and Senna had to pit for a new front wing. He dropped out of the points but managed to pick up places when Alboreto retired with an exhaust problem and Prost was slowed with a similar failure. This meant that Boutsen was fourth with Senna fifth and Prost sixth.\\n\\nThis would be the last Austrian Grand Prix for 10 years; the race would return to the same shortened venue in 1997.\\n\\nSection::::Race 11: Italy.\\nThe field was expanded at the Monza Autodrome near Milan by the arrival of the new Coloni team, fielding Nicola Larini. The Osella team expanded to two cars with the Swiss Franco Forini joining Alex Caffi. Honda had announced that it would not be supplying Williams with engines in 1988, despite the fact the Japanese company still had one year to go on its contract. Honda had decided that it wanted to be with McLaren. This led to questions over whether Honda would treat the two Williams drivers fairly in the battle for the World Championship as Nelson Piquet would be a Honda driver in 1988 and Mansell would not. The Honda men said that it made no difference but few believed them. The Williams team had its new active-suspension system ready and Nelson Piquet used it, while Nigel Mansell stayed with a conventional car. Piquet took pole position with Mansell a tenth behind him but Ayrton Senna was beaten the third place by Gerhard Berger\\'s Ferrari. Then came Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG, Michele Alboreto\\'s Ferrari and Teo Fabi\\'s Benetton. The top 10 was completed by the two Brabhams of Andrea de Cesaris and Riccardo Patrese. At the start of the race Mansell made a good start but then missed a gearchange and so Piquet went into the lead at the first corner with Berger third ahead of Boutsen, Prost and Senna. At the start of the second lap Berger challenged for second place and Mansell closed the door so the two cars collided and Boutsen moved to second place with Berger third and Mansell fourth. The order then remained the same until Mansell was finally able to pass Berger on lap 17. he then overtook Boutsen as well. The mid-race pit stops put Senna into the lead and it looked as though he might be able to go without a pit stop as he had done in Monaco and Detroit. The two Williams-Hondas were second and third with Boutsen behind them. Senna looked fine until lap 43 when he was lapping Piercarlo Ghinzani\\'s Ligier and went off across a sand trap at the Parabolica. By the time he was back on the track Piquet was in the lead. Senna tried to regain the place but his tires would not allow him to challenge and so they finished with Piquet winning the race. Mansell was third with Berger fourth, Boutsen fifth and Stefan Johansson (McLaren) sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 12: Portugal.\\nAt the Estoril Autodrome near the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, the Coloni team did not reappear in Portugal but Osella continued to run a second car for Franco Forini. Ferrari\\'s progress throughout the summer months was confirmed with Gerhard Berger taking pole position ahead of Nigel Mansell\\'s Williams-Honda, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren and Nelson Piquet\\'s Williams. Ayrton Senna was fifth in his Lotus-Honda and the top 10 was completed by Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari, Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham, Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren and the two Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi. At the start Mansell took the lead from Berger but behind them Alboreto collided with Piquet. Derek Warwick spun his Arrows to avoid them and then Satoru Nakajima (Lotus) collided with Martin Brundle (Zakspeed) and the rest of the field piled into the wrecks. The result was that Adrian Campos (Minardi), Christian Danner (Zakspeed), Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola) and Eddie Cheever (Arrows) were also involved. The race was stopped, and at the restart everyone was able to start apart from Danner and Mansell went into the lead again. At the end of the first lap, however, Berger took the lead and with Senna fighting off Piquet for third place the race began to settle down. It took Piquet until the eleventh lap to overtake Senna. Mansell pressured Berger early on but then dropped away as his engine began to misfire and on lap 14 stopped on the circuit. Senna slowed and went into the pits with an electronic problem while Alboreto closed up on Piquet and began to make life difficult for the Brazilian. He eventually got ahead but Piquet soon retaliated. The mid-race pitstops elevated Prost to second place ahead of Piquet and Fabi, while Alboreto disappeared with a transmission failure. The order remained unchanged until the closing laps as Prost gradually closed on Berger and put the Austrian under pressure. On lap 68 of 70 Berger crumbled under the pressure and spun. Prost was in the lead and duly won his 28th victory, to beat Jackie Stewart\\'s long-established record of 27 Grand Prix victories, a record he held until Michael Schumacher surpassed with 52 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. A disappointed Berger was second with Piquet third, Fabi fourth, Johansson fifth and Cheever sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 13: Spain.\\nThe Spanish Grand Prix had been moved to being the final Grand Prix in Europe of the year, and at the Jerez circuit near Seville in southern Spain, the Coloni team was back in action and with Franco Forini staying on for a third event with the Osella team the field was up to 28 cars. The battle for pole position was between the two Williams-Honda with World Championship leader Nelson Piquet (in an active Williams) on pole ahead of challenger Nigel Mansell (who chose to use the passive car). The two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto were third and fourth with Ayrton Senna fifth in his Lotus-Honda. Teo Fabi was sixth in his Benetton-Ford with Alain Prost (McLaren), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton) and the two Brabhams of Riccardo Patrese and Andrea de Cesaris rounding off the top 10. In the race Piquet took the lead but Mansell dived ahead at the end of the first lap and began to pull away from the Brazilian. Senna was third with the two Ferraris and Boutsen chasing. The top five did not change for the first half of the race with Senna at the front of a train of cars. At the pitstops Mansell was away and gone before Senna arrived but Piquet was slower and found himself stuck in fourth place behind Senna and Prost. He challenged Prost but got it wrong and spun back to sixth place. Senna had decided to go through without a stop and those behind him were left to battle with one another while Mansell drove on to victory. Senna\\'s gamble did not pay off because his tires deteriorated quickly and eventually Piquet, Boutsen and Prost were all able to get ahead. Senna then dropped back behind Johansson as well. Piquet then made a mistake and ran wide but Boutsen also made a mistake and spun and so Prost was second with Johansson third, Piquet fourth, Senna fifth and Philippe Alliot sixth in his Larrousse Lola.\\n\\nSection::::Race 14: Mexico.\\nThe Formula One circus moved from one Hispanophonic country to another; this time to Mexico 3 weeks after the Spanish round. This race, held at the high-altitude and very bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome located within a recreational public park in the middle of Mexico City was the 450th Formula One Grand Prix, and the field was much as it had been all season, the only changes being that Osella had gone back to one car and Larrousse has expanded to two with Yannick Dalmas joining Philippe Alliot. Nelson Piquet was 18 points ahead with three races to go and so Nigel Mansell needed a good result without Piquet scoring too well. The atmosphere in the Williams had deteriorated badly between the two drivers to the point where team boss Frank Williams had admitted that he could not do anything to make things better but as Ayrton Senna was out of the running for the World Championship there was no chance that the two could take points from one another as they had in 1986 and let a third driver win the title. In qualifying the drivers found that thanks to the geologically active land the Mexico City track, already made challenging by the humid heat, dust and smog had become more bumpy than last year and there were a series of big accidents, including one of Mansell, and another for Ayrton Senna. The drivers were all complaining intensely about the track surface to FIA personnel, but not much could be done at this point. Mansell was on pole from Gerhard Berger second in his Ferrari ahead of Piquet, Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Alain Prost (McLaren), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Senna. The top 10 was rounded off by Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) and Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham). This Grand Prix was a very unusual race, and at the start Mansell made a bad start and was overtaken by Berger, Boutsen, Piquet and Prost. At the first corner Piquet and Prost tangled and both cars spun. Prost was out but Piquet got going again with assistance from the track marshals. Mansell had moved up to third, and there were further incidents down through the field with Stefan Johansson being spinning and being eliminated when he was hit by Christian Danner, and Nakajima crashing into the back of Derek Warwick\\'s Arrows at the end of the main straight. At the front Boutsen took the lead from Berger on the second lap with Mansell a distant third but then the Benetton began to misfire and Berger went back into the lead and Boutsen went out with electronic injection trouble. Berger retired six laps later with engine failure and with Alboreto also having disappeared Ferrari\\'s race was over. Mansell was thus left in the lead with Senna second and Patrese third and Piquet fourth. Then there were red flags after Warwick (Arrows-Megatron) had a huge accident at the final corner when something broke at the back of his car as a result of Nakajima running into him earlier. A new grid was formed up based on the order of the cars before the crash with the race being decided on aggregate. Piquet took the lead at the restart but with Mansell sitting behind him there was no way he could win the race. In the closing laps Senna spun off and so Piquet ended up in second place having done enough to beat Patrese on aggregate. Eddie Cheever was fourth in his Arrows with Fabi fifth and Philippe Alliot sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 15: Japan.\\nFormula 1 returned to Japan for the first time in 10 years and the circus came for the first time to the twisty, very demanding Honda-owned Suzuka track near Nagoya having been at the very fast Fuji Speedway in 1977. An exciting World Championship showdown between Williams-Honda teammates Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell was on the cards, and the Brazilian Piquet was 12 points ahead on points so the British Mansell was the man under pressure and in qualifying he cracked and crashed heavily at the fast Snake sweepers behind the paddock. The accident left Mansell with severe bruising to his backbone, re-triggering an old injury and it was decided that he should not be allowed to race. Having spent Friday night in hospital Mansell flew back to Europe on Saturday evening. Nelson Piquet was World Champion for the third time, his season-long consistency having paid dividends. The entry was much as it had been in Mexico although AGS decided to replace Pascal Fabre with Roberto Moreno. With Piquet having nothing to prove and Mansell out of the way Gerhard Berger took pole position in his Ferrari ahead of Alain Prost\\'s McLaren, Thierry Boutsen\\'s Benetton-Ford and Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari. Then came Piquet and Teo Fabi (Benetton) with the top 10 completed by Ayrton Senna (Lotus), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren and the second Brabham of Andrea de Cesaris. In the race Berger took the lead at the start and was never threatened, winning a dominant victory; this was Ferrari\\'s first victory since the 1985 German Grand Prix. Boutsen chased Berger early on but dropped behind Senna, Piquet and Johansson. Piquet\\'s race ended with an engine failure in the closing laps and so fourth place went to Alboreto with Boutsen fifth and Satoru Nakajima sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 16: Australia.\\nThe last race of the year was at the demanding and punishing Adelaide street circuit in Australia. With Nigel Mansell out of action with injury after the Japanese GP, Williams did a deal with Brabham to use 1988 signing Riccardo Patrese for the final race of 1987 and Brabham took on youngster Stefano Modena as Patrese\\'s replacement. Otherwise the field was as before. Japanese GP winner Gerhard Berger was on pole position in his Ferrari from Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Nelson Piquet\\'s Williams-Honda and the Lotus-Honda of Ayrton Senna. Thierry Boutsen was fifth quickest in his Benetton-Ford ahead of Michele Alboreto\\'s Ferrari, Patrese\\'s Williams, Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren, Teo Fabi\\'s Benetton and Andrea de Cesaris\\'s Brabham. Berger did as he had done in Japan, leading from flag to flag. He was chased initially by Piquet and Senna but the Lotus soon fell behind Prost. After the midrace pit stops Senna moved to second with Alboreto third. The final World Championship points went to Jonathan Palmer (Tyrrell) in fourth place, Yannick Dalmas (Larrousse Lola) in fifth and Roberto Moreno (AGS) in sixth. Senna was then disqualified for a weight infringement in his last race for Lotus.\\n\\nSection::::Results and standings.\\nSection::::World Drivers\\' Championship – final standings.\\nDrivers\\' Championship points were awarded on a 9–6–4–3–2–1 basis to the top six finishers in each round.

Mary wrote the blank verse drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems. Composed in 1820 while the Shelleys were living in Italy, it is often considered a partner to the Shelleys\\' play \"Midas\". \"Proserpine\" was first published in the London periodical \"The Winter\\'s Wreath\" in 1832. Whether the drama was ever intended to be staged is a point of debate among scholars.\\n\\nThe drama is based on Ovid\\'s tale of the abduction of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself was based on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley\\'s version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres\\'s point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women\\'s writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.\\n\\n\"Proserpine\" is part of a female literary tradition which, as feminist literary critic Susan Gubar describes it, has used the story of Ceres and Proserpine to \"re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself\". However, the play has been both neglected and marginalised by critics.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nIn March 1818 the Shelleys moved to Italy, where their two young children, Clara and William, soon died. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy. She recovered to some extent with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.\\n\\nBetween 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a considerable amount of drama, reading many of William Shakespeare\\'s plays, some with Percy. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play \"The Cenci\", and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama \"Prometheus Unbound\". The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate Vittorio Alfieri\\'s play \"Mirra\" (1785), a tragedy about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel \"Mathilda\".\\n\\nMary Shelley\\'s studies were broad during these years. She began to learn Greek in 1820 and read widely. She had also been reading Ovid\\'s \"Metamorphoses\" since at least 1815 and continued to do so in 1820. Her other reading included Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\'s philosophical treatise, \"\" (1762) and his sentimental novel, \"La Nouvelle Héloïse\" (1761), as well as Thomas Day\\'s children\\'s book \"The History of Sandford and Merton\" (1783–89). Critic Marjean Purinton notes that her reading around the time she was composing \"Proserpine\" included \"educational treatises and children\\'s literature, replete with moralisms concerning gendered behaviors\", as well as her mother Mary Wollstonecraft\\'s, \"Thoughts on the Education of Daughters\" (1787) and \"Original Stories from Real Life\" (1788). These latter were part of the conduct book tradition that challenged the gender roles of women.\\n\\nSection::::Composition and publication.\\nMary Shelley composed \"Proserpine\" in 1820, finishing it on 3 April according to her journal. Percy Shelley contributed two lyric poems: \"Arethusa\" and \"Song of Proserpine While Gathering Flowers on the Plain of Enna\". A fragment of the manuscript survives, housed in the Pforzheimer Collection at the New York Public Library, and demonstrates the couple working side-by-side on the project. According to their friend Thomas Medwin, Percy enjoyed the play, sometimes altering the manuscript as he was reading. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour speculates that both \"Midas\" and \"Proserpine\" were written for two young girls Mary Shelley met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe, daughters of friends of the Shelleys in Italy. Their mother was also a former pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley\\'s mother. That same year, Mary Shelley wrote the children\\'s story \"Maurice\" for Laurette.\\n\\nIn 1824 Mary Shelley submitted \"Proserpine\" for publication to \"The Browning Box\", edited by Bryan Walter Procter, but it was rejected. The play was first published in 1832 in the London periodical \"The Winter\\'s Wreath\". She cut one-fifth of the play—about 120 lines—for this version, deleting some of the stories from the first act, including Percy\\'s poem \"Arethusa\", and rewrote individual lines. (She included \"Arethusa\" in her collection of \"Posthumous Poems\" of Percy Shelley in 1824.) Mary Shelley also added an ominous dream to the play, foreshadowing Proserpine\\'s abduction. Her efforts to publish the play in these periodicals and journal entries written during the play\\'s composition suggest that \"Proserpine\" was meant to be children\\'s literature.\\n\\nSection::::Plot summary.\\nAct I begins with Ceres leaving her daughter Proserpine in the protection of two nymphs, Ino and Eunoe, warning them not to wander. Proserpine asks Ino to tell her a story, and she recites the tale of Arethusa. After the story, the group gathers flowers. The two nymphs wander off, seeking ever more flowers, and lose sight of Proserpine. When they return, she is gone. They search for her in vain. Ceres returns, angry and frightened at the loss of her child:\\nAct II begins some time later. Ino laments: \"How all is changed since that unhappy eve! / Ceres forever weeps, seeking her child / And in her rage has struck the land with blight\". Arethusa comes, to tell Ceres that she saw Pluto make off with Proserpine. Ceres appeals to Jove for assistance, and Iris appears, saying that Proserpine\\'s fate is fixed. However, Jove agrees that if Proserpine does not eat the food of the Underworld, she can return. The group leaves to fetch Proserpine, who believes she has not consumed any tainted food, but she is reminded by Ascalaphus, a shade of the Underworld, of some pomegranate seeds that she ate. Ceres, Ino, and Arethusa volunteer to exile themselves to the Underworld, taking their treasures, such as fertility, with them. However, their sacrifice is not permitted. Iris relates Jove\\'s decision regarding Proserpine\\'s fate: \\n\\nCeres promises that only during the time when Proserpine lives with her will the earth be fertile.\\n\\nSection::::Genre.\\n\"Proserpine\" is a verse drama in blank verse by Mary Shelley which includes two lyric poems by Percy Shelley. In the early nineteenth century, lyric poetry was associated with male poets, and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in \"Proserpine\" reflects this trend. Percy\\'s poems help emphasise the mythic nature of Proserpine\\'s story; he continued this transcendental description of Proserpine in his \"Prometheus Unbound\". Mary\\'s drama consists of carefully described objects, such as flowers. Furthermore, her characters do not speak in soliloquy—except in Percy\\'s poems—rather, \"nearly every speech is directed feelingly toward another character and is typically concerned with describing another\\'s emotional state, and/or eliciting an emotional reaction.\" Dialogue in \"Proserpine\" is founded on empathy, not the conflict more typical of drama. Mary Shelley also refused to embrace the visual sensationalism of early nineteenth-century theatre, focusing instead on \"scenes of heightened emotion\".\\n\\nScholars have disputed whether or not Mary Shelley intended her play to be staged. Most concur that it was never meant for performance, agreeing with Romanticist Alan Richardson that the play is \"lyrical drama\" or \"mental theater\" in the style of Romantic closet drama \"with its emphasis on character over plot, on reaction over action, and its turn away from the theater\". However, eighteenth-century theatrical scholar Judith Pascoe challenges this conclusion, pointing to detailed stage directions in the manuscript: \"Ceres and her companions are ranged on one side in eager expectation; from the cave on the other, enter Proserpine, attended by various dark & gloomy shapes bearing torches; among which Ascalaphus. Ceres & Persephone embrace;–her nymphs surround her.\" From this evidence, she argues that Shelley intended her play to be staged.\\n\\nLiterary scholar Jeffrey Cox has argued that \"Proserpine\", along with \"Midas\", \"Prometheus Unbound\" and other plays written by the Leigh Hunt circle, were \"not a rejection of the stage but an attempt to remake it\". Turning from the traditional genres of tragedy and comedy of manners, these writers reinvented drama by writing masques and pastoral dramas. He argues that \"Midas\" and \"Proserpine\" are a pair of mythological dramas that demonstrate \"the forces of oppression\". For him, \"Proserpine\" \"celebrates a pastoral world...threatened by male sexual violence and the tyranny of a sky god\".\\n\\nSection::::Themes.\\nMary Shelley expanded and revised the Roman poet Ovid\\'s story of Proserpine, which is part of his larger \"Metamorphoses\". The tale is based on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, which explains the change of the seasons through Persephone\\'s visits to the Underworld: when she is confined to Hades\\'s realm, autumn and winter cover the earth, and when she returns to live with her mother, spring and summer bloom. The myth depicts the victory of male violence over female procreation. Like Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron, Mary Shelley was interested in rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was particularly interested in challenging their patriarchal themes. In revising the Proserpine myth, she placed women and their power at the centre of the narrative. For example, Ovid represents Proserpine as \"an unreflective child, willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon\" while \"Shelley portrays Proserpine as a thoughtful, empathetic adolescent\" who wants to find flowers for her mother. Ovid\\'s version of the myth focuses on violence, particularly the abduction and rape of Proserpine, while Shelley\\'s play focuses on the suspenseful search for Proserpine. Her version highlights Ceres and the nymphs’ grief and Proserpine\\'s own desire to escape from the Underworld instead of the rape (the rape happens offstage). In contrast, other nineteenth-century adaptations often expanded the rape scene, romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship.\\n\\nWomen and women\\'s issues dominate Mary Shelley\\'s drama—no male characters appear, with the brief exception of Ascalaphus. However, as Romanticist Marjean Purinton argues, there is a strong masculine presence in the play even without male characters, suggesting \"the ubiquitous presence of patriarchal power in the domestic sphere\". Although the myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny, Shelley transforms it into a story about female solidarity and community—these women are storytellers and mythmakers who determine their own fate. Ceres\\'s love—a mother\\'s love—challenges the power of the gods. Shelley tells the story almost entirely from Ceres\\'s point of view; \"her play elegiacally praises female creativity and fecundity as ‘Leaf, and blade, and bud, and blossom.’\\xa0\" Shelley writes active, rather than passive, roles for Proserpine and Ceres. For example, it is Ceres\\'s anger, not her grief, that brings \"winter\\'s blight\". However, Proserpine\\'s abduction is prefigured in the story of Arethusa and, as literary scholar Julie Carlson points out, the women can only join together after Proserpine has been abducted.\\n\\nIn Shelley\\'s version of the myth, paradise is lost not through the fault of women but through the interference of men. Pluto\\'s \"egotistical, predatory violence\" is juxtaposed with Ceres\\'s \"loving kindness, her willingness to sustain life, [and] her unswerving devotion to her child\". Sex, in this myth, is represented as a separation from the feminine and a forced surrender to the masculine. Pluto\\'s domination of Proserpine symbolises \"a culture based on acquisition and brutality, a culture that covertly justifies (when it does not overtly celebrate) male mastery\".\\n\\n\"Proserpine\" and \"Midas\" are often seen as a pair of contrasting plays. \"Proserpine\" is a play of female bonding, while \"Midas\" is a male-dominated drama; male poets participate in a contest in \"Midas\" while in \"Proserpine\" female characters participate in communal storytelling; \"where Midas lives in his golden palace imagining himself at the center of an all-powerful court, Ceres laments leaving the pastoral enclave she shares with Proserpine for Jove\\'s court\"; Midas focuses on gold, while the women in \"Proserpine\" enjoy flowers; and \"where the society of \"Midas\" is marked by egotism, greed, and strife, the female society of \"Proserpine\" values community, gift-giving, and love\".\\n\\nSection::::Legacy and reception.\\nAs feminist literary critic Susan Gubar argues, Mary Shelley\\'s drama is part of a female literary tradition, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, H.D., Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, and Doris Lessing, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a \"way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood...they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself.\" Poets such as Dorothy Wellesley, Rachel Annand Taylor, Babette Deutsch, and Helen Wolfert as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge \"the divisions between self and other\" that rest at the centre of patriarchy. Feminist poet Adrienne Rich writes that \"the loss of the daughter to the mother, the mother to the daughter, is the essential female tragedy\", and it is this tragedy that Mary Shelley discusses in her play.\\n\\nWhen A. Koszul first published a transcription of \"Proserpine\" in 1922, he argued \"that the little classical fancies which Mrs. Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works\". However, his \"Introduction\" to the play speaks mostly of Percy Shelley and his contribution to Mary Shelley\\'s works. In fact, as he explains, he decided to publish to contribute to the Percy Shelley centenary. Since their original publication, neither \"Midas\" nor \"Proserpine\" has received much critical attention. Critics have either paid attention only to Percy Shelley\\'s poems, or have ignored the plays altogether. Literary critic Elizabeth Nitchie writes that the plays are \"distinguished only by the lyrics that [Percy] Shelley wrote for them\", and Sylvia Norman contends that they \"do not really call for analytical and comparative study\". While \"Frankenstein\" has remained a powerful cultural force since its publication, Mary Shelley\\'s other works have rarely been reprinted and scholars have focused almost exclusively on Mary Shelley, author of \"Frankenstein\", and Mary Shelley, wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. However, with the publication of works by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s and \"The Other Mary Shelley\" in 1993, more attention has been paid to Mary Shelley\\'s \"other\" works, such as her dramas.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Proserpine (play)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11418750'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'HRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11420687', 'text': 'James O.

Alongside \"R. oryzae, R. microsporus\" causes the premier head rot of sunflower in South Africa. Susceptibility to disease changes throughout the age of the host. The initial symptoms appear as small, dispersed water-soaked spots on the back of the sunflower head. As the spots expand, mycelial growth expands into parenchyma cells, further killing cells within the head. Later stages of disease have external masses of mycelium among clumps of black sporangia, dispersing spores abiotically, and by birds. The diseased heads can completely rot in 3 to 7 days.\\n\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" has been found to be the species involved in Rhizopus Ear Rot of maize as well. This is characterized by small spotted sporangia structures, mycelium growth on the ear, and eventual ear and grain rot.\\n\\nSection::::Disease cycle.\\nThe life cycle of \"R. microsporus\" is quite similar to the general life cycles of common \"Rhizopus\" species.The primary feature as a plant pathogen is the intake of resources from a plant host. The initial infection occurs from asexual spores overwintered in plant debris. These spores infect the host where susceptibility is best, such as young roots of rice seedlings, or the mature sunflower head. Once infected, the production of hyphae and mycelium continue to spread the infection, creating sporangia as a secondary cycle. The resources gathered are a result of the symbiotic relationship with \"Burkholderia\" species, allowing for rhizoxin production to kill plant cells.\\n\\nA sexual stage is present, in the same fashion as most zygomycetes, with fused hyphae of alternate mating types producing a zygospore.\\n\\nThere is an upcoming theory in \"R. microsporus\" that suggests that a portion of the reproductive cycle is replaced when put in symbiosis with the rhizoxin producing bacteria.\\n\\nSection::::Environment.\\nThis fungus is most commonly found in soil, plant debris, and foodstuffs. It is a pathogen of many crops and therefore is found in many diverse environments. \"R. microsporus\" is generally found in soils with a neutral pH. These soil levels usually have lower salinity for optimum growth conditions. The growth range of \"R. microsporus\" ranges from 25℃ to 55℃ with an optimal temperature of 28℃. Its primary host is rice and it is also commonly found in maize and sunflowers. \"R. microsporus\" causes disease in humans, one of its alternative hosts, causing infections of the lungs. In one rare case it was found tainting hospital linens in Hong Kong leading to a scare that brought the disease into the forefront of mainstream media.\\n\\nSection::::Management.\\nThe management of \"R. microsporus\" can be either complete sterilization, antifungal use, or the blocking of sporulation so it cannot spread. This fungal-bacterial symbiont is classified as a biosafety level 2 organism. A common method of sterilization is getting rid of all of the reproductive structures of the fungus. More difficult sterilizations oftentimes requires control agents such as antifungals are employed. However, \"R. microsporus\" is also naturally resistant to fluconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole and the echinocandins. Antifungal prescription drugs that usually will control \"R. microsporus\" are amphotericin B and triazoles such as posaconazole, it’s also occasionally susceptible to itraconazole. Another way to control this pathogen would be to eliminate its bacterial endosymbiont, without this endosymbiont the fungus is unable to sporulate.\\n\\nThe bacteria has a type III secretion system that allows it to communicate with its fungal host, and without the bacterias\\' secretion system, the fungi could not produce spores. This bacterium is passed on vertically from fungus to fungus through the sporangia while these spores are germinating. Without the bacteria none of the reproductive structures can be created by the fungus.\\n\\nSection::::Importance.\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" causes rice seedling blight and is a severe crop disease in Asia.\\n\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" is also one of very few fungi that harbors bacterial endosymbionts to control its production of toxins. Understanding the evolutionary association between \"R. microsporus\" and \"B. rhizoxinica\" and how the symbiosis is maintained has been an area of interest. In all cases, it is obvious that the fungus profits from the biosynthetic capabilities of the endosymbiont in order to access nutrient sources. Yet, the advantage for the bacterial symbiont is not evident.\\n\\nSporulation does not occur without the presence of both \"B. rhizoxinica\" and R. microsporus. The T3SS involved in this relationship is the first report on a T3SS involved in bacterial–fungal symbiosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the T3SS represents a prototype of a clade of uncharacterized T3SSs within the \"hrp\" superfamily of T3SSs from plant pathogenic microorganisms.\\n\\nSection::::Pathogenesis.\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" lives as a necrotroph where both the fungus (\"Rhizopus microsporus\") and its harbored endobacteria (\"Burkholderia rhizoxinica\") form a symbiotic relationship. In order to kill the living cells of its host, the harbored endobacteria secrete rhizoxin, a toxin that inhibits cell mitosis and vegetative production. \"R. microsporus\" has developed a resistance to the toxin due to an amino acid exchange in the β-tubulin protein. The resulting necrosis of the plant tissue replenishes nutrients to both the fungus and the bacteria by feeding on the decaying matter.\\n\\nThe virulence factor in all known cases are biosynthesized by the pathogenic fungus. In this case of the symbiosis between \"R. microsporus\" and \"B. rhizoxinica\", the hosted bacteria population produces the causative agent of rice seedling blight. Toxin formation by the bacteria has been demonstrated in analogy with Koch\\'s postulates through the discovery that rhizoxin-producing strains of \"R. microsporus\" contained symbionts. Removal of the symbionts from the host degraded rhizoxin production and the symbionts were then grown in pure culture. Lastly, the re-introduction of the bacteria grown in pure culture back into the host reestablished rhizoxin production.\\n\\nThe maintenance of the symbiosis is crucial for sporulation to occur. The endofungal bacteria possess a type III secretion system (T3SS) in order to achieve symbiosis. Mutants defective in the T3SS mechanism show reduced intracellular survival and no sporulation. This T3SS is a pathogenicity factor that is required by the pathogen in order to cause disease.\\n', 'title': 'Rhizopus microsporus', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11420926'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1142319', 'text': 'Greek National Road 6\\n\\nGreek National Road 6 (, abbreviated as EO6) is a national road in north-central Greece.

The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with Kunda culture. The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement, which was located on the banks of the river Pärnu, near the town of Sindi, in southwestern Estonia. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda Culture received its name from the \"Lammasmäe\" settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500. Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern Lithuania and southern Finland. Among minerals flint and quartz was used the most for making cutting tools.\\n\\nSection::::The Neolithic Period.\\nThe beginning of the Neolithic period is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, which appears in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium BC. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.\\n\\nArtifacts identified as belonging to the \"Comb Ceramic Culture\" have been found at sites from Northern Finland to Eastern Prussia. Burials associated with the culture often include figures of animals, birds, snakes and humans carved from bone and amber beginning from the middle of the 4th millennium BC. Until the early 1980s, the scholarly consensus held that the appearance of Comb Ceramic culture artifacts was associated with the arrival of Finnic peoples (ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, and Livonians) on the shores of the Baltic Sea. However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with ethno-linguistic ones is no longer assumed to be a given. An alternative hypothesis is that the increase of settlement finds in the period may have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate. Some researchers have even argued that a Uralic language may have been spoken in Estonia and Finland since the end of the last glaciation.\\n\\nSection::::Late Neolithic - Chalcolithic.\\nThe beginning of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 BC is characterized by the appearance of the Corded Ware culture, pottery with corded decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes). Evidence of agriculture is provided by charred grain of wheat on the wall of a corded-ware vessel found in Iru settlement. Osteological analysis show an attempt was made to domesticate the wild boar.\\n\\nSpecific burial customs were characterized by the dead being laid on their sides with their knees pressed against their breast, one hand under the head. Objects placed into the graves were made of bones of domesticated animals.\\n\\nSection::::The Bronze Age.\\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 BC. The development of the borders between the Finnic peoples and the Balts was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of Saaremaa and Iru in the Northern Estonia began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, stone cist graves and cremation burials became increasingly common aside small number of boat-shaped stone graves.\\n\\nSection::::The Iron Age.\\nThe Pre-Roman Iron Age began in Estonia about 500 BC and lasted until the middle of the 1st century BC. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square Celtic fields surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.\\n\\nThe Roman Iron Age in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the Roman Empire. In material culture this is reflected by few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artifacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas: Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia (including the islands) had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.\\n\\nSection::::Early Middle Ages.\\nThe name of Estonia occurs first in a form of Aestii in the 1st century AD by Tacitus. However, at this stage it probably indicated Baltic tribes living in the area of Western Lithuania and the present-day Kaliningrad. In the Norse sagas (13th century) the term apparently was used to indicate the Estonians.\\n\\nAccording to one interpretation, Ptolemy in his \"Geography III\" in the middle of the 2nd century AD mentions the Osilians among other dwellers on the Baltic shore.\\n\\nThe extent of Estonian territory in early medieval times is disputed but the nature of their religion is not. They were known to the Scandinavians as experts in wind-magic, as were the Lapps (known at the time as Finns) in the North. The name Estonia is first mentioned by Cassiodorus in his book V. Letters 1–2 dating from the 6th century.\\n\\nSaxo Grammaticus describes the Curonians and Estonians as participating in the Battle of Bråvalla on the side of the Swedes against the Danes, who were aided by the Livonians and the Wends of Pomerania. It is notable that other Baltic tribes — i.e., the Letts and Lithuanians — are not mentioned by Saxo as participating in the fight.\\nSnorri Sturluson relates in his \"Ynglinga saga\" how the Swedish king Ingvar (7th century), the son of Östen and a great warrior, who was forced to patrol the shores of his kingdom fighting Estonian pirates. The saga speaks of his invasion of Estonia where he fell in a battle against the men of \"Estland\" who had come down with a great army. After the battle, King Ingvar was buried close to the seashore in Estonia and the Swedes returned home.\\n\\nAccording to Heimskringla sagas, in the year 967 the Norwegian Queen Astrid escaped with her son, in future king of Norway Olaf Tryggvason from her homeland to Novgorod, where her brother Sigurd held an honoured position at the court of Prince Vladimir. On their journey, \"Eistland\" (Oeselian?) Vikings raided the ship, killing some of the crew and taking others into slavery. Six years later, when Sigurd Eirikson traveled to \"Eistland\" to collect taxes on behalf of \"Valdemar\" (Vladimir), he spotted Olaf in a market in an unmentioned city and paid for his freedom.\\n\\nA battle between Oeselian and Icelandic Vikings off Saaremaa is described in Njál\\'s saga as occurring in 972 AD.\\n\\nAbout 1008, Olaf the Holy, later king of Norway, landed on Saaremaa. The Oesilians, taken by surprise, had at first agreed to pay the demands made by Olaf, but then gathered an army during the negotiations and attacked the Norwegians. Olaf (who would have been only 13 years old) claimed to have won the battle. Olaf was the subject of several biographies, both hagiographies and sagas, in the Middle Ages, and many of the historical facts concerning his adventures are disputed.\\n\\nThe Chudes as mentioned in Old East Slavic chronicles are in early context usually considered as Baltic Finns in north-western Rus or even as all non-Slavic people in north-eastern Europe, but since 11th century mainly as Estonians. According to Primary Chronicle the Chudes where one of the founders of the Rus\\' state in 9th century. According to Nestor Yaroslav I the Wise invaded the country of the Chuds in 1030 and laid the foundations of Yuriev, (the historical Russian name of Tartu, Estonia).\\n\\nAccording to the Novgorod Chronicle, Varyag Ulf (Uleb) from Novgorod was crushed in battle at \"Iron Gate\", which is usually located in norther Russia, but according to one hypothesis took place on sea close to the Tallinn Bay in 1032.\\n\\nIn the 1st centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (\"kihelkond\") and the county (\"maakond\"). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).\\n\\nEstonia constitutes one of the richest territories in the Baltic for hoards from the 11th and the 12th centuries. The earliest coin hoards found in Estonia are Arabic Dirhams from the 8th century. The largest Viking Age hoards found in Estonia have been at Maidla and Kose. Out of the 1500 coins published in catalogues, 1000 are Anglo-Saxon.\\nVarbola Stronghold () was one of the largest circular rampart fortress and trading center built in Estonia, Harju County () at the time.\\n\\nIn the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the Vikings from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. \\nWith the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually lead to Baltic crusades.\\nThe east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: First the Livs, Letts and Estonians, then the Prussians and the Finns underwent defeat, baptism, military occupation and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Ancient Estonia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11432901'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'JBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11436789', 'text': 'William E.

The method is a waterfall model divided in seven phases that have a clear start and end. Each phase delivers (sub)products, called milestones. It was used extensively in the Netherlands for ICT projects in the 1980s and 1990s. PANDATA was purchased by the Capgemini group in the 1980s, and the last version of SDM to be published in English was SDM2 (6th edition) in 1991 by CAP GEMINI PUBLISHING BV.

SDM, SDM2, SDM/70, and Spectrum evolved into system development methodologies that were based on the works of Steven Ward, Tom Demarco, Larry Constantine, Ken Orr, Ed Yourdon, Michael A. Jackson and others, as well as data modeling techniques developed by Thomas Bachmann and Peter Chen. SDM is a top-down model. Starting from the system as a whole, its description becomes more detailed as the design progresses. The method was marketed as a proprietary method that all company developers were required to use to ensure quality in customer projects. This method shows several similarities with the proprietary methods of CAP Gemini\\'s most important competitors in 1990. A similar waterfall method that was later used against the company itself in court proceedings in 2002 was CMG:Commander.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSDM was developed in 1970 by a company known as PANDATA, now part of Cap Gemini, which itself was created as a joint venture by three Dutch companies: AKZO, Nationale Nederlanden and PTT. The company was founded in order to develop the method and create training materials to propagate the method. It was successful, but was revised in 1987 to standardize and separate the method theory from the more technical aspects used to implement the method. Those aspects were bundled into the process modelling tool called Software Development Workbench (SDW), that was later sold in 2000 to BWise, another Dutch company. This revised version of the method without the tool is commonly known as SDM2.\\n\\nSection::::Main difference between SDM and SDM2.\\nSDM2 was a revised version of SDM that attempted to solve a basic problem that occurred often in SDM projects; the delivered system failed to meet the customer requirements. Though any number of specific reasons for this could arise, the basic waterfall method used in SDM was a recipe for this problem due to the relatively large amount of time spent by development teams between the Definition Study and the Implementation phases. It was during the design phases that the project often became out of sync with customer requirements.\\n\\nDuring the SDM functional design phase called BD (Basic Design), design aspects were documented (out of phase) in detail for the later technical design DD (Detailed Design). This caused a gray zone of responsibility to occur between the two phases; the functional crew responsible for the data flows and process flows in the BD were making decisions that the technical crew later needed to code, although their technical knowledge wasn\\'t detailed enough to make those decisions. This obviously led to problems in collaboration between project teams during both the BD and DD phases. Because of the waterfall method of Go/No Go decisions at the end of each phase, the technical crew would have to make a formal Change request in order to make corrections in the detailed sections of the Basic Design. Such changes were often confusing for the customer, because these originated from the project team rather than directly from the customer requirements, \"even after a change freeze was put in place\". Usually the customer was only allowed to produce requirements up to and including the functional design in the BD phase. After that, the customer had to wait patiently until acceptance testing in the Implementation phase.\\n\\nIn SDM2, the term \"Basic Design\" was replaced by the term \"Global Design\" to indicate that this document was continuously updated and subject to change during both the BD and DD phases. Thus the \"Basic design\" is both global and detailed at the end of the project. In the global design, the principles of functionality and construction, as well as their relations, are documented. This is how the idea of iterative development got started; a functional design is by nature influenced by the technology platform chosen for implementation, and some basic design decisions will need to be revisited when early assumptions prove later to be wrong or costly to implement. This became the forerunner of the Rapid Application Development method, which caused these two phases to become cyclical and work in tandem.\\n\\nSDM2 only partially solved the problem of meeting customer requirements; modern software development methods go several steps further by insisting for example on incremental deliveries, or that the customer appoint key users of the delivered system to play a role in the project from start to finish.\\n\\nSection::::The SDM method.\\nSDM is a method based on phases. Before every phase, an agreement needs to be reached detailing the activities for that phase. These documents are known as milestone documents. Several uses for these documents exist:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Phases.\\nThe method uses 7 phases which are successively executed, like the waterfall model. The phases are:\\n\\n\\nUpon completion of a phase, it is decided whether to go on to the next phase or not; the terms \\'Go\\' and \\'NO-GO\\' are used for this. The next phase will not start until a \\'Go\\' is given, while if there is a \\'NO-GO\\', the project either stays in the current phase to be improved or is canceled completely.\\n\\nSection::::Information planning (IP).\\nIn this phase, the problems that have to be solved by the project are defined. The current and desired situations are analysed, and goals for the project are decided upon. In this phase, it is important to consider the needs of all parties, such as future users and their management. Often, their expectations clash, causing problems later during development or during use of the system.\\n\\nSection::::Definition study (DS).\\nIn this phase, a more in-depth study of the project is made. The organization is analysed to determine their needs and determine the impact of the system on the organization. The requirements for the system are discussed and decided upon. The feasibility of the project is determined. Aspects that can be considered to determine feasibility are:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Basic Design (BD).\\nIn this phase, the design for the product is made. After the definition study has determined what the system needs to do, the design determines how this will be done. This often results in two documents: The functional design, or User interface design explaining what each part of the system does, and the high-level technical design, explaining how each part of the system is going to work. This phase combines the functional and technical design and only gives a broad design for the whole system. Often, the architecture of the system is described here.\\n\\nSDM2 split this step in two parts, one for the BD phase, and one for the DD phase, in order to create a Global Design document.\\n\\nSection::::Detailed Design (DD).\\nIn this phase, the design for the product is described technically in the jargon needed for software developers (and later, the team responsible for support of the system in the O&S phase). After the basic design has been signed off, the technical detailed design determines how this will be developed with software. This often results in a library of source documentation: The functional design per function, and the technical design per function, explaining how each part of the system is going to work, and how they relate to each other. \\n\\nIn SDM2, this phase elaborates on the Global Design by creating more detailed designs, or further refining existing detailed designs, to the point where they can be used to build the system itself.\\n\\nSection::::Realization (R).\\nIn this phase, the design is converted to a working system. The actual way this is done will depend on the system used. Where in older systems programmers often had to write all of the code, newer systems allow the programmers to convert the design into code directly, leaving less work to be done and a smaller chance for errors. At the same type, the system becomes more reliant on the design—if the design has been properly tested, the proper code will be generated, but if the design is not fully correct, the code will be incorrect without a programmer to look for such problems.\\n\\nSection::::Implementation (I).\\nThe implementation, or testing phase consists of two steps: a system test and an acceptance test.\\n\\nDuring the system test the development team—or a separate testing team—tests the system. Most of this will be focused on the technical aspects: does the system work as it should, or are there bugs still present? Bugs that are found in this phase will be fixed. At the ending of this phase, the program should work properly.\\n\\nDuring the acceptance test, the end-users will test the system. They will test to see if the program does what they want it to do. They will not test every possible scenario, but they will test to see if the program does what they want and expect it to do and that it works in an easy way. Bugs that are found in this phase will be reported to the development team so that they can fix these bugs.\\n\\nDuring this phase, the final version of the system is implemented by the organization: the hardware is set up, the software is installed, end user documentation is created and, end users trained to use the program, existing data is entered into the system.\\n\\nSection::::Operation and Support (O & S).\\nOnce the system has been implemented, it is used within the organization. During its lifetime, it needs to be kept running and possibly enhanced.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Cap Gemini SDM', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11441217'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1144316', 'text': 'MacPherson, Singapore\\n\\nMacPherson is a neighbourhood located in Geylang in the Central Region of Singapore. Its location roughly corresponds to the similarly titled subzone of Macpherson in the Geylang Planning Area and is approximately sandwiched between the neighbourhoods of Aljunied and Paya Lebar. MacPherson largely consists of a small public housing estate centered on Circuit Road and an industrial area. The neighbourhood is served by the Circle MRT Line and Downtown Line at MacPherson MRT Station and Mattar MRT Station.\\n\\nSection::::Etymology.\\nFormerly called \"Jalan Klapa\", MacPherson Road was named after Lieutenant Colonel Ronald MacPherson (1817-1869). \\n\\nMacPherson served in the China War of 1841 and was appointed Staff Officer to the Artillery in the Straits in 1843. He succeeded Colonel H. Man as Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts and Resident Councillor, Malacca in 1855 and 1857 respectively. He had been active in forming a local volunteer corps at the outbreak of the Crimean War and was appointed First Captain Commandment of the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps formed in 1854. When the first Municipal Act came into operation in 1856, he became an ex officio member of the Commission, becoming President on three later occasions. He was appointed the first Colonial Secretary when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867.\\n\\nMacPherson designed the current St Andrew\\'s Cathedral along the lines of Netley Abbey in England and built it in six years using Indian convict labour. Completed in 1862, the cathedral is considered one of the finest specimens of ecclesiastical architecture in the east. On the cathedral grounds, the architect is commemorated in a memorial called the MacPherson Memorial Monument. He was buried in the old Bukit Timah Road Christian Cemetery, which has since been landscaped and made into a park.\\n\\nThe name Macpherson -- or MacPherson or McPherson, according to different spellings -- comes from the Gaelic Mac a\\' phearsain and means \\'Son of the parson\\'.

The town had a population in 2001 of 6,107, increasing to 6,519 at the 2011 Census.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe town was largely a small farming settlement until the industrial revolution and the sinking of collieries caused a boom in population and a need for modern housing for the workforce. This has left a town with a mixture of stone and brick buildings. The town and its neighbours were mentioned in the \"Domesday Book\". Other industries such as quarrying for stone, agriculture and brick manufacture were also known at different periods of the town\\'s history, with many of the former buildings and sites associated with them still existing.\\n\\nSection::::Former quarry site.\\nThe former South Elmsall quarry was deemed a site of national importance, by Defra, due to the visible section of an unusually complete patch coral reef.\\n\\nSection::::Coal mining.\\nThe town is most famous for its coal-mining past; it was the site of Frickley Colliery, which was one of the largest deep coal mines in the United Kingdom. The colliery invested in several improvements that were of benefit to the area, including the building of the Warde Aldam Hospital, as well as swimming baths and sports facilities.\\n\\nThe colliery became a key source of union radicalism. During the UK Miners\\' Strike, there were numerous disturbances in the area. It was one of the last pits to return to work after the strike, seeing as it was picketed by a group of hardliners from Kent who continued to picket Frickley after the NUM had called off the strike. The Frickley miners refused to cross the hardliners\\' picket.\\n\\nThe colliery was closed on 26 November 1993 following closures of nearby pits like Ferrymoor-Riddings (1985), Kinsley (1986), South Kirkby (1988) and Grimethorpe (1992). In 1998 the UK Governments \"Social Exclusion Unit\" published a series of \"Policy Action Team\" reports looking at issues of social exclusion. The Skills report used South Elmsall and surrounding towns as a case study and stated \"The local communities still suffer from serious\\nenvironmental, social and economic problems - and a crisis of morale - as a result of the loss of jobs in the mining industry\". \\n\\nSection::::Warde-Aldam Hospital.\\nThe Warde-Aldam Hospital was a hospital situated in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1911 by Carlton Main Colliery Ltd and was used as a general, voluntary hospital until 1948. It was then taken over by the NHS and provided acute hospital care until 1978.\\n\\nSection::::Music.\\nThe town is home to Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band, a successful brass band who have previously been British and European champions.\\n\\nSection::::Frickley Country Park.\\nFrickley Country Park officially opened in September 2009, after a long period of land reclamation, environmental cleaning and landscaping of the former Frickley Colliery site was finished. The site offers walks and play areas as well as space for new housing development as part of the wider regeneration scheme. Nearby is located the Frickley Off-road Centre, a specialist facility for motorsports.\\n\\nSection::::Local economy.\\nThe large, traditional market is a central feature of the shopping area of the town, with approximately 105 trading stalls. On the main high street there are shops featuring many household names such as The Post Office, Hallmark Cards, Specsavers, Boots Group and Greggs alongside many other independent shops offering a range of goods and services such as travel, boutique fashion, wedding dress hire, sportswear and much more.\\n\\nOn the outskirts of the town is the Dale Lane Industrial Estate which is home to a number of large, internationally recognised companies. For example, there are a number of Next Distribution warehouses. The estate itself reflects the change in industry of the area, being one of the key expansion areas since the closure of the local collieries.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nCarlton, Moorthorpe, Northfield and Ash Grove are the primary education schools in South Elmsall. The main source of secondary and further education in the town is Minsthorpe Community College, which also provides places to residents of South Kirkby and Upton. In 2008 Minsthorpe Community College gained its best ever results at all levels – KS3/GCSE/A-Level, the college GCSE results are higher than the local and national averages.\\n\\nThe school also hosts a number of other facilities such as a sports and fitness suite, all weather floodlit sports pitches, a gym and an upcoming public swimming pool. The school and its science and sporting facilities were upgraded as one of the host training facilities for the London 2012 Olympic Games.\\n\\nAmong a number of well known people who have an association with Minsthorpe include playwright John Godber, actors Adrian Hood and Chris Walker and footballers Jamie and John McCombe.\\n\\nSection::::Transport.\\nSouth Elmsall is served by rail, the nearest stations being South Elmsall railway station. The main bus station is also situated beside the railway station.\\n\\nSection::::Churches.\\nThe principal places of Christian worship include:\\n\\nNon-Christian places of religious/spiritual interest:\\n\\nSection::::Sports.\\nFrickley Athletic are based in South Elmsall.

She served in the cabinets of Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nPrior to entering politics, she was a lawyer, community activist and volunteer. Broten attended McMaster University from 1986 to 1990, and has both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree from the institution. She also received an LL.B. from the University of Western Ontario in 1993. She was a law clerk to Madam Justice Claire L\\'Heureux-Dubé at the Supreme Court of Canada from 1993 to 1994, and later had a practice in civil and commercial litigation. She has also served as Chair of the Board of Directors for the Gatehouse, a community centre for survivors of child abuse.\\n\\nIn 2007, Broten and her husband were criticized after they applied for a permit to build a large two-storey garage behind their home. Dubbed the \"garage mahal\" by neighbours, the structure was meant to hold the couple\\'s four vehicles. The plan was notable at the time due to Broten\\'s position as the Minister of the Environment. Following a public outcry and stories in the media, plans to build the garage were cancelled.\\n\\nBroten, her husband, and their two children moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2013.\\n\\nSection::::Provincial politics.\\nBroten ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Morley Kells in Etobicoke-Lakeshore by 5,156 votes. She ran again in the 2003 election, and defeated Kells by 6,722 votes amid a provincial shift to the Liberals.\\n\\nSection::::38th Legislative Assembly.\\nOn October 23, 2003, she was named as the Parliamentary Assistant to Premier Dalton McGuinty. In this role she conducted province-wide consultations to develop meaningful reforms to address domestic violence in Ontario. This led to the Government’s Domestic Violence Action Plan which included a groundbreaking public education campaign. She also chaired the Premier’s Shared Air Summit, which drew scientists and policy makers from across North America to tackle the linked issues of smog and transboundary air pollution.\\n\\nShe introduced two private member bills in 2004. The first, entitled \"Kids First Licences Act\", proposed to allow drivers to make charitable donations to children\\'s charities whenever they renewed their vehicle licence. The second, called \"Workplace Violence and Workplace Harassment\" (an amendment to the \"Occupational Health and Safety Act\"), proposed to impose additional duties and responsibilities in workplaces.\\n\\nOn June 29, 2005, Broten was appointed to cabinet as Minister of the Environment. As minister, she developed policies under one of Canada’s most comprehensive Climate Change Plans in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She also introduced the Clean Water Act designed to better safeguard Ontario’s drinking water.\\n\\nSection::::39th Legislative Assembly.\\nBroten was re-elected in 2007, and was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. While there, she authored a report detailing a Five Point Action Plan to create more opportunities and reduce barriers for internationally trained doctors in Ontario. Her report formed the basis for new legislation in 2008.\\n\\nIn 2008, she introduced legislation that imposes a duty to report images of child abuse. The following year she unanimously passed a resolution calling for a review of reporting standards for listed companies.\\n\\nIn 2009, Broten was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. On October 7 that year, she was appointed Minister of Children and Youth Services and Minister Responsible for Women\\'s Issues.\\n\\nSection::::40th Legislative Assembly.\\nIn 2011, Broten was re-elected again.

The following year she was hired by the provincial government, headed by Liberal Premier Stephen McNeil, to conduct a tax review. In January 2015, she was appointed President and CEO of Nova Scotia Business Inc.\\n\\nSection::::Post-political career.\\nAfter she resigned from the Ontario Cabinet and legislature, Broten and her family eventually settled in Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia. She had initially stated that she was moving to Halifax, for her husband Paul obtained a job at Emera as special counsel for senior projects.\\n\\nNot long after Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil\\'s Liberal Party swept to electoral victory, she was hired as a government consultant to lead a comprehensive review of the taxation in the province. Her final report, released on November 19, 2014, made 22 recommendations on taxation; these included eliminating the tax bracket for high-income ($150,000 and over) earners, eliminating refundable tax credits, eliminating a tax rebate for seniors, reducing corporate taxes for large businesses, introducing a carbon tax and expanding the HST to include numerous exempt products including books, children\\'s clothes, diapers, and feminine hygiene products. Broten\\'s report was generally panned, and Nova Scotia Finance Minister Diana Whalen subsequently scheduled several public consultations across the province in the winter of 2015. On March 25, 2015, Whalen said \"every recommendation in the Broten review is [being] looked at\", including a carbon tax, but only explicitly ruled out increasing the HST on books and eliminating a volunteer firefighter tax credit.\\n\\nOn January 14, 2015, Broten was selected by the Nova Scotia Business Incorporated (NSBI) board to the position of President and CEO of NSBI.

Employers generally have to pay workers the highest minimum wage prescribed by federal, state, and local law. Since July 24, 2009, the federal government has mandated a nationwide minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2017 to 2018, eight states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in eleven other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.\\n\\nUsing 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars, the federal minimum wage peaked at $11.79 per hour in 1968. If the minimum wage in 1968 had kept up with labor\\'s productivity growth, it would have reached $19.33 in 2017. There is a racial difference in support for a higher minimum wage with most Black and Latino individuals supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of Whites opposing it. about 2% of White, Asian, and Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less. Amongst Black workers, the percentage was about 3%.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nMinimum wage legislation emerged at the end of the nineteenth century from the desire to end sweated labor which had developed in the wake of industrialization. Sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered nonliving wages that did not allow workers to afford the necessaries of life. Besides substandard wages, sweating was also associated with long work hours and unsanitary work conditions. From the 1890s to the 1920s, during the Progressive Era, a time of social activists and political reform across the United States, progressive reformers, women\\'s organizations, religious figures, academics, and politicians all played an important role in getting state minimum wage laws passed throughout the United States.\\n\\nThe first successful attempts at using minimum wage laws to ameliorate the problem of nonliving wages occurred in the Australian state of Victoria in 1896. Factory inspector reports and newspaper reporting on the conditions of sweated labor in Melbourne, Victoria led in 1895 to the formation of the National Anti-Sweating League which pushed the government aggressively to deal legislatively with the problem of substandard wages. The government, following the recommendation of the Victorian Chief Secretary Alexander Peacock, established wage boards which were tasked with establishing minimum wages in the labor trades which suffered from nonlivable wages. During the same time period, campaigns against sweated labor were occurring in the United States and England.\\n\\nSection::::Progressive Era.\\nAs in Australia, civic concern for sweated labor developed in the United States towards the end of the Gilded Age. In New York state in 1890, a group of female reformers who were worried about the harsh conditions of sweated labor in the country formed the Consumer\\'s League of the City of New York. The consumer group sought to improve working conditions by boycotting products which were made under sweated conditions and did not conform to a code of \"fair house\" standards drawn up by them. Similar, consumer leagues formed throughout the United States, and in 1899, they united under the National Consumer League (NCL) parent organization. Consumer advocacy, however, was extremely slow at changing conditions in the sweated industries. When NCL leaders in 1908 went to an international anti-sweatshop conference in Geneva, Switzerland and were introduced to Australian minimum wage legislation, which had successfully dealt with sweated labor, they came home believers and made minimum wage legislation part of their national platform.\\nIn 1910, in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League, the Women\\'s Trade Union League (WTLU) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts. Over the next two years, a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state. On June 4, 1912, Massachusetts passed the first minimum wage legislation in the United States, which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children. The passage of the bill was significantly assisted by the Lawrence textile strike which had raged for ten weeks at the beginning of 1912. The strike brought national attention to the plight of the low wage textile workers, and pushed the state legislatures, who feared the magnitude of the strike, to enact progressive labor legislation.\\n\\nBy 1923, fifteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia had passed minimum wage laws, with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women\\'s voluntary associations and organized labor. The United States Supreme Court of the \"Lochner\" era (1897–1937), however, consistently invalidated labor regulation laws. Advocates for state minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of \"Muller v. Oregon\" (1908), which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not. The Supreme Court, however, did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws. The court ruled in \"Adkins v. Children\\'s Hospital\" (1923) that the District of Columbia\\'s minimum wage law was unconstitutional, because the law interfered with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees. The court also noted that women did not require anymore special protection by the law, following the passage in 1920 of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote and equal legal status.\\n\\nSection::::New Deal.\\nIn 1933, the Roosevelt administration during the New Deal made the first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage regiment with the National Industrial Recovery Act, which set minimum wage and maximum hours on an industry and regional basis. The Supreme Court, however, in \"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States\" (1935) ruled the act unconstitutional, and the minimum wage regulations were abolished. Two years later after President Roosevelt\\'s overwhelming reelection in 1936 and discussion of judicial reform, the Supreme Court took up the issue of labor legislation again in \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\" (1937) and upheld the constitutionality of minimum wage legislation enacted by Washington state and overturned the \"Adkins\" decision which marked the end of the \"Lochner\" era. In 1938, the minimum wage was re-established pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act, this time at a uniform rate of $0.25 per hour (). The Supreme Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in \"United States v. Darby Lumber Co.\" (1941), holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions.\\n\\nThe 1938 minimum wage law only applied to \"employees engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce,\" but in amendments in 1961 and 1966, the federal minimum wage was extended (with slightly different rates) to employees in large retail and service enterprises, local transportation and construction, state and local government employees, as well as other smaller expansions; a grandfather clause in 1990 drew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy, which now set the wage at $3.80.\\n\\nSection::::Legislation.\\nThe federal minimum wage in the United States was reset to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in July 2009. Some U.S. territories (such as American Samoa) are exempt. Some types of labor are also exempt: Employers may pay tipped labor a minimum of $2.13 per hour, as long as the hour wage plus tip income equals at least the minimum wage. Persons under the age of 20 may be paid $4.25 an hour for the first 90 calendar days of employment (sometimes known as a youth, teen, or training wage) unless a higher state minimum exists. The 2009 increase was the last of three steps of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which was signed into law as a rider to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans\\' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, a bill that also contained almost $5 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.\\n\\nSection::::Inflation indexing.\\nSome politicians in the United States advocate linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index, thereby increasing the wage automatically each year based on increases to the consumer price index. Linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index avoids the erosion of the purchasing power of the minimum wage with time because of inflation. In 1998 Washington state became the first state to approve consumer price indexing for its minimum wage. In 2003 San Francisco, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico were the first cities to approve consumer price indexing for their minimum wage. Oregon and Florida were the next states to link their minimum wages to the consumer price index. Later in 2006, voters in six states (Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio) approved statewide increases in the state minimum wage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour, and all increases were designed to annually index to inflation. As of 2018, the minimum wage is indexed to inflation in 17 states.\\n\\nSection::::Living wage protests.\\nSince 2012, a growing protest and advocacy movement called \"Fight for $15\", initially growing out of fast food worker strikes, has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage. Since the start of these protests, a number of states and cities have increased their minimum wage. In 2014 Connecticut for instance passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 per hour by 2017, making it one of about six states at the time to aim at or above $10.00 per hour. In 2014 and 2015, several cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour. In 2016 New York and California became the first states to pass legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in each state, followed by Massachusetts in 2018.\\n\\nIn April 2014, the U.S. Senate debated the minimum wage on the federal level by way of the Minimum Wage Fairness Act. The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which were successful in all four states. The results provided evidence that raising minimum wage has support across party lines.\\n\\nIn April 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Patty Murray, backed by 28 of the Senate\\'s Democrats, introduced new federal legislation which would raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024 and index it to inflation. The Raise the Wage Act of 2017, which was simultaneously introduced in the House of Representatives with 166 Democratic cosponsors, would raise the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour immediately, and then gradually increase it to $15 per hour by 2024, while simultaneously raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and phasing it out. The legislation was introduced according to Senator Bernie Sanders to make sure that every worker has at least a modest and decent standard of living.\\n\\nSection::::State laws.\\nIn the United States, different states are able to set their own minimum wages independent of the federal government. When the state and federal minimum wage differ the higher wage prevails. there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. Washington has the highest state minimum wage at $11.50 per hour. A number of states have also in recent years enacted state preemption laws, which restrict local community rights, and bar local governments from setting their own minimum wage amounts. state preemption laws for local minimum wages have passed in 25 states.\\n\\nLegislation has passed recently in multiple states that significantly raises the minimum wage. California and Illinois are both set to raise their minimum wage to $15.00 per hour by January 1, 2023 and 2025 respectively. Colorado is set to raise its minimum wage from $9.30 per hour to $12 per hour by January 1, 2020, rising $0.90 per year. New York has also passed legislation to increase its minimum wage to $15.00 per hour over time, certain counties and larger companies are set on faster schedules than others. A number of other cities and states across the country are also debating and enacting legislation to increase the minimum wage for low wage workers to a livable wage.\\n\\nSection::::Local ordinances.\\nSome government entities, such as counties and cities, observe minimum wages that are higher than the state as a whole. In 2003 San Francisco, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico were the first two cities to introduce local minimum wage ordinances. Another device to increase wages locally are living wage ordinances, which generally apply only to businesses that are under contract to the local government itself. In 1994 Baltimore, Maryland was the first city in the United States to pass such a living wage ordinance. These targeted living wage ordinances for city contract workers have led in subsequent years to citywide local minimum wage laws which apply to all workers.\\n\\nIn the current wave of minimum wage legislative action, Seattle, Washington was the first city to pass on June 2, 2014 a local ordinance to increase the minimum wage for all workers to $15.00 per hour, which phases in over seven years. This ordinance followed the referendum in SeaTac, Washington in November 2013, which raised on a more limited scale the local minimum wage to $15.00 for transportation and hospitality workers. Numerous other cities have followed Seattle\\'s example since. San Francisco became the first major city in the U.S. to reach a minimum wage of $15.00 per hour on July 1, 2018. New York City\\'s minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018. The minimum wage in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., will be $15.00 per hour in 2020. Similarly, the minimum wage in Minneapolis, Minnesota will be $15.00 per hour by 2022. A growing number of other California cities have also enacted local minimum wage ordinances to increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour, including Berkeley, El Cerrito, Emeryville, Mountain View, Oakland, Richmond, and San Jose.\\n\\nSection::::Union exemptions.\\nSome minimum wage ordinances have an exemption for unionized workers. For instance, the Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum salary in 2014 for hotel workers of $15.37 per hour which has such an exemption. This led in some cases to longtime workers at unionized hotels such as the Sheraton Universal making $10.00 per hour, whereas non-union employees at a non-union Hilton less than 500 feet away making at least $15.37 as mandated by law for non-unionized employees. Similar exemptions have been adopted in other cities. As of December 2014, unions were exempt from minimum wage ordinances in Chicago, Illinois, SeaTac, Washington, and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as well as the California cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Long Beach, San Jose, Richmond, and Oakland. In 2016, the District of Columbia Council passed a minimum wage ordinance that included a union waiver, but Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed it. Later that year, the council approved an increase without the union waiver.\\n\\nSection::::Historical trend.\\nThe federal minimum wage was introduced in 1938 at the rate of $0.25 per hour (). By 1950 the minimum wage had risen to $0.75 per hour. The minimum wage had its highest purchasing power in 1968, when it was $1.60 per hour (). The real value of the Federal minimum wage in 2016 dollars has decreased by one-third since 1968. The minimum wage would be $11 in 2016 if its real value had remained at the 1968 level. From January 1981 to April 1990, the minimum wage was frozen at $3.35 per hour, then a record-setting minimum wage freeze. From September 1, 1997 through July 23, 2007, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $5.15 per hour, breaking the old record. In 2009 the minimum wage was adjusted to $7.25 where it has remained fixed for the past nine years.\\n\\nThe purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has fluctuated. Since 1984, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has decreased. Measured in real terms (adjusted for inflation) using 1984 dollars, the real minimum wage was $3.35 in 1984, $2.33 in 1994, $1.84 in 2004, and $1.46 in 2014. If the minimum wage had been raised to $10.10 in 2014, that would have equated to $4.40 in 1984 dollars. This would have been equal to a 31% increase in purchasing power, despite the nominal value of the minimum wage increasing by 216% in the same time period.\\n\\nSection::::Economic effects.\\nThe economic effects of raising the minimum wage are unclear. Adjusting the minimum wage may affect current and future levels of employment, prices of goods and services, economic growth, income inequality, and poverty. The interconnection of price levels, central bank policy, wage agreements, and total aggregate demand creates a situation in which conclusions drawn from macroeconomic analysis are highly influenced by the underlying assumptions of the interpreter.\\n\\nSection::::Employment.\\nIn neoclassical economics, the law of demand states that—all else being equal—raising the price of any particular good or service reduces the quantity demanded. Therefore, neoclassical economists argue that—all else being equal—raising the minimum wage will have adverse effects on employment. Conceptually, if an employer does not believe a worker generates value equal to or in excess of the minimum wage, they do not hire or retain that worker.\\n\\nOther economists of different schools of thought argue that a limited increase in the minimum wage does not affect or increases the number of jobs available. Economist David Cooper for instance estimates that a higher minimum wage would support the creation of at least 85,000 new jobs in the United States. This divergence of thought began with empirical work on fast food workers in the 1990s which challenged the neoclassical model. In 1994, economists David Card and Alan Krueger studied employment trends among 410 restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania following New Jersey\\'s minimum wage hike (from $4.25 to $5.05) in April 1992. They found \"no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\" In contrast, a 1995 analysis of the evidence by David Neumark found that the increase in New Jersey\\'s minimum wage resulted in a 4.6% decrease in employment. Neumark\\'s study relied on payroll records from a sample of large fast-food restaurant chains, whereas the Card-Krueger study relied on business surveys.\\nA literature review conducted by David Neumark and William Wascher in 2007 (which surveyed 101 studies related to the employment effects of minimum wages) found that about two-thirds of peer-reviewed economic research showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment—especially for young and unskilled workers. Neumark\\'s review further found that, when looking at only the most credible research, 85% of studies showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment.\\n\\nStatistical meta-analysis conducted by Tom Stanley in 2005 in contrast found that there is evidence of publication bias in minimum wage literature, and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment. In 2008 Hristos Doucouliagos and Tom Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on disemployment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger\\'s initial claim of publication bias was correct. Moreover, they concluded, \"Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains.\"\\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2014 estimated the theoretical effects of a federal minimum wage increase under two scenarios: an increase to $9.00 and an increase to $10.10. According to the report, approximately 100,000 jobs would be lost under the $9.00 option, whereas 500,000 jobs would be lost under the $10.10 option (with a wide range of possible outcomes). The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) in contrast in 2013 found in a review of multiple studies since 2000 that there was \"little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage.\" CEPR found in a later study that job creation within the United States is faster within states that raised their minimum wage. In 2014 the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation, Washington, exceeded the national average for job growth in the United States. Washington had a job growth rate 0.3% faster than the national average job growth rate.\\n\\nA 2012 study led by Joseph Sabia estimated that the 2004-6 New York State minimum wage increase (from $5.15 to $6.75) resulted in a 20.2% to 21.8% reduction in employment for less-skilled, less-educated workers. Similarly, a study led by Richard Burkhauser in 2000 concluded that minimum wage increases \"significantly reduce the employment of the most vulnerable groups in the working-age population—young adults without a high school degree (aged 20-24), young black adults and teenagers (aged 16-24), and teenagers (aged 16-19).\"\\n\\n\"The Economist\" wrote in December 2013 in sum that: \"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage...High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world\\'s highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, a study from the University of Washington found that increasing the minimum wage in Seattle resulted in minimum wage earners making $125 less each month due to employers\\'s cutting hours.\\n\\nSection::::Prices.\\nConceptually, raising the minimum wage increases the cost of labor, ceteris paribus. Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, substitute other products, or switch to imported products, due to the effects of price elasticity of demand. Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases. However, there are studies that show that higher prices for products due to increased labor cost are usually only by about 0.4% of the original price.\\n\\nSection::::Effects on crime.\\nA 2016 White House report based on \"back of envelope calculations and literature review\" argued that higher hourly wages led to less crime. The study by the Council of Economic Advisers calculated that \"raising the minimum wage reduces crime by 3 to 5 percent.\" To get those numbers, the study assumed that \"such a minimum wage increase would have no employment impacts, with an employment elasticity of 0.1 the benefits would be somewhat lower.\"\\n\\nIn contrast in a 1987 journal article, Masanori Hashimoto noted that minimum wage hikes lead to increased levels of property crime in areas affected by the minimum wage after its increase. According to the article, by decreasing employment in poor communities, total legal trade and production are curtailed. The report also argued that to compensate for the decrease in legal avenues for production and consumption, poor communities increasingly turn to illegal trade and activity.\\n\\nSection::::Economic growth.\\nWhether growth (GDP, a measure of both income and production) increases or decreases depends significantly on whether the income shifted from owners to workers results in an overall higher level of spending. The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the marginal propensity to consume or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment. Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.\\n\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the second half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would result in a net $1 billion increase in income.\\n\\nSection::::Income inequality.\\nAn increase in the minimum wage is a form of redistribution from higher-income persons (business owners or \"capital\") to lower income persons (workers or \"labor\") and therefore should reduce income inequality. The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described above would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times the poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their business profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with incomes below that threshold would rise.\\n\\nSection::::Poverty.\\nAmong hourly-paid workers In 2016, 701,000 earned the federal minimum wage and about 1.5 million earned wages below the minimum.Together, these 2.2 million workers represented 2.7% of all hourly-paid workers.\\n\\nThe CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage would reduce the number of persons below the poverty income threshold by 900,000 under the $10.10 option versus 300,000 under the $9.00 option. Similarly, Arindrajit Dube, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst, found in a 2017 study \"robust evidence that higher minimum wages lead to increases in incomes among families at the bottom of the income distribution and that these wages reduce the poverty rate.\" According to the study \"a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces the nonelderly poverty rate by about 5 percent.\"\\n\\nIn contrast, research conducted by David Neumark and colleagues in 2004 found that minimum wages are associated with reductions in the hours and employment of low-wage workers. A separate study by the same researchers found that minimum wages tend to increase the proportion of families with incomes below or near the poverty line. Similarly, a 2002 study led by Richard Vedder, professor of economics at Ohio University, concluded that \"The empirical evidence is strong that minimum wages have had little or no effect on poverty in the U.S. Indeed, the evidence is stronger that minimum wages occasionally increase poverty…\"\\n\\nAccording to a large majority of economists, minimum wage increases result in a variety of negative effects for lower-skilled workers including reduced employment, reduced hours, reduced benefits, and less safe working conditions.\\n\\nSection::::Federal budget deficit.\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that \"[T]he net effect on the federal budget of raising the minimum wage would probably be a small decrease in budget deficits for several years but a small increase in budget deficits thereafter. It is unclear whether the effect for the coming decade as a whole would be a small increase or a small decrease in budget deficits.\" On the cost side, the report cited higher wages paid by the government to some of its employees along with higher costs for certain procured goods and services. This might be offset by fewer government benefits paid, as some workers with higher incomes would receive fewer government transfer payments. On the revenue side, some would pay higher taxes and others less.\\n\\nSection::::Commentary.\\nSection::::Economists.\\nAccording to a survey conducted by economist Greg Mankiw, 79% of economists agreed that \"a minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers.\"\\n\\nA 2015 survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that a majority of economists believes raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have negative effects on youth employment levels (83%), adult employment levels (52%), and the number of jobs available (76%). Additionally, 67% of economists surveyed believed that a $15 minimum wage would make it harder for small businesses with less than 50 employees to stay in business.\\n\\nA 2006 survey conducted by economist Robert Whaples of a sample of 210 Ph.D. economists randomly selected from the American Economic Association, found that, regarding the U.S. minimum wage:\\n\\nIn 2014, over 600 economists signed a letter in support of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 with research suggesting that a minimum wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth. Also, seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences were among 75 economists endorsing an increase in the minimum wage for U.S. workers and said \"the weight\" of economic research shows higher pay doesn\\'t lead to fewer jobs.\\n\\nAccording to a February 2013 survey of the University of Chicago IGM Forum, which includes approximately 40 economists:\\n\\nAccording to a fall 2000 survey conducted by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists surveyed agreed that minimum wage laws increase unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with the statement.\\n\\nEconomist Paul Krugman advocated raising the minimum wage moderately in 2013, citing several reasons, including:\\n\\nSection::::Major political parties.\\nDemocratic candidates, elected officials, and activists support an increase in the minimum wage. In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama called for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour; several months later, Democrats Tom Harkin and George Miller proposed legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10; and in 2015, congressional Democrats introduced a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. These efforts did not succeed, but increases in city and state minimum wages prompted congressional Democrats to continue fighting for an increase on the federal level. After much internal party debate, the party\\'s official platform adopted at the 2016 Democratic National Convention stated: \"We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it, give all Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy so every worker can earn at least $15 an hour.\"\\n\\nMost Republican elected officials oppose action to increase the minimum wage, and have blocked Democratic efforts to increase the minimum wage. Republican leadership such as Speakers of the House John Boehner and Paul Ryan have opposed minimum wage increases. Some Republicans oppose having a minimum wage altogether, while a few, conversely, have supported minimum wage increases or indexing the minimum wage to inflation.\\n\\nSection::::Polls.\\nThe Pew Center reported in January 2014 that 73% of Americans supported raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10. By party, 53% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats favored this action. Pew found a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage in 2017 with most blacks and Hispanics supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.\\n\\nA Lake Research Partners poll in February 2012 found the following:\\n\\nSection::::List by jurisdiction.\\nThis is a list of the minimum wages (per hour) in each state and territory of the United States, for jobs covered by federal minimum wage laws. If the job is not subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, then state, city, or other local laws may determine the minimum wage. A common exemption to the federal minimum wage is a company having revenue of less than $500,000 per year while not engaging in any interstate commerce.\\n\\nUnder the federal law, workers who receive a portion of their salary from tips, such as waitstaff, are required only to have their total compensation, including tips, meet the minimum wage. Therefore, often, their hourly wage, before tips, is less than the minimum wage. Seven states, and Guam, do not allow for a tip credit. Additional exemptions to the minimum wage include many seasonal employees, student employees, and certain disabled employees as specified by the FLSA.\\n\\nIn addition, some counties and cities within states may implement a higher minimum wage than the rest of their state. Sometimes this higher wage applies only to businesses that contract with the local government, while in other cases the higher minimum applies to all work.\\n\\nSection::::State.\\nThe average US minimum wage per capita (2017) is $8.49 based on the population size of each state and generally represents the average minimum wage experienced by a person working in one of the fifty US states. Cities, counties, districts, and territories are not included in the calculation.\\nAs of October 2016, there have been 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2014 to 2015, nine states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in 11 other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.\\nBeginning in January 2017, Massachusetts and Washington state have the highest minimum wages in the country, at $11.00 per hour. New York City\\'s minimum wage for companies with 11 or more employees became $15.00 per hour on December 31, 2018. On the same day, NYC\\'s hourly minimum wage for companies with 10 or fewer employees became $13.50. The minimum wage in Illinois will reach $15 per hour by 2025 with increases beginning in 2020.\\n\\nSection::::Large corporations.\\nSome large employers in the traditionally low-paying retail sector have declared an internal minimum wage.

It is a prostrate shrub with lance-shaped leaves and white, rarely deep mauve flowers.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\n\"Eremophila debilis\" is a prostrate shrub with spreading stems up to long. It has glossy green, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves which are mostly long, wide and glabrous usually with 3 or 4 pairs of prominent teeth on the edges.\\n\\nThe flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 3 in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 green, lance-shaped, slightly overlapping sepals mostly long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to pale mauve and, unlike many others in the genus, does not have spots. The petal tube and lobes are mostly glabrous on the outside but the inside of the tube is filled with soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. Flowering mainly occurs in spring and summer and is followed by rounded, fleshy, white to reddish purple fruits, which are in diameter.\\n\\nSection::::Taxonomy and naming.\\nThe species was first formally described by Henry Charles Andrews in 1802 who gave it the name \"Pogonia debilis\". The description was published in \"The Botanist\\'s Repository for New, and Rare Plants\". Robert Brown changed the name to \"Myoporum debile\" in 1810 and in 1992 Robert Chinnock changed the name to \"Eremophila debilis\". The specific epithet (\"debilis\") is a Latin word meaning \"weak\" referring to the decumbent stems of this species.\\n\\nSection::::Distribution and habitat.\\n\"Eremophila debilis\" is widespread in eastern Queensland and New South Wales in a wide range of soils and vegetation associations, often in box and white cypress communities, sometimes forming dense mats. It has been recorded near Boosey in Victoria. It is also present in New Zealand, thought to be the result of naturalisation.\\n\\nSection::::Use in horticulture.\\nWinter apple is well known in horticulture, although often as \"Myoporum debile\". It is suitable as a groundcover in many areas as long as the soil is reasonably well-drained. Its flowers, fruit and foliage are attractive features.

Born in Chester County, Pennsylvania of Scottish descent, Steele worked in the Lancaster post-office as a young man, where he once met James Buchanan.\\n\\nSection::::Early success.\\nWith encouragement from his future brother-in-law Henry Hastings Sibley, Steele saw opportunities in the western frontier and traveled to Fort Snelling via the steamboat \"Burlington\", arriving June 18, 1838; he soon became a storekeeper at the fort. At that time, the land on both sides of the Mississippi River at St. Anthony Falls was controlled by the U.S. Government as part of the Fort Snelling Reservation. However, by 1837 over 150 squatters had staked unofficial claims on fort property. In 1838, the fort commander, Joseph Plympton convinced the government to release the east bank of the river for settlement, hoping to stake a personal claim on the valuable land closest to the Falls. But Steele surreptitiously staked the first claim on the choicest land before sunrise on the first day of legal settlement. He claimed a half-mile of east-bank riverfront, controlling half of the water power of St. Anthony Falls; adjacent property was claimed by Pierre Bottineau (1817–1895), a Métis, of French-Canadian, Ojibwe, and Dakota descent.\\n\\nSteele\\'s sister, Abbian, would marry a prominent physician, Thomas R. Potts in 1847. Potts would become the first Mayor of St. Paul.\\n\\nSection::::Lumber mills.\\nEventually, in 1847, Steele secured financing, in the form of $12,000 for a 9/10 stake in the property. On May 18, 1848 president Polk approved the claims made in St. Anthony, and Steele was able to build his dam on the east side of the river above the Falls, blocking the east channel. The dam extended diagonally into the river , was high, and was secured to the limestone riverbed. Its thickness tapered from wide at its base to wide at the top. Steele dispatched logging crews to the Crow Wing River in December 1847 to supply pine for his sawmill, and by September 1, 1848 sawing commenced using two up-down saws. He was able to sell the lumber readily, supplying construction projects in the booming town. The new community at the Falls attracted entrepreneurs from New England, many of whom had experience in lumber and milling. He had hired Ard Godfrey to help build and run the first commercial sawmill at the Falls. Godfrey knew the most efficient ways to use natural resources, like the falls, and the great pine forests, to make lumber products. Godfrey built the first home in St. Anthony, Steele had the town platted in 1849, and it incorporated in 1855.\\n\\nSection::::Foothold on west bank.\\nAlthough St. Anthony was beginning to prosper, the west side of the Mississippi remained firmly under the control of Fort Snelling. Steele knew that whoever could stake their claim on the west bank of St. Anthony Falls would control the second half of the vast source of water power. Late in 1849, Steele convinced his friend John Stevens to negotiate a deal to secure in present-day Minneapolis. In exchange, Stevens would ferry troops across the river to supply the new Fort Ripley. In the summer of 1851 the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux was \"negotiated\" wresting nearly all remaining Minnesotan land from the Indians. In 1852 Congress passed a bill to relinquish of Ft. Snelling, opening the door for the ultimate development of Minneapolis. By 1854, 300 squatters occupied the area, and in 1855 Congress recognized the squatters\\' right to purchase the land they had claimed. The west side quickly developed scores of new mills and consortia. They built a dam diagonally into the river to the north, which, along with Steele\\'s dam created the inverted V-shape, still apparent today. Steele created the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company in 1856 with three New York financiers. The company struggled for several years, due to poor relations with the financiers, a depression, and the Civil War. In 1868 the firm reorganized with new officers including John Pillsbury, Richard and Samuel Chute, Sumner Farnham, and Frederick Butterfield.\\n\\nSection::::First Mississippi River bridge.\\nThe two communities of Minneapolis and St. Anthony shared the resources of the Falls. Both towns grew quickly and developed a number of industries at the falls. The earliest waterpowered facilities were sawmills; flour mills soon followed. For many years river crossing between the communities was via a rope-drawn ferry, by foot when the river surface was frozen, or on floating log booms that often filled the channel.\\n\\nAlthough he ran one such ferry, as early as 1852, Steele anticipated a need for a permanent bridge to span the river near present-day Hennepin Avenue. He formed the Mississippi Bridge Company to build a -long, wide suspension bridge, linking Minneapolis to Nicollet Island and hired Thomas Griffith to design it. The bridge was opened on 23 January 1855 with a large celebration. As a private enterprise, tolls were levied: five cents per pedestrian, twenty-five cents per horse-drawn wagon, and two cents for swine and sheep.\\n\\nSteele had previously (in 1853) built a shorter bridge to cross the channel from Nicollet Island to St. Anthony; together these created the first permanent bridge to span the Mississippi at any point along its length. They linked the two cities, which legally merged in 1872, taking the name Minneapolis: a compound of the Dakota Indian word, \"minne\" or \"mni\" for \"water\", and the Greek \"polis\" for city.\\n\\nSection::::Purchase of Fort Snelling.\\nBy 1858, Franklin Steele bought the fort and surrounding for $90,000, as the government no longer needed a frontier outpost at that location. But during the Civil War, he leased it back to the government for use as an induction station. After the war was over Steele leased the land to settlers and the city began to grow. The town of Minneapolis became a city in 1867. He ultimately became prosperous from lumber, the suspension bridge, and land deals.\\n\\nSection::::The University of Minnesota.\\nIn 1851 the territorial legislature of Minnesota decided to create a university and four acres (near present-day Central and University Avenues) in St. Anthony was donated by Franklin Steele.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Franklin Steele', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11490867'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1149303', 'text': 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\\n\\nIlsa, She Wolf of the SS is a 1975 Canadian Nazisploitation/sexploitation film directed by Don Edmonds, produced by David F. Friedman and written by Jonah Royston.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nIlsa is Kommandant of a Nazi prison camp, who conducts sadistic scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the German armed forces (it is late in the war and the Nazi military is in dire need of reinforcements). Ilsa is also portrayed as a buxom woman with a voracious sexual appetite for men. Every night, she chooses another of her male prisoners and rapes him. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her current victim eventually ejaculates, and promptly has him castrated and put to death. Only one American prisoner, who can avoid ejaculating, manages to use her weakness to his favor. He hopes that the Allies will arrive soon, but a faction of the SS wants to eliminate all evidence and witnesses.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nWhen Lee Frost and David F. Friedman\\'s 1969 \"Love Camp 7\" became popular in Canada, André Link and Cinepix\\'s John Dunning created a script for \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\". After offering to produce, Friedman agreed and brought in Dyanne Thorne to play the eponymous character. Friedman is credited onscreen as \"Herman Traeger\".\\n\\nIlsa is patterned after real-life murderous female Nazi camp personnel Ilse Koch and Irma Grese.\\n\\nFriedman (under the pseudonym Herman Traeger) put a notice before the film opens: \"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as \\'medical experiments\\' in special concentration camps throughout Hitler\\'s Third Reich. Although these crimes against humanity are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\"\\n\\nSection::::Location.\\nThe film was made on the Culver City set of the TV series \"Hogan\\'s Heroes\". The series had already been cancelled and the show\\'s producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, saving them the cost of having it demolished.\\n\\nSection::::Release.\\n\"Ilsa\" was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1975 and banned in Australia, Germany, and Norway.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\n\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% \"Rotten\" at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews. \"The Independent Film Journal\" wrote, \"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,\" a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... \\'Ilsa\\' plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \"see it, because I\\'m certain they would then remove it.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \"could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade—and the funniest. It\\'s set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader described the film as \"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\", which \"wasn\\'t notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\". \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\". The film\\'s director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \"the worst piece of shit I ever read\".\\n\\nSection::::Accolades.\\n\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 AVN awards.\\n\\nSection::::Sequels.\\n\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" was followed by three sequels, all variations on the sexploitation women in prison theme: \"Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks\" in 1976, \"Ilsa, the Wicked Warden\" in 1977, directed by Jesús Franco (the film was also known as \"Greta, The Mad Butcher\", \"Wanda, The Wicked Warden\" and \"Ilsa: Absolute Power\") and–also in 1977–\"Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia\".\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1149303'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11493963', 'text': 'MAZ-535\\n\\nMAZ-535 is a Soviet/Russian army vehicle, an artillery tractor designed and developed by MAZ in Belarus.

At an early age he accompanied his mother when she moved to New York City, and later to Brooklyn, New York. He enlisted in the Navy February 26, 1892 at age 16 as apprentice, third class. He married Sadie M. Simonson. He was honorably discharged October 25, 1896, with a rank of apprentice, first class. He reenlisted May 3, 1897 as seaman, and rose to the rank of chief yeoman on February 1, 1898.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of Santiago.\\nChief Yeoman Ellis was killed 3 July 1898 while serving on the \"USS Brooklyn\" during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. During the battle, he was reporting ranges of enemy vessels which he read from the stadimeter, a rangefinding device, while observing from an exposed position, while the \"Brooklyn\" was under fire from as many as four Spanish ships. Yeoman Ellis was considered an expert with the stadimeter. While the Brooklyn was pursuing fleeing Spanish armored cruisers \"Vizcaya\" and \"Cristóbal Colón\", Ellis took a position about three feet in front of the forward turret. He was \"singing out\" the ranges to a messenger, who passed them to the guncrews inside the turrets. He was decapitated when a large shell fired from a Spanish ship struck him in the face. His brain and blood were thrown over a number of people. When an ensign and the ship\\'s doctor started to pick up Ellis\\'s body to throw it over the side, as was a common practice in naval battles, they were stopped by Commodore Schley, who said \"No! Do not throw that body overboard! One who has fought so gallantly deserves the honor of a Christian burial.\"\\n\\nEllis was buried with military honors in Guantanamo, Cuba at Camp McCalla, and later re-buried at Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York, on November 28, 1898. The funeral at Washington Avenue Baptist Church in Brooklyn had a capacity crowd of 2,000 mourners, with thousands more turned away. Soon after the battle, the officers and men of the Brooklyn took up a collection to benefit Ellis\\'s widow, some contributing over a month\\'s pay, to reach a total of over $1,000.

His brother was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was Joan Fitzalan, Countess of Hereford.\\n\\nSection::::High office.\\nJohn was appointed Lord Marshal of England by Richard II of England in 1377, and summoned to the House of Lords on 4 August 1377, by writ directed \"Johanni de Arundell\". He served as Lord Marshal until 1379.\\n\\nOn 26 July 1379 he was given licence to crenellate (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as Betchworth Castle.\\n\\nSection::::Naval victory.\\nBeing in command of a naval expedition in aid to the Duke of Brittany, he defeated the French fleet off the coast of Cornwall.\\n\\nSection::::Death at sea.\\nCommanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the Duke of Brittany, Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men \"took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped\" those they found inside. Further to this Sir John \"allowed his men to ransack the countryside as they liked and to impoverish the people\". When the force eventually set out to sea, carrying with them goods stolen from a nearby church and under a pronouncement of excommunication from the wronged priests, the expedition was caught in a storm. Thomas Walsingham reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned.\\n\\nAccording to Thomas Walsingham\\'s story, FitzAlan\\'s men profaned a convent at or near Southampton, and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near Scariff according to some authorities, but at Cape Clear Island according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews. Froissart\\'s account of the event differs essentially from Walsingham\\'s, in the omission of the story of the desecration of the convent.\\n\\nSection::::Burial.\\nHe was buried in Lewes, Sussex.\\n\\nHe was also an ancestor of the poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley.\\n\\nSection::::Marriage and children.\\nOn 17 February 1358, FitzAlan married Eleanor Maltravers (Mautravers) (1345 – 10 January 1404/1406), daughter of John Maltravers and Gwenthin.

In a participant government, citizens who wish to have a say in government can participate in it. Demokratia excluded women, foreigners, and slaves. It barred between 80 and 90 percent of the population from political rights.\\n\\nThe word demokratia comes from δῆμος \"demos\" \"people\" and \"kratos\" \"power\": \"the people hold power.\" \"Demos\", including the lower classes, had political equality and notwhile respecting laws and institutions, was given full and absolute control of power and government.\"\\n\\nIn some languages, including Finnish and Italian, Demokratia is a word simply meaning democracy.\\n\\nQuoted from MODERN AMERICA AND THE RELIGION OF DEMOCRACY (Internet archive) by Loren J Samons II:\\n\\nIn classical Athens, religion suffused every aspect of public life, from the theater to the military to the political assembly. The state (that is, the citizens) sponsored religious festivals and actively participated in the propitiation and worship of the gods. This fact well illustrates the way the various aspects of Athenian society\\xa0— religious, political, economic, and social\\xa0— overlapped with and affected one another, and the way every Athenian found himself set firmly within a matrix of duties to the gods, to his family, and to his fellow citizens. The principle of necessary duties (especially to protect the family, to serve the polis, and to propitiate the gods) formed the basic structure of Athenian society, and gave meaning to each religious, economic, military, and political act. In such an environment, it was impossible for the Athenians abjectly to worship a form of government, demokratia, even after they had made it a goddess. The idea that the \"freedom to make choices\" or \"diversity\" were absolute goods and thus could serve as goals or ideals (on a level with, much less above, family, gods, or polis) contradicted the very premises of Athenian society. Thus while democratic practices ultimately had a marked and deleterious effect on Athenian national strength and public morale and arguably contributed to the loss of Athenian independence, Athenian society managed to stave off the most harmful aspects of democratic theory. Even after they lost their democracy and autonomy, there is little evidence that the Athenians completely lost their fundamental conception of a society based on the principle of duties.\\nSection::::Literature.\\nI.

The word is constructed from the Greek: \"orismos\" (definition) and \"logos\" (word, reasoning, study). \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe word was coined by William Kirby and William Spence in their \"Introduction to Entomology\" in the early 1800s: \"In the \"terminology\", or what, to avoid the barbarism of a word compounded of Latin and Greek, [Kirby and Spence] would beg to call \"orismology\" of the science, they have endeavoured to introduce throughout a greater degree of precision and concinnity\" in the terms used to talk about insects. This approach to definition is particularly applied to disciplines in natural sciences like Kirby and Spence\\'s entomology that depend upon classificatory schemes, such as taxonomies and ontologies, to organize, name, and address their subject matter. Since the emergence of the discipline of terminology, the use of \"orismology\" has been specialized to definitions and returned to its Greek roots. In the construction of glossaries, that is, specialized dictionaries within a specified domain of discourse, \"orismology\" is generally taken as the complement of \"nomenography\", the study of terms necessary and sufficient for discourse within a specified domain.\\nThe \"Imperial Dictionary\" (1882) reported: \"that branch of natural history which relates to the explanation of the technical terms of the science.\"\\n\\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (1909) reported: \"A name for the explanation of technical terms, or for such terms collectively; terminology.\"\\n\\nIn Elk\\'s view, \"orismology\" includes etymology and should not be confused with terminology, which focuses on current and immediate interpretations of words. He gives this example: The drug name \"penicillin\" was coined by Alexander Fleming from the Latin for \"paintbrush\", which is \"penicillus\". \"Methicillin\", a type of penicillin, gained its name by attaching the stem \"-cillin\" (from the United States Adopted Names Council\\'s list of stems) to a prefix \"meth\" which has no inherent meaning. The study of penicillin and methicillin individually would be an etymological study of terminology. However, the study of methicillin as its name derived from penicillin historically might best be described, according to Elk, as \"orismologic\". Elk\\'s use of the words \"orismology\" and \"terminology\" echo the historical notions of Kirby and Spence rather than modern disciplinary senses of these words. Orismology does not entail etymology, but nomenography may well delve into etymological analysis to construct such neologisms as are needed to satisfy logical requirements for terms within a domain of discourse. Orismology and nomenography are studies overlapping both terminology and specialized lexicography.\\n', 'title': 'Orismology', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11516814'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11519092', 'text': 'Varászló\\n\\nVarászló is a village in Somogy county, Hungary.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Varászló', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11519092'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11519170', 'text': 'Have Heart\\n\\nHave Heart is an American straight edge hardcore punk band, formed in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 2002. The band recorded a demo that was released in 2003. In 2004, they released the \"What Counts\" EP (Think Fast! Records), with their debut full-length, \"The Things We Carry\" (Bridge Nine Records) arriving in 2006. Their latest full-length, \"Songs To Scream At The Sun\" (Bridge Nine Records), has garnered much critical acclaim from hardcore critics and fans alike, winning \\'album of the year\\' from many Hardcore-oriented websites. \\n\\nHave Heart\\'s lyrics cover a variety of subjects from the hardcore scene to a much larger scale. Many topics include self-image and its transition to popular media, the straight edge lifestyle, self-control and respect, pacifism, pressure (especially youth pressure), perseverance, self-destruction, friendship, and family. Such lyrical themes have allowed Have Heart to have a commanding force in at least the positive hardcore scene, and even the scene as a whole.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nPart of the resurgent Boston hardcore scene, Have Heart formed in 2002 around the core lineup of singer Patrick Flynn, guitarist Ryan Hudon, and bassist Ryan Briggs. Hailing from the coastal town of New Bedford, the trio moved to Boston after graduating high school. Initially working with a revolving lineup of local musicians, the band played their first show in July 2003, and in November, their debut demo was released. The demo came to the attention of Think Fast! Records, who signed them for the release of the \"What Counts\" EP in 2004. The EP showcased long-time guitarist Ben Kelly and drummer Justin Paling.\\n\\nIn 2005, Have Heart moved to the estimable hardcore indie Bridge Nine Records and underwent a lineup change, with Kelly and Paling replaced by Kei Yasui and Shawn Costa, respectively. The following year they released \"The Things We Carry\", their first full length. In 2007, the band toured through the U.S., Canada and Europe. \\n\\nIn 2008, the band released their second full-length album on Bridge Nine, \"Songs to Scream at the Sun\", which debuted and peaked at No.\\xa0193 on the Billboard top 200 and No.\\xa016 on the Top Heatseekers chart.\\n\\nSection::::2009: Disbandment.\\nOn May 13, 2009, vocalist Patrick Flynn told the world that Have Heart was breaking up after they completed their scheduled world tour, posting a bulletin on the group\\'s Myspace account:\\n\\n\"Once the Fall rolls around, we can\\'t really do this band the way we would prefer to anymore. Knowing this deadline of ours and having a whole world tour already booked, we\\'d like to take advantage of the chance to say goodbye to all the people we have met around the world over the years.\\n\\nSo, please come check us out in the remaining months on our little trip around the globe. So far Asia has been a wonderful experience and we\\'re very happy to have had the chance to meet so many kind people and look forward to the rest of Asia.\\n\\nWe will be playing our last show on this year\\'s National Edge Day on October 17, 2009 with a bunch of our friends bands and a sweet guest. It will be somewhere T accessible in the Boston area. It will also be a benefit for a women\\'s shelter in New Bedford, MA, run by my kind mother.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a nice 7 years and we\\'d like to thank all the unique hardcore kids and bands we have encountered. We have met so many wonderful people who we\\'ll just never forget.\\n\\nIt\\'s been so great. Take care and hope to see you over the next couple months.\"\\n\\nThe bulletin received over 400 comments from fans after it was posted.\\nOn May 13, Have Heart announced that after finishing their world tour and doing a final show on October 17, 2009 for National Edge Day in Massachusetts, they will split. Their final tour with support from Shipwreck covered every major continent. However, due to a family crisis, Flynn was absent during the first week of shows on the European tour. In this time, Sam Yarmuth from Triple B Records filled in for Flynn, and he rejoined the tour on July 3 in Wiesbaden, Germany. On July 25, 2009, Pat Flynn told the audience during their set on Moshvalleyfest in Belgium that they might release a last EP later that year, though this plan was later scratched. A day later on July 26, they played Fluff Fest in Czechia.\\n\\nBridge Nine Records posthumously released a live recording of Have Heart\\'s final show, titled \"10.17.09\", on November 23, 2010. The release features, in one package, the performance on both CD and DVD. Included with \"10.17.09\" was a pamphlet announcing \"We Were Supposed To Stay Young\", an upcoming DVD chronicling the band\\'s career and general scene of the time. Named after lyrics from Minor Threat\\'s \"Betray\", the DVD is set to be released at some point in 2012.\\n\\nHave Heart\\'s final show was played on National Edge Day 2009 in Revere, Massachusetts, along with other straight edge bands. Many members of bands presented testimonies of how members from Have Heart had a huge influence on their lives and careers, along with presenting stories of good times shared with members of Have Heart. Have Heart\\'s last performance consisted of songs from all three of their releases and went for roughly one hour. Fans responded strongly, with some even using boogie boards for stage diving. The last song they played was \"Watch Me Rise\" from \"The Things We Carry\". Afterwards, Flynn laid out on the stage and a good majority of the crowd surrounded him onstage cheering and chanting, \"Have Heart,\" along with fans shouting their personal testimonies to the significance Have Heart had on their lives. This lasted for around 20 minutes straight. Patrick Flynn estimated approximately 1500 people attended, whilst Bridge Nine estimated around 2000.\\n\\nSection::::2010-2014: Post-breakup.\\nFollowing the disbandment of Have Heart, Patrick Flynn began working as a history teacher but he and the other members remained active in their local scenes. Flynn and Costa, along with members of Dropdead, Fucking Invinsible, and Voices Forming Weapons, formed the band Sweet Jesus in 2010. Flynn and Stemper formed the straight edge band Clear and released a demo in 2011. Flynn, Costa and members of Basement formed the group Fiddlehead and released their first demo in 2014.\\n\\nSection::::2015-present: Free and reunion tour.\\nIn 2015, four of the final five members of Have Heart – Patrick Flynn, Kei Yasui, Shawn Costa, and Ryan Hudon – in addition to the band\\'s 2009 touring guitarist, Austin Stemper – formed the band \"Free\". Who released a four-track, self-titled demo recorded by Trevor Vaughan (Sex Positions, Soul Control) in their home of New Bedford, MA on November 29, 2015, followed by another EP titled \"Ex Tenebris\" on May 15, 2017, which also consisted of four songs, recorded by Will Killingsworth at Dead Air Studios. Flynn stated that although they kept the last lineup and same creative process, they changed the band\\'s name in order to not take \"the spotlight\" away from younger hardcore bands.\\n\\nIn February 2019, the line-up of Free announced they would be playing four shows under the name \"Have Heart\" in Leeds, Boston, Los Angeles and Cologne in July 2019. To promote a sale in their webstore and to celebrate the return of Have Heart, Bridge 9 pressed the previously unreleased track from the \"Songs to Scream at the Sun\" sessions titled \"Lions and Lambs\" as a stand-alone limited-edition 7\" single in March 2019. The single was also uploaded to most streaming services.\\n\\nSection::::Acclaim.\\nHave Heart has garnered many favorable reviews for their albums from many sites such as Sputnikmusic and Punknews. \"Songs To Scream At The Sun\" gained a 4.0 (excellent) from Sputnikmusic, and a 4/5 stars from Punknews, and later on was given the No.\\xa011 spot as album of the year for 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Influences.\\nPatrick Flynn has cited numerous influences from their local hardcore scene.

It lies on the north shore of the entrance to the Cromarty Firth.\\n\\nSection::::Nigg Old Church.\\nThe present parish church is an 18th-century building on an early Christian site dating back to at least the 8th century. The Nigg Stone, one of the most elaborate stone monuments of early medieval western Europe, is preserved in a room at the west end of the church. This late 8th century Pictish cross-slab formerly stood in the churchyard, but was moved indoors for preservation in recent years.\\n\\nThe nearby manse is one of the oldest to survive in Scotland, dating back to the first half of the 17th century. It is now privately owned and no longer used as the parish minister\\'s residence.\\n\\nNigg Old has its odd and curious features. In the churchyard is the Cholera Stone, dating from the cholera epidemic of 1832. One of the elders, on coming out of the church, saw a cloud of vapour hovering above the ground. He believed it to be a cloud of cholera, threw a blanket or cloth over it and placed this large stone on top to keep it from escaping. And inside the church, according to one tradition, the beadle (church officer) allowed an illicit still to be kept in the space under the pulpit.\\n\\nSection::::Oil Fabrication Yard.\\nNigg is the site of a crude oil storage and processing depot for oil piped in from the Beatrice oil field in the Moray Firth and of a major multi user energy park including a dry dock operated by Global Energy Group.\\n\\nIn the oil boom of the 1970s the oil fabrication yard at Nigg was extremely busy with many of the skilled workers moving up from areas such as Glasgow. This resulted in what was called as Glasgow colonies in towns such as Invergordon and Alness with many of the families choosing to make the move permanent. This can be seen as even now with some of residents still possessing a Glaswegian accent.\\n\\nSince the purchase of the fabrication yard by Global Energy Group in 2011 and with investment from the Scottish Government the area has begun to see a new influx of workers to the area again with the yard having plenty of work in the renewable energy sector and also in oil drilling rig refurbishment. In 2012 Global Energy Group set up a skills academy to create new jobs for local residents and young people and this has resulted in a fall in unemployment in the area and a welcome boost to the local economy. The extra work at Nigg has also seen an increase in work at the docks in Invergordon.\\n\\nSection::::Ferry service.\\nThe Nigg to Cromarty ferry route is often called \"The King’s Ferry\" – the route taken by King James IV of Scotland when on pilgrimage to the shrine of St Duthac at Tain, doing so at least 18 times in the years between 1493 to 1513.\\n\\nIt is the only ferry service from the Black Isle.

The \"middle chronology\" (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is more commonly accepted in academic literature. For much of the period in question, middle chronology dates can be calculated by adding 64 years to the corresponding short chronology date (e.g. 1728 BC in short chronology corresponds to 1792 in middle chronology).\\n\\nAfter the so-called \"dark age\" between the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, absolute dating becomes less uncertain. While exact dates are still not agreed upon, the 64-year middle/short chronology gap ceases from the beginning of the Third Babylon Dynasty onward.\\n\\nSection::::Early Bronze Age.\\nEstimation of absolute dates becomes possible for the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.\\nFor the first half of the 3rd millennium, only very rough chronological matching of archaeological dates with written records is possible.\\n\\nSection::::Kings of Ebla.\\nThe city-states of Ebla and Mari (in modern Syria) competed for power at this time. Eventually, under Irkab-Damu, Ebla defeated Mari for control of the region just in time to face the rise of Uruk and Akkad. After years of back and forth, Ebla was destroyed by the Akkadian Empire. Pottery seals of the Egyptian pharaoh Pepi I have been found in the wreckage of the city.\\n\\nLugal-zage-si of Umma rules from Uruk after defeating Lagash, eventually falling to the emerging Akkadian Empire.\\n\\nSince Akkad (or Agade), the capital of the Akkadian Empire, has not yet been found, available chronological data comes from outlying locations like Ebla, Tell Brak, Nippur, Susa and Tell Leilan. Clearly, the expansion of Akkad came under the rules of Sargon and Naram-sin. Its last king, Shar-kali-sharri barely held the empire together, but upon his death, it fragmented. Finally, the city of Akkad itself was destroyed by the Guti.\\n\\nFirst appearing in the area during the reign of Sargon of Akkad, the Guti became a regional power after the decline of the Akkadian Empire following Shar-kali-sharri. The dynasty ends with the defeat of the last king, Tirigan, by Uruk.\\n\\nSection::::Sumer.\\nOnly a handful of the Guti kings are attested to by inscriptions, aside from the Sumerian king list.\\n\\nFollowing the collapse of the Akkadian Empire after Shar-kali-sharri of Akkad under pressure from the invading Gutians, Lagash gradually regained prominence. As a client state to the Gutian Kings, Lagash was extremely successful, peaking under the rule of Gudea. After the last Gutian king, Tirigan, was defeated, by Utu-hengal, Lagash came under the control of Ur under Ur-Namma. Note that there is some indication that the order of the last two rulers of Lagash should be reversed.\\n\\nUniting various Sumerian city-states, Utu-hengal frees the\\nregion from the Gutians. Note that the Sumerian king list records a preceding 4th Dynasty of Uruk which is as\\nyet unattested.\\n\\nIn an apparently peaceful transition, Ur came to power after the end of the reign of Utu-hengal of Uruk, with the first king, Ur-Namma, solidifying his power with the defeat of Lagash. By the dynasty\\'s end with the destruction of Ur by Elamites and Shimashki, the dynasty included little more than the area around Ur.\\n\\nSection::::Middle Bronze Age.\\nThe Old Assyrian / Old Babylonian period (20th to 15th centuries)\\n\\nAfter Ishbi-Erra of Isin breaks away from the declining Third Dynasty of Ur under Ibbi-Suen, Isin reaches its peak under Ishme-Dagan. Weakened by attacks from the upstart Babylonians, Isin eventually falls to its rival Larsa under Rim-Sin I.\\n\\nThe chronology of the Kingdom of Larsa is based mainly on the Larsa King List (Larsa Dynastic List), the Larsa Date Lists, and a number of royal inscriptions and commercial records. The Larsa King List was compiled in Babylon during the reign of Hammurabi, conqueror of Larsa. It is suspected that the list elevated the first several Amorite Isinite governors of Larsa to kingship so as to legitimize the rule of the Amorite Babylonians over Larsa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, Larsa briefly breaks free in a revolt ended by the death of the last king, Rim-Sin II.\\n\\nFollowing the fall of the Ur III Dynasty, the resultant power vacuum was contested by Isin and Larsa, with Babylon and Assyria later joining the fray. In the second half of the reign of Hammurabi, Babylon became the preeminent power, a position it largely maintained until the sack by Mursili I in 1531 BC. Note that there are no contemporary accounts of the sack of Babylon. It is inferred from much later documents.\\n\\nWhen the names of Sealand Dynasty kings were found on cuneiform records like the Babylonian Kings Lists, Chronicle 20, Chronicle of the Early Kings, and the Synchronistic King List, it was assumed that the dynasty slotted in between the First Dynasty of Babylon and the Kassites. Later discoveries changed this to the assumption that the dynasty ran entirely in parallel to the others. Modern scholarship has made it clear that the Sealand Dynasty did in fact control Babylon and the remnants of its empire for a time after its sack by the Hittites in 1531 BC.\\n\\nThe absolute chronology of the Hittite Old Kingdom hinges entirely on the date of the sack of Babylon. In 1531 BC, for reasons that are still extremely unclear, Mursili I marched roughly 500 miles from Aleppo to Babylon, sacked it, and then promptly returned home, never to return. Other than that event, all the available chronological synchronisms are local to the region in and near Anatolia.\\n\\nSection::::Late Bronze Age.\\nThe Middle Assyrian period (14th to 12th centuries)\\n\\n\\nThe Kassites first appeared during the reign of Samsu-iluna of the First Babylonian Dynasty and after being defeated by Babylon, moved to control the city-state of Mari. Some undetermined amount of time after the fall of Babylon, the Kassites established a new Babylonian dynasty. The Babylonian king list identifies 36 kings reigning 576 years, however, only about 18 names are legible. A few more were identified by inscriptions. There is some confusion in the middle part of the dynasty because of conflicts between the Synchronistic Chronicle and Chronicle P. The later kings are well attested from \"kudurru\" steles. Relative dating is from sychronisms with Egypt, Assyria and the Hittites. The dynasty ends with the defeat of Enlil-nadin-ahi by Elam.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps because the capital of Mitanni, Washukanni, has not yet been found, there are no available king lists, year lists, or royal inscriptions. Fortunately, a fair amount of diplomatic, Hittite, and Assyrian sources exist to firm up the chronology. Having become powerful under Shaushtatar, Mitanni eventually falls into the traditional trap of dynasties, the contest for succession. Tushratta and Artatama II both claim the kingship and the Hittites and Assyrians take advantage of the situation. After that, Mitanni was no longer a factor in the region.\\n\\n\\nLong a minor player, after the defeat of its neighbor Mitanni by the Hittites, Assyria rises to the ranks of a major power under Ashur-uballit I. The period is marked by conflict with rivals Babylon and the Hittites as well as diplomatic exchanges with Egypt, in the Amarna letters. Note that after the excavation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of various Neo-Assyrian documents, such as the Assyrian king list, scholars assumed that the chronological data for earlier Assyrian periods could be taken as accurate history. That view has changed over the years and the early Assyrian chronology is being re-assessed. Since there is yet no consensus, the traditional order and regnal lengths will be followed.\\n\\n\\nBeginning under his father, Suppiluliuma I brought the Hittites from obscurity into an empire that lasts for almost 150 years. The Hittite New Kingdom reaches its height after the defeat of Mitanni, an event which ironically leads to the rise of Assyria. The dynasty ends with the destruction of Hattusa by parties undetermined but which may have included the Sea People and the Kaskians.\\n\\n\\nA client state of Mitanni and later the Hittites, Ugarit was nonetheless a significant player in the region. While regnal lengths and an absolute chronology for Ugarit are not yet available, the known order of kings and some firm synchronisms make it reasonably placeable in time. The fall of Ugarit has been narrowed down to the range from the reign of Pharaoh Merneptah to the 8th year of Pharaoh Rameses III of Egypt. This is roughly the same time that Hattusa is destroyed.\\n\\nSection::::Iron Age.\\nThe Early Iron Age (12th to 7th centuries BC). While not subject to the long versus short dating issue, chronology in the Ancient Near East is not on a firm footing until the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian rulers in their respective regions. The dates, regnal lengths, and even the names of a number of rulers from that interim period are still unknown. To make matters worse, the few surviving records, such as the Synchronistic Chronicle, give conflicting data.\\n\\n\\nAfter the fall of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon to Elam, power\\nin the region, and control of Babylon, swung to the city-state of Isin. Assyria at this time was extremely weak, except during the reign of the powerful Assyrian ruler Tiglath-Pileser I. Other polities in the area had yet to recover from the Bronze Age collapse.\\n\\n\\nAfter the Middle Assyrian Kingdom there is an uncertain period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed synchronisms with Egypt in the previous period.\\n\\n\\nDynasties V to IX of Babylon (post-Kassite):\\n\\n\\nThe Assyrian empire rises to become the dominant power in the ancient Near East for over two centuries.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the \"Six-Six Fleet\" expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I.\\n\\n\"Iwate\" was first used as a training ship in 1916 and remained in that role for most of the rest of her career. Her sister, \"Izumo\", was mostly used for training during the 1920s, but became flagship of the IJN forces in China in 1932. She was involved in the Shanghai Incident that year and in the Second Sino-Japanese War that began five years later. The ship was used in the early stages of the Philippines Campaign during the Pacific War until she struck a mine at the end of 1941. \"Izumo\" joined her sister as a training ship in home waters in 1943. Both ships were sunk in a series of American air attacks on the naval base at Kure in July 1945. Their wrecks were refloated after the war and scrapped.\\n\\nSection::::Background and design.\\nJapan initiated the 1896 Naval Expansion Plan after the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The plan included four armored cruisers and four battleships, all of which had to be ordered from foreign shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the \"Six-Six Fleet\". These ships were purchased using the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. Unlike most of their contemporaries, which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, the \"Izumo\" class was intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.\\n\\nConstruction of the \"Izumo\"-class ships was awarded to the British shipbuilder Armstrong Whitworth of Elswick, the same shipyard that had built the earlier two armored cruisers of the \"Six-Six Fleet\". They were also designed by Sir Philip Watts, who took advantage of rapidly advancing boiler technology to substitute lighter Belleville boilers in lieu of the cylindrical boilers of the earlier ships and used the weight saved to increase the thickness of the protective deck and improve the hull structure. The increased number of boilers required an extra funnel, which became the primary means of distinguishing between the two classes.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\nThe \"Izumo\"-class ships were long overall and between perpendiculars. They had a beam of and had an average draft of . The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. They had metacentric heights of . Their crew consisted of 672 officers and enlisted men.\\n\\nThe ships had two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of . The sisters had a designed speed of and both exceeded it by at least a during their sea trials from . They carried up to of coal and could steam for at a speed of .\\n\\nSection::::Armament.\\nThe main armament for all of the \"Six-Six Fleet\" armored cruisers was four Armstrong Whitworth-built 45-caliber eight-inch guns in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The electrically operated turrets were capable of 130° rotation left and right, and the guns could be elevated to +30° and depressed to −5°. Each turret accommodated 65 shells, but could only be reloaded through doors in the turret floor and the ship\\'s deck that allowed the electric winch in the turret to hoist shells up from the shell room deep in the hull. The guns were manually loaded and had a rate of fire about 1.2 rounds per minute. The 203-millimeter gun fired armor-piercing (AP) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of to a range of .\\nThe secondary armament consisted of fourteen Elswick Ordnance Company \"Pattern Z\" quick-firing (QF), 40-caliber, guns. All but four of these guns were mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks, and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Their AP shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of . The ships were also equipped with a dozen 40-caliber QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns and eight QF 2.5-pounder Yamauchi guns as close-range defense against torpedo boats. The former gun fired , projectiles at a muzzle velocity of .\\n\\nThe \"Izumo\"-class ships were equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. The Type 30 torpedo had a warhead and three range/speed settings: at , at or at .\\n\\nSection::::Protection.\\nAll of the \"Six-Six Fleet\" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences, one of which was that the four later ships all used Krupp cemented armor. The waterline belt ran the full length of the ships and its thickness varied from amidships to at the bow and stern. The thickest part of the belt covered the middle of the ship for a length of . It had a height of , of which was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended from the forward to the rear barbette. The \"Izumo\" class had oblique 5-inch armored bulkhead that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.\\n\\nThe barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by of armor. The deck was thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was in thickness. The ships had 30 watertight compartments in their double bottom and an additional 136 or 137 between the bottom and the upper deck.\\n\\nSection::::Service.\\nSection::::Russo-Japanese War.\\nThe sisters spent most of the Russo-Japanese War as flagships together in the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet; \"Iwate\" for the divisional commander, Rear Admiral Misu Sotarō, and \"Izumo\" for the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. \"Iwate\" was moderately damaged by the Russians, but \"Izumo\" only slightly.\\nIn April 1904, the division was tasked to contain the Russian armored cruisers based at Vladivostok, but failed to do so until 13 August when the latter tried to rendezvous with the ships that attempted to breakout from Port Arthur. Unbeknownst to the Russians, Tōgō had defeated the ships from Port Arthur during the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August and the Russian squadron from Vladivostok was intercepted off Ulsan, Korea by the 2nd Division. The steering of the Russian cruiser was damaged early in the battle and the Russians made several attempts to prevent the Japanese from concentrating fire on her, but were ultimately forced to abandon her to her fate. Kamimura left \"Rurik\" to the tender ministrations of his reinforcements and pursued the two remaining Russian ships for a time before breaking off pursuit prematurely based on an incorrect report that \"Izumo\" had expended most of her ammunition. That ship was hit over 20 times, but suffered fewer than 20 men killed or wounded. \"Iwate\", in contrast, was hit far fewer times, but one of them started a major ammunition fire that killed or wounded dozens of men. After the battle, the sisters were refitted and assigned to different units, escorting troop convoys to northern Korea, providing cover while a minefield was laid off Vladivostok, and blockading the Tsugaru Strait until the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan in mid-1905.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of Tsushima.\\nThe Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons were spotted on the morning on 27 May 1904 and Tōgō ordered his ships to put to sea. \"Izumo\" and \"Iwate\" had rejoined the 2nd Division in anticipation of this battle and Kamimura\\'s ships confirmed the initial spotting later that morning before joining Tōgō\\'s battleships. Together with most of the Japanese battleships, the division opened fire at 14:10 on the Russian battleship , which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. After a failed torpedo attack was repulsed by \"Iwate\" and several other cruisers around the same time, the Russian battleship suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at short range. Kamimura\\'s ships engaged her for five minutes before she disappeared back into the mists. Later in the day, Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers around 17:30. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and encountered the Russian battleline about a half hour later. He stayed at long range and his ships fired when practicable before ceasing fire at 19:30.\\nThe surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire and stayed beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range. Well after Nebogatov\\'s surrender, the coast defense ship was spotted well south of Nebogatov\\'s ships and \"Iwate\" and the armored cruiser, , were tasked to pursue her. The Japanese ships demanded that the Russians surrender when they came within range, but her captain refused. \"Admiral Ushakov\" attempted to close the range to bring the Japanese cruisers within range of her guns, but they were fast enough to keep the range open and the Russian ship could not hit either of them. After about half an hour, \"Admiral Ushakov\" had been heavily damaged to bear and her commander ordered his crew to abandon ship and the scuttling charges detonated. Both \"Iwate\" and \"Izumo\" were struck several times during the battle, but neither was significantly damaged and casualties were light. After the battle, the division covered amphibious landings in northeastern Korea in July and August before the war ended.\\n\\nSection::::Subsequent service.\\n\"Izumo\" was ordered to patrol the west coast of Mexico to safeguard Japanese interests and nationals during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when Japan declared war on the German Empire on 23 August 1914. She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America. The ship assisted the armored cruiser in early 1915, when she struck a rock off Baja California. In 1917, \"Izumo\" became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. After the war, she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex-German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan.\\n\\n\"Iwate\" played a minor role in the war, participating in the Battle of Tsingtao before sailing to the South Sea Islands to search for German commerce raiders. The ship began the first of her many training cruises for naval cadets of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1916, a task that would last until the end of 1939. \"Izumo\" began making training voyages of her own during the 1920s.\\nIn 1924, four of the ships\\' 12-pounder guns were removed, as were all of their QF 2.5-pounder guns, and a single 40-caliber 8\\xa0cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added. The gun had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a 3-inch, projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum height of . Refitted again in 1930–31, their torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6-inch guns and their casemates plated over; they now carried only four 12-pounders. At that time, \"Iwate\" also had her boilers replaced by six water-tube boilers, but \"Izumo\" was not reboilered until 1935. The new boilers produced less steam which limited engine power to and reduced their top speed to .\\n\\nSection::::China service and World War II.\\nIn 1932, during the First Shanghai Incident, \"Izumo\" became the flagship of the newly re-established 3rd Fleet that garrisoned Japanese-occupied China. Two years later, she was equipped to operate a floatplane at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ship participated in the Battle of Shanghai in mid-1937 during which she provided naval gunfire support to Japanese troops ashore.\\n\\nStill in Shanghai at the beginning of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941, \"Izumo\" captured the American river gunboat and assisted in sinking the British river gunboat . On 31 December, the cruiser struck a mine in the Lingayen Gulf while supporting Japanese forces during the Philippines Campaign. During this period, \"Iwate\" was still serving as a training ship in home waters. The sisters were briefly re-classified as 1st-class cruisers on 1 July 1942 before they became training ships in 1943. \"Izumo\" returned to Japan late that year and joined her sister in training naval cadets.\\n\\nIn early 1945, the sisters were rearmed when their 8-inch guns were replaced by four Type 89 dual-purpose guns in two twin mounts and four of their remaining 6-inch guns were removed. When firing at surface targets, the Type 89 gun had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at an elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around 8 rounds per minute. Their light anti-aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of 9 (\"Iwate\") and 14 (\"Izumo\") license-built Hotchkiss 25-millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in single, double and triple mounts and two 13.2-millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in single mounts. The weapon was the standard Japanese light anti-aircraft gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. The twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast. The weapon had a maximum range of , but effective range was only about .\\n\\nThe sisters were attacked, but not hit, during the American aerial attack on Kure in July 1945. However, the shockwaves from near misses caused extensive flooding in both ships. \"Iwate\" sank in shallow water on 25 July and \"Izumo\" capsized three days later. Both ships were removed from the navy list on 20 November and their wrecks were raised and scrapped in 1946–47.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Izumo-class cruiser', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11540257'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11542610', 'text': \"Chester W.

It is a combination of ancient Sanskrit theatre with elements of Koothu, a Tamil/Malayalam performing art which is as old as Sangam era. It is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\\n\\nSection::::Origin.\\nKoothu (കൂത്തു് கூத்து) means dance or performance in Malayalam and Tamil. \\nKoodiyattam (kutiyattam), meaning \"combined acting\" as it combines dramas in Sanskrit theatre with elements of traditional Koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as \"Koothambalams\" of Kerala. It is the only surviving artform that uses dramas from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has an attested history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origin and evolution are shrouded in mystery. Koodiyattam and chakyar koothu were among the dramatized dance worship services in temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and chakyar koothu originates from ancient south Indian artform Koothu which is mentioned several times in ancient sangam literature of south and also in the epigraphs belonging to subsequent Pallava, Chera, Chola periods. Inscriptions related to the dramatized dance worship services known as Koothu are available in temples at Tanjore, Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, Tiruvarur, and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services alongside the singing of tevaram and prabandam hymns. There are mentions in epigraphs those forms of Koothu that are called \"aariyam\" when they use languages other than Tamil such as Sanskrit, Pali or Prakrit for plays.\\n\\nSeveral ancient kings and members of other professions are listed to have authored several works for these services. There is evidence of these services being done all over ancient subcontinent during time of cholas and pallavas. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring a play called \"kailasodharanam\" in Tamil that has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva\\'s anger and being subdued mercilessly for the same. For examples a fragmented inscription at the door step of an ancient Shiva temple (now non-existent) in Pegan in Burma finds mention of these services.\\n\\nIt is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of Chera dynasty, who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern Kodungallur), reformed Koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring presentation of the play to well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, \"Subhadraharana\" and \"Tapatisamvarana\" and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a Brahmin friend called Tolan. These plays are still presented on stage. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include Ascaryacudamani of Saktibhadra, Kalyanasaugandhika of Nilakantha, Bhagavadajjuka of Bodhayana, \"Nagananda of Harsa\", and many plays ascribed to Bhasa including Abhiseka and Pratima. The Kutiyattam performance was performed in specially designed temples called koothambalams.\\n\\nThe use of Buddhist themes for plays is a very controversial and moot issue and seem to be a later interpolation not existing since ancient times for the latter not being a then-legal vedic system.\\n\\nSection::::Instruments used.\\nTraditionally, the main musical instruments used in Koodiyattam are mizhavu, kuzhitalam, edakka, kurumkuzhal, and sankhu. Mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas Nambiar caste, accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).\\n\\nSection::::Performance style.\\nTraditionally, Koodiyattam has been performed by Chakyars (a subcaste of Kerala Hindus) and by Nangyaramma (women of the Ambalavasi Nambiar caste). The name Koodiyattam, meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence or more actors on stage who act in consonance with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.\\n\\nThe main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic Koothu and Koodiyattam inside the temple or in the Koothambalam. Chakyar women, Illotammas, are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are lengthy and elaborate affairs, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the \"purappadu\" where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the \"nirvahanam\" where the actor, using abhinaya, brings to the audience the mood of the main character of the play. The \"nirvahanam\", a retrospective, takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is \"koodiyattam\" which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, Koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.\\n\\nThe practice was that elders of the Chakyar community taught it to their youngsters and it was an art form performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955 Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time. For performing the art forms outside the temples he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community. In his own words:\\n\\nIn 1962, under the leadership of Dr. V. Raghavan, noted art and Sanskrit scholar, Sanskrit Ranga of Madras, invited Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar to perform Kutiyattam in Chennai. Thus for the first time in history Kutiyattam was performed outside Kerala. They presented at Madras on three nights: Kutiyattam scenes from three plays \"Abhiṣeka\",\"Subhadrādhanañjaya\" and \"Nāgānda\".\\n\\nIn early 1960s Maria Christoffer Byrski, a Polish student doing research in Indian theatres at Banaras Hindu University came to study Kootiyattam with Mani Madhava Chakyar and became the first non-Chakyar/nambiar to learn the art form. He stayed in Guru\\'s home at Killikkurussimangalam and studied the art form in traditional Gurukula way.\\n\\n\\nSection::::A dying art form.\\nKoodiyattam has traditionally been an exclusive art form performed in special venues called \"koothambalams\" in Hindu temples and access to these performances were highly restricted to only caste Hindus. Also, performances are lengthy taking up to forty \\ndays to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala led to a curtailment in the patronage extended to Koodiyattam artistes and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a severe crisis in the profession. UNESCO has called for the creation of a network of Koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to nurture the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it. The Margi Theatre Group in Thiruvananthapuram is a notable organisation dedicated to the revival of Kathakali and Koodiyattom in Kerala. Also Nepathya is an exclusive institution to promote Koodiyattam and related art forms working at Moozhikkulam. The Sangeet Natak Akademi, India\\'s National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest award for performing artists, to Kutiyattam artists like, Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri (2007), Painkulam Raman Chakyar (2010) and Painkulam Damodara Chakyar (2012).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Koodiyattam', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154786'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1154887', 'text': 'Canguçu\\n\\nCanguçu (population: 55,956) is a city in Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil.

Ryan was a long-standing staff member of Goodson-Todman Productions and Mark Goodson Productions, where he created the concept for the game show \"Blockbusters\". Ryan also created the rebus puzzles for the game show \"Classic Concentration\". He was also a writer and creator of puzzles for the game shows \"Body Language\", \"Catch Phrase\", \"Password Plus\" and \"Trivia Trap\".\\n\\nAs senior games executive at Goodson\\'s lottery division, Steve created games with million-dollar payoffs for many state and international lottery game shows including: \"The Big Spin\" for California, \"Bingo-Lotto\" for Lithuania Lottery, \"Bonus Bonanza\" for Massachusetts Lottery, \"A Chance de Ouro\" for Brazil Lottery, \"Flamingo Fortune\" for Florida Lottery, \"Illinois Luckiest\" for Illinois Lottery, \"Instant Riches\" for Illinois Lottery, \"New York Wired\" for New York Lottery, \"\" for Multi-State Lottery, \"Second Chance Sweepstakes\" for Ohio Lottery, \"Telelotto\" for Estonia Lottery, \"Win\\'n Spin\" for South Africa Lottery, \"Zama Zama\" for South Africa Lottery, and \"25th Anniversary Game Show\" for Pennsylvania Lottery.

He began his career as a puzzle columnist at Copley News Service where he created several puzzle and game features for readers across America and other English speaking countries. Those features include “Puzzles & Posers” which is a mixed grill of cerebral calisthenics designed to explore player\\'s powers of reason, logic and ingenuity, and “Zig-Zag” the original word maze-puzzle which challenges players to search for words from given categories. Both features have run non-stop from 1973 and 1975 (respectively) to current day. Both of Ryan\\'s features have the distinction of being Copley News Service\\'s longest running features in the history of the news organization. Creators Syndicate absorbed both features when Copley News Service sold in 2008.\\n\\nDozens of Steve Ryan books have evolved from his puzzle features and his work in television. Steve self-published his first book in 1975 titled “Puzzle Cards.” His “Grape Vine” puzzle in that book is recognized as the earliest known puzzle to utilize what is known as the “freeway rule” within a genre of puzzles known as mazes-with-rules as referenced in SuperMazes by Robert Abbott.\\n\\nWorldwide, many Steve Ryan puzzle books have been translated and published for Chinese, Russian, Czechoslovakian, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Indian, Malaysian and Indonesian markets.\\n\\nRyan is also co-author of \"The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows\", the most comprehensive book of its kind. This encyclopedia is often referred to as the Bible of the game show industry. As a reference book it documents every game show that has ever appeared in a national market whether it be in cable, syndication or network. Three updated editions have been published to date. The book has been used as a \"Jeopardy!\" answer: The answer was, \"\\'Beat the Odds,\\' \\'Music Bingo\\' and \\'Fast Draw\\' are entries in an encyclopedia of these by Schwartz, Ryan & Wostbrock.\" A contestant came in with the correct question, “What are game shows?”\\n\\nIn addition to the books authored by Steve Ryan, his work has appeared in such magazines as \"Games\", \"Nick\", \"Nickelodeon\", \"Nick Toons\" and \"World of Puzzles\" in the U.S. and \"Games & Puzzles\" in the United Kingdom. Will Shortz, while editor at \"Games\" magazine, acknowledged the work of Steve Ryan as some of the best in the world of puzzles.\\n\\nPuzzle creations by Steve Ryan have been utilized by the Game\\'s National Puzzle Test. His puzzles always rate as visually intriguing, with a high rate of contestants attempting to solve, yet with a lower than normal rate of success. That\\'s the secret behind most Steve Ryan creations: visually stimulating and mentally captivating. A basic Steve Ryan philosophy has always been to make a puzzle appear easy to solve, yet quite engaging to conjure the solution.\\n\\nStix & Stones, a box game created by Steve Ryan, received the Parents\\' Choice 2010 Award for new game. After years of challenging fans to solve his brainteasers with pencils, players are asked to put down those pencils and grab a handful of sticks and stones to create images using the fewest possible number of sticks and stones. It\\'s a game that encourages creative thinking with little or no artistic skill required. Ryan likes to say, “If you could play against Pablo Picasso, all you’d have to do is out think him because he has to use the same sticks and stones as you do to create his image.\"\\n\\nAs a child, Ryan was inspired by the mathematical recreations of Henry Dudeney and Sam Loyd.

It is situated on the east bank of the Red River. The community is approximately forty-five miles south of Shreveport on U.S. Highway 71. The population, 2,299 at the 2000 census, is nearly two-thirds African American, most with long family histories in the area. The 2010 census, however, reported 1,964 residents, a decline of 335 persons, or nearly 15 percent during the course of the preceding decade.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nRed River Parish and the Red River Valley were areas of unrest and white paramilitary activity and violence after the Civil War, and especially during the 1870s of Reconstruction. The parish was based on cotton cultivation, dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans who far outnumbered the whites. After the war, white planters and farmers tried to reestablish dominance over a majority of the population. With emancipation and being granted citizenship and suffrage, African Americans tried to create their own lives.\\n\\nFormed in May 1874 from white militias, the White League in Louisiana was increasingly well-organized in rural areas like Red River Parish. It worked to turn out the Democratic Party, as well as suppress freedmen\\'s civil rights and voting rights. It used violence against officeholders, running some out of town and killing others, and acted near elections to suppress black and white Republican voter turnout.\\n\\nIn one of the more flagrant examples of violence, the White League in August 1874 forced six Republicans from office in Coushatta, then assassinated them before they could leave the state. Victims included the brother and three brothers-in-law of the Republican State Senator Marshall H. Twitchell. Twitchell\\'s wife and her brothers were from a family with long ties in Red River Parish. One of Twitchell\\'s several biographies is an unpublished 1969 dissertation at Mississippi State University in Starkville by the historian Jimmy G. Shoalmire, a Shreveport native and a specialist in Reconstruction studies.\\n\\nThe White League also killed five to twenty freedmen who had been escorting the Republicans and were witnesses to the assassinations. The events became known as the Coushatta Massacre and contributed to the Republican governor\\'s requesting more Federal troops from U.S. President U.S. Grant to help control the state. Ordinary Southerners wrote to the White House describing the terrible conditions and fear they lived under during these years.\\n\\nWith increased fraud, violence and intimidation, white Redeemer Democrats gained control of the state legislature in 1876 and established a new system of one-party rule. They passed laws making elections more complicated and a new constitution with provisions that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poorer whites. This disenfranchisement persisted for decades into the 20th century before passage of civil rights legislation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\n\\nAfter World War II, Dr. Lawrence Edward L\\'Herisson, Sr. (1925-1988), a native of Bossier Parish, built a 23-bed regional rural hospital in Coushatta. He subsequently relocated to Shreveport with his wife, the former Mary Sloan (1925-2016). Coushatta is now served by the 25-bed Christus Coushatta Health Care Center.\\n\\nDr. L\\'Herisson\\'s father-in-law, whom he never met, Lawrence Wiley Sloan (1892-1935,) died in an accident during the early attempt to bring electricity to southern Tennessee. The Tennessee Valley Authority, launched in 1933, honored Sloan by designating his then nine-year-old daughter, Mary, to throw the switch that energized the region.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nCoushatta is located at (32.023162, -93.341775).\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.91%) is water.\\n\\nNorth of Coushatta, Loggy Bayou, which flows from Lake Bistineau, joins the Red River.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,299 people, 738 households, and 512 families residing in the town.

The noise awakens Alex\\'s mother, who finds Daniel dead and is approached by the killer.\\n\\nMarie, hearing the mother\\'s screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed.

There\\'s a lot of intelligence in both the script and in Alexandre Aja\\'s direction..For those who enjoy horror films and don\\'t mind copious quantities of red-dyed fluids, this one is not to be missed.

As time passed, BMW M began to supplement BMW\\'s vehicles portfolio with specially modified higher trim models, for which they are now most known by the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include modified engines, transmissions, suspensions, interior trims, aerodynamics, and exterior modifications to set them apart from their counterparts. All M models are tested and tuned at BMW\\'s private facility at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany.\\nBMW M also remains the only performance based company to cater motorcycles at the same time, specifically the BMW S1000RR.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Origins.\\nEstablished in May 1972 with 35 employees, it grew to 400 employees by 1988, and is currently an integral part of BMW\\'s market presence. The first racing project was BMW’s 3.0 CSL.\\n\\nAfter the success of BMW M products like \"BMW 3.0 CSL\" in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for sale to the public. The first official M-badged car for sale to the public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978. The M1, however, was more of a racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver. The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW’s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan.\\n\\nIn 1993 BMW Motorsport GmbH changed their name to BMW M GmbH.\\n\\nBMW Motorsport GmbH supplied the 6.1 litre V12 DOHC 48 valve engine that powers the McLaren F1, which, like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the first year of competition for the GTR racing variant.\\n\\nSection::::Recent history.\\nAt present, BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every BMW nameplate, except for the Z1, 7 Series flagship luxury sedan and the X1 and X3 compact crossover SUVs. There is no BMW M version of the 7 Series, as BMW did not want its flagship saloon to be powered by a high-revving engine, and as the recent top-performing versions (usually the BMW 760Li) have V12 engines which while powerful are considered too heavy for a sporty offshoot. So far the unofficial \"BMW M7\" is the Alpina B7, which is produced on BMW\\'s assembly line though its engine and finishing touches are done by auto tuner Alpina.\\n\\nThe BMW X5 and X6 sport activity vehicles received M derivatives for the 2010 model year onwards. These are the first M vehicles with xDrive four-wheel drive and automatic transmissions, and also the first M-badged SUV models. However, the E70 and E71 X5 and X6 M were actually developed by BMW Group rather than by BMW M.\\n\\nAlthough these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, BMW M has a considerably different philosophy than Mercedes-AMG. BMW M has emphasized tuning only vehicles with \"Lateral agility\" (which has long been the 3 Series, 5 Series, and roadsters), while AMG has created high-performance versions of many of its nameplates, including flagship sedans and SUVs. Accordingly, \"an M car has to be responsive and fundamentally keen on turning as well as accelerating. The M5\\'s technical spec is all about connecting the driver to a car that reacts blindingly fast, whatever request the driver hands down.\" Until the 2010 model year, BMW M has also never used supercharging or turbocharging, unlike Mercedes-AMG or Audi; for instance the E39 and E60 iterations of the BMW M5 (using naturally-aspirated engines) competed against the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (with a supercharged V8) and the Audi RS6 (twin-turbo).\\nBMW M vehicles typically used manuals and semi-automatic transmissions (the most recent type being a dual clutch transmission), in contrast to Mercedes-AMG which largely has automatic transmissions (the 7-speed AMG SpeedShift MCT dual clutch transmission was used on new models from 2009 onward). However, the BMW X5 M and X6 M were the first M-vehicles offered with automatic transmission, a 6-speed Steptronic unit, since this works with xDrive.\\n\\nBMW M engines were traditionally large displacement naturally aspirated high revving engines, particularly the S85 V10 in the E60 M5 and E63 M6 and the related S65 V8 in the E90 M3. These are the most powerful engines BMW has ever built (not including the BMW S70/2) without supercharging or turbocharging, with an output of 100\\xa0hp per liter of displacement, and each has won numerous International Engine of the Year Awards.\\n\\nHowever, the late 2000s international regulations trends on reducing CO2 emissions and fuel consumption are cited as the reasons not to continue further development on naturally aspirated high redline engines. The N54 twin-turbo inline-6 which debuted in the 2007 BMW 335i (E90) gives almost equivalent performance to the E46 and E90 iterations of the BMW M3, while being much more practical and fuel-efficient as a daily driver. Starting with the X5 M and X6 M, and featured in the F10 M5, BMW used the twin-turbocharged S63 which not only produces more horsepower and torque, but is also more efficient than the S85 V10. Also unlike the S85 and S65 which do not share a design with non-M BMW engines, the S63 has significant parts commonality with the base N63 V8 engine (which is also has twin turbochargers) making them less expensive to build. At the present (2012), BMW has not considered supercharging yet.\\n\\nAs of the 2013 model year, the BMW M3 (E92/E93) is the only \"traditional\" M car left, as the rest of the M lineup features turbocharged engines, and the next iteration of the M3 (F80) and M4 (F82/F83) features a twin turbo straight-6 engine.\\n\\nSection::::M-Cars vs. M-badged cars.\\nThere are several BMW models which BMW Motorsport made changes on, without them becoming M-Cars. This succession of styling (M-tech I, M-tech II) and performance cues came from BMW Motorsports; e.g. BMW 530i M packet or 325i \"M packet\" etc.\\n\\nVehicles which have been modified by BMW Motorsport, but are not full \"M Cars\", may feature \"M\" badges, whilst full M Cars will have \"M\" badges with the model number (e.g., \"M4\" or \"M5\"). Two exceptions would be the M Roadster and M Coupe models, both Z3, Z4 and 1 Series variants, which only have an \"M\" badge with no number displayed on the trunk. These cars are full M Cars.\\n\\nIn recent years, there have been \\'M\\'-badged accessories available on BMW\\'s standard fleet as factory options or as part of the \"M Sport\" package (which is more expensive than the optional Sport package). Examples of this include the E39 and E60 5 series sedans which had optional aerodynamic packages that were strongly influenced by the M5\\'s styling (for example, bumpers with larger intakes). It is not unusual to see \"standard\" BMW vehicles with \"M\" badges or ribbons accenting their design. The plain motorsports badge simply stands for the \\'M-tech\\' upgrades equipped on the vehicle (e.g., suspension, brakes, looks or any other modification that has been developed by the M division), therefore the \\'M\\' badge on these vehicles should not be confused with the true \\'M\\' vehicles (except the Z-cars, as mentioned), as they are not fully fledged \\'M\\' cars, just equipped with \\'M\\'-tech upgrades. BMW has offered these \\'M\\' options on their standard vehicles since the late 1970s which explains why these vehicles carry \\'M\\' badges straight from the factory. In comparison, vehicle maker Audi also employs this same type of nomenclature. There are fully fledged \\'S\\' models (S4, S5, S6, S7 and TTS), as well as an optional \"S\\'-line package that can be equipped to their standard vehicle lineup.\\n\\nAn example of \\'M\\'-badged vehicles in recent times include the E60 BMW 550i and E63 BMW 650i. The standard BMW 5 Series and 6 Series only had a choice of either a manual or automatic transmission, but the \\'M\\' Sport package had an optional Sequential Sport Gearbox (SSG) (a gearbox similar to M5 and M6 (SMG) until after the 2007 model year.\\n\\nSection::::M Performance models.\\nRecently (2012) BMW has introduced a new category for \\'M\\' cars, which was branded as the \\'M\\' Performance. They are the first M diesel cars that BMW produces.\\n\\nTo date this includes the M550d in touring and saloon variants, the X6 M50d and X5 M50d which all share a 381\\xa0bhp 740NM triple turbo diesel engine, the former pair are only LHD drive markets currently due to the xDrive layout in the F10 series not being compatible with RHD markets (a RWD F10 M550d was mentioned by Auto Express but has not been confirmed). Official figures put the M550d xDrive’s 0-to-62-mph time at 4.7 seconds and top speed at 155mph (limited).The first petrol M Performance car is the M135i which is a 320\\xa0bhp 1 series car. M135i is available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\\n\\nThe M550d is available in both sedan and touring chassis, with a ZF 8HP eight-speed sport automatic transmission including auto start/stop function. Manual and non-sport automatic gearboxes are not available.\\nUnique features on the M550d are the twin trapezoidal exhausts in dark chrome and both wing mirrors and air-intake bars in ferric grey. Other 5 series models have wing mirrors in the same colour as the rest of the vehicle. The front fog lamps, standard on all other F10/F11 5 series models are removed, to make space for additional air-intakes. The door-sill plates are also unique on this vehicle, having a \"M550d\" inscription. \\nIn addition, the F11 Touring model features air suspension on the rear axle, with automatic self-levelling.\\n\\nNothing yet has been announced as regards the F30 3 Series M Performance line up but BMW have trademarked (amongst many other monikers) M335, M340 and M350. Further to this M President Friedrich Nitschke has confirmed that the new triple turbo diesel engine will \"easily fit\" within the F30 engine bay but did not elaborate any further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Lineup.\\nSection::::M badged cars.\\nAll these cars are true BMW Motorsport models, not M-line sport models that bear BMW Motorsport features such as sport body kits, and interior specs.\\n\\n\\nSection::::M engined cars.\\nIn the late 80s, due to prohibitive taxes for cars above 2.0 liters of engine displacement in Italy and Portugal, BMW decided to build the E30 320is as an alternative to the 2.3 liter M3. This car was equipped with a shorter stroke S14 engine and produced 192 PS. BMW produced a total of 3648 units between 9/1987 and 11/1990 of which a majority of 2542 units were made available in two door form (code name AK95). No catalytic converters were installed on this limited version. The steering rack, springs, shock absorbers, and brakes were similar to the normal E30 6 cylinder models (i.e. 325i) with sports suspension. The engine was mated to a Getrag 265 five-speed gearbox in dog-leg configuration.\\n\\nSection::::Competition.\\nAudi\\'s RS models, Mercedes-Benz\\'s AMG models, and more recently Lexus F model(s), are often reviewed in direct competition to a similarly-sized BMW M car, such as the Lexus IS-F vs. Audi RS4 vs. Mercedes C63 AMG vs. BMW M3.\\n\\nIn contrast to aftermarket tuners, Alpina BMW-based automobiles are currently mostly built by BMW on its production lines and are more comfort-oriented. Alpina is recognized as an automobile manufacturer and works very closely with BMW, sometimes participating in the development of BMW models and engines. Some Alpina models are even sold in North-America by BMW and either compete with the BMW M6 Gran Coupé, in the case of the Alpina B6 Gran Coupé, or replace them, in the case of the Alpina B7 as there is no M7 variant of the 7 Series to compete with the model.\\n\\nBMW M also faces competition from several independent companies offering their own performance versions of BMW models; some performance packs can be retrofitted to existing cars while others are applied to new cars bought directly from BMW AG and converted prior to first registration. Such companies include Hamann Motorsport, Dinan Cars, G-Power, AC Schnitzer and Hartge.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'BMW M', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1158851'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11589054', 'text': 'Rancho Boca de Santa Monica\\n\\nRancho Boca de Santa Monica (mouth of Santa Monica) was a Mexican land grant in present day Los Angeles County, California given by governor Juan Alvarado in 1839 to Ysidro Reyes and Francisco Marquez.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn 1839, Ysidro Reyes (1813–1861) and Francisco Marquez (1798–1850) were granted Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, comprising what is now Santa Monica Canyon, the Pacific Palisades, and parts of Topanga Canyon.\\n\\nFrancisco Marquez and his wife, Roque Valenzuela, built an adobe house in the upper mesa of the canyon.

Even as late as the \"1940s and early 1950s some high British officials still believed that Persian petroleum was actually and rightly British petroleum because it had been discovered by the British, developed by British capital, and exploited through British skill and British ingenuity.\"\\n\\nIn stark contrast, Iranian Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh believed the 1933 concession granted to the AIOC by Iran was \"immoral as well as illegal\". Mosaddeq \"challenged every aspect of the British commercial presence in Iran\". The British feared that if Mosaddeq\\'s policies prevailed, \"nationalists throughout the world could abrogate British concessions with impunity.\"\\n\\nSection::::Nationalization.\\nThe AIOC was nationalized by the Iranian Parliament in March 1951. In Iran this was enormously popular and seen as a long overdue staunching of the bleeding of its national wealth which could now be harnessed to fighting poverty in Iran. In Britain, the nationalisation was widely seen as an intolerable breach of contract or theft. British emissaries in the United States after the nationalisation, argued that allowing Iran to nationalise the oil company \"would be widely regarded as a victory for the Russians\" and would also \"cause a loss of one hundred million pounds per annum in the United Kingdom\\'s balance of payments, thus seriously affecting our rearmament program and our cost of living.\"\\n\\nBritish warships blockaded Abadan. On 22 August, the British cabinet imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran. It prohibited exports of key British commodities, including sugar and steel, directed the withdrawal of all British personnel from Iranian oil fields and all but a hard core of about 300 administrators from Abadan and blocked Iran\\'s access to its hard currency accounts in British banks.\\n\\nAfter the withdrawal of the British workers in the fall of 1951, the Iranians felt confident that they could easily hire non-British technicians to run the industry and then quickly train their own nationals to replace them. Unfortunately, this did not prove to be the case; the United States, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and West Germany all refused to make their technicians available to the nationalized Iranian industry. Only Italy agreed, demonstrating that most industrialized countries supported Britain over Iran in the nationalization dispute.\"\\n\\nIn July 1952, the Royal Navy intercepted the Italian tanker \"Rose Mary\" and forced it into the British protectorate of Aden on the grounds that the ship\\'s petroleum was stolen property. News that the Royal Navy was intercepting tankers carrying Iranian oil scared off other tankers and effectively shut down oil exports from Iran.\\n\\nSupporters of the nationalization, including the National Poet of Iran Adib Boroumand, sent out propaganda in the form of poetry in support of Mossadegh\\'s movement. Poems were read out on radio broadcasts, passed out to people on paper pamphlets, and published in newspapers.\\n\\nSection::::Coup d\\'état.\\nThe democratically elected government of Iran was overthrown on 19 August 1953, following a coup d\\'état orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States, and Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh was ousted from power. During the coup, codenamed Operation Ajax, the CIA and MI6 restored Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. In August 1954, the AIOC was set under the control of an international consortium. Initially, ownership shares in the consortium proposed to be divided along the following lines: 40% to be divided equally (8% each) among the five major American companies; British Petroleum to have a 40% share; Royal Dutch/Shell to have 14%; and CFP, a French Company, to receive 6%. Iran now received 25% of the profits compared to 20% of the original treaty with the AIOC. Saudi-Arabia and other oil-exploiting countries of the region received up to 50% of the profits in cooperation with American oil companies at the same time.\\n\\nIt was only in 1980, after the US and British backed Shah regime was ousted through a people\\'s uprising in 1979, that the oil company was nationalized into what is today known as the NIOC (National Iranian Oil Company).\\n\\n', 'title': 'Abadan Crisis', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1159294'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'eRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11593724', 'text': \"Reuben L.

Col. Ezekiel Cushing purchased the island in 1732 and is credited with being the first European to settle and build a house on the island. He died in 1765, and willed the island to his nine surviving children. Soon after, other settlers arrived to make a livelihood out of farming, fishing, and catching lobsters.\\n\\nDuring World War II, Casco Bay became United States Navy base \"Sail\" for destroyers escorting HX, SC, and ON convoys of the Battle of the Atlantic. Facilities constructed on the island included the Torpedo Control Officers School of the Portland Naval Training Center, a navy supply pier with a naval fuel annex often cited as a source of contamination for both the island\\'s marsh and Casco Bay, and the Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Casco Bay (NAAF) seaplane base operated as part of Naval Air Station Brunswick from 14 May 1943 to 15 December 1946.\\n\\nAfter the war, tourism became the most popular industry, and several small stores, a fire station, and a K-5 school (1953) were built. In the summer, several hundred or even thousands of tourists travel from places such as Massachusetts and New York to vacation in their summer cottages.\\n\\nThe island was originally part of the city of Portland, which re-evaluated property taxes in 1990. Due in part to high real estate prices paid by out-of-state residents and property aesthetic values, property taxes increased substantially. Many residents felt this move created an unfair discrepancy between the money paid to the City of Portland and the services they received in return. The island voted to secede from Portland, and on July 1, 1993, the island was declared the Town of Long Island. The Long Island Historical Society now houses every news article that was printed about the secession movement as well as video and film footage of the secession ceremonies. These archives also include copies of the local and national news coverage given to the community during its \"rebellion\".\\n\\nSection::::Long Island today.\\nLong Island is still a popular destination in the summer, and is a 45-minute ferry ride from Portland. Popular attractions include South Beach (also known as Sandy Beach). The first 2/3 of this beach are state owned. The last third or so is privately owned. Another beach is Fowler\\'s Beach, located on the western end of Long Island, although this is commonly reserved for residents of the island. Popular hiking areas of the island include the town\\'s Conservation Area, often referred to as \"The Area\", and the back shore rocks, located toward the East End.\\n\\nIndependence Day events include a parade of floats, the vehicles of the Volunteer Fire Department, a Mr. and Ms. Town of Long Island election and an award ceremony for the most creative floats.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Long Island, Maine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115942', 'cat_id': '115942', 'cat_title': 'Early_Modern_Ireland', 'cat_pages': '32', 'cat_subcats': '6', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'exhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1159441', 'text': 'Beverley Mahood\\n\\nBeverley Mahood (born 2 November 1974 in Belfast, Northern Ireland) is a country music singer-songwriter and television host in Canada.

The plant used high grade concentrates from the mines at Broken Hill and as they were owned by the same controlling interests these came from the Zinc Corporation and New Broken Hill Consolidated Mines.\\nTo haul the concentrates the New South Wales Government Railways modified 80 G class open wagons by permanently closing the bottom discharge doors to form the GC wagon.

It is in the local government area of the City of Darebin. It is 4 or 5\\xa0km from Melbourne\\'s central business district, just north of Clifton Hill, and a few hundred metres south of the main part of Northcote. Merri Creek forms its western border, and to the east lies Fairfield.\\n\\nWestgarth is part of Northcote for administrative purposes, although it retains its own geographically distinct commercial centre.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nBefore European occupation, the area was home to the Wurundjeri people. Land c.2\\xa0km to the south, where Merri Creek meets the Yarra, was an early site of colonial contact, briefly home to the Native Police Corps in 1842, and a school for Aboriginal children until 1851. Land sales first occurred in the Northcote area in 1840, and land was purchased in the area then known as Northcote-by-the-Merri (now Westgarth) but not immediately developed. Three of the buyers later had streets named after them - Cunningham, Urquhart and Walker. As Northcote, Victoria developed in the mid-to-late 19th century, Northcote-by-the-Merri became known as Northcote South. Land was gazetted for development in 1853, but development was relatively slow. All Saints Anglican church on High Street Westgarth dates to 1860 (present building, 1870), and the Bridge Hotel to 1864.\\n\\nWestgarth\\'s development accelerated - along with that of many other Melbourne suburbs - in the economic boom of the 1880s. As the children of the Gold Rush generation formed their own families, Melbourne\\'s population swelled. The Victorian Parliament reacted by using railway lines to open up new housing areas. The railway line from Clifton Hill to Alphington was opened in 1884, and the railway station was linked to Melbourne via a western loop in 1888. A cable tram line down High Street to Clifton Hill was opened in 1886, faltered after the land market collapse of 1892, and opened and closed again until reopening permanently in 1901. Building continued through the Edwardian era and into the 1920s, and in 1925 the Northcote tram (now route 86) was connected right through to the city centre. The present commercial and shopping strip along High St. dates to the early 20th century, and Westgarth Primary School to 1925, when it opened as Westgarth Central School. The suburb won its present name between 1906 and 1910, with the decision to name the railway station after William Westgarth. The art nouveau Westgarth Theatre, the suburb\\'s best-known landmark, opened in 1920.\\n\\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an influx of southern European immigrants to the area, in common with other City of Darebin suburbs. By the 1970s the Westgarth Theatre catered largely to a Greek-speaking cinema audience. Westgarth school photos and class lists from the 1970s are dominated by Greek names and faces. That influence began to fade in the 1980s, with the arrival of a new generation of Westgarth residents with higher incomes and education levels. The process of gentrification accelerated through the 1990s, fuelled by the suburb\\'s central location, attractive streets and housing stock, and its proximity to pricier inner-city suburbs including Fitzroy, Clifton Hill and North Fitzroy. The Westgarth Theatre became an art-house movie venue in 1986 when the Valhalla Cinema relocated there after the demolition of its original premises in Richmond. Ten years later, it became the Westgarth Cinema, now part of the Palace Group. A number of industrial buildings along High St. were converted to residential use in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century. Westgarth Primary School\\'s original building was demolished in 1990 and replaced by an open-plan building, extended in 2011.\\n\\nSection::::World War II.\\nA partially excavated tunnel and bunker is located in Westgarth on the north bank of Merri Creek about 30 metres downstream from where a trail crosses the stream near the southwest corner of Oldis Gardens and East Street. The tunnel entrance is locked and it is reported that it lies under a high pressure gas pipeline.\\n\\nSection::::Westgarth today.\\nToday, Westgarth retains its southern European presence, with many children of the 1960s and 1970s immigrant wave still living in the area. But Westgarth also houses a wide variety of other cultural and language groups. Gentrification has brought back some of the children of Melbourne residents who moved to middle and outer suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. The area is now known for its local artists, and a lesbian community has also been associated with Westgarth for some years. The best-known local resident is the Australian actor Vince Colosimo.\\n\\nThe Westgarth Cinema remains the centre of the small commercial strip at the southern end of High Street, which is now populated by bohemian fashion outlets, cafes and other retail businesses. The strip remains noticeably less developed than its counterparts in Clifton Hill and Fairfield, arguably due in part to the traffic intensity of the relatively narrow High Street. New development has been rare, although new businesses open every few months and apartments above shops were constructed in 2009 and again in 2011. The lack of local shops means most Westgarth residents currently travel to other suburbs for groceries and many other needs. Retaining the \"village\" feel of Westgarth, against mounting commercial pressures to redevelop Victorian heritage buildings and development sites, was the aim of the now-defunct \"Save Westgarth Village\" campaign.\\n\\nThe Westgarth Cinema was one of the last two remaining single-screen venues in Melbourne, until being redeveloped in 2006. After several years of uncertainty about its commercial survival, the family owners finally sold it to Palace Cinemas in 2005, while retaining ownership of the building. Although many original features have been preserved, it is now a popular multiplex with a 300-seat cinema downstairs and now four smaller cinemas upstairs.\\n\\nThe train line through Westgarth station is now part of the Hurstbridge line, following an easterly route into the city. A second, proximate station on the Mernda line, Rushall, is accessed via a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Merri Creek (the bridge connects through to an east-west cycle route along Linear Park, one of the nicest such parks in Melbourne). The High Street tram line is now part of Melbourne tram route 86. Upgrading the tram line occurred in 2011, with three stops reduced to two in Westgarth and increased dangers to cyclists and pedestrians close to the relocated central stop. The tram changes are noted in Council consultation and in many media articles and community campaigns. In August 2013, in the last phase of the tram works, metal sculptures designed by Syrinx Environmental were added to the new median strip, producing a local outcry on social media and featuring in the national press. The Council voted to remove them again after 3 weeks.\\n\\nThe Jika Jika Community centre on Plant Street is the main meeting place for local events and activities.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nWestgarth Primary School is the area\\'s main school, although Merri Creek, Fairfield and Spensley Street Schools are closer by distance for many Westgarth residents. Westgarth Primary was founded in 1924 as Westgarth Central School, Number 4177 in the Victorian system. Originally Primary to Year 8, it eventually became primary-only. It now caters to approximately 650 students in grades from preparatory to year six. It has two campuses, Clarke St (for Grade 3-6 students), and Brooke St (for students in years Prep-2). It has a kindergarten attached to the Clarke St campus. It is one of the biggest primary schools in the region and is currently seeking government funding to redevelop its facilities to cater for significant growth in student numbers.

The population was 2,381 at the 2010 census. Popular with tourists, Hallowell is noted for its culture and old architecture. Hallowell is included in the Augusta, Maine micropolitan New England City and Town Area.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe city is named for Benjamin Hallowell, a Boston merchant and one of the Kennebec Proprietors, holders of land originally granted to the Plymouth Company by the British monarchy in the 1620s.\\n\\nFirst to settle here was Deacon Pease Clark, who emigrated with his wife and son Peter from Attleborough, Massachusetts, in the spring of 1762. Legend has it that after disembarking on the west side of the Kennebec, near present-day Water Street, the Clarks took shelter in their overturned cart. On a riverfront lot measuring 50 rods (275 yards, about 250 meters), the Clark family raised corn, rye and other crops. The first land they cleared was occupied by the fire department in 1859.\\n\\nIn 1797, the modern city of Augusta split from Hallowell to be a separate town. The part of Hallowell that is the current city was then known as \"The Hook\". Today, the city\\'s population (2,467) is only slightly smaller than it was in 1820, the year Maine seceded from Massachusetts and became a state. Yet 183 years ago, Hallowell\\'s inhabitants enjoyed the services of 71 stores along Water Street (by contrast, Augusta had a population of 1,000 and just 20 merchants).\\n\\nThriving industries included logging, trading, publishing and shipbuilding. Location on the navigable Kennebec River estuary allowed 50 ships launched from Hallowell\\'s wharves to reach the Atlantic Ocean between 1783 and 1901. Two grist mills, five sawmills and two slaughterhouses served the needs of residents near and far.\\n\\nIn 1815, the first granite quarried near the Manchester town line signaled the birth of an industry that would support Hallowell until 1908, when cement displaced stone as the construction material of choice. In 1826, the ice industry began in earnest, employing thousands over the next 75 years. Frozen blocks loaded onto Hallowell\\'s schooners were delivered to Cuba and the West Indies. Other local products exported via the Kennebec (and, after 1857, by train) from Hallowell included sandpaper, textiles from cotton from the Deep South, rope, linseed oil, oilcloth, wire, books and shoes.\\n\\nWhile the Kennebec River sustained the city from its inception, this mighty freeway also inspired fear. Spring floods regularly terrorized shopkeepers and sometimes brought commerce to a standstill.

The cavity formed between the layers is pressurized with air producing a rigid structural element which allows large span structures to be achieved. The key difference between air-supported buildings and inflatable buildings is that air-supported buildings require airlocks at all the access points to prevent air being lost when doors are opened since the entire occupied space of the building is pressurized.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nAn inflatable building only requires pressurized air within the cavities of the walls and so does not require airlocks since the occupied interior of the building is at normal atmospheric pressure. Since a much lower volume of air is pressurized, inflatable buildings require less power for continuous operation.\\n\\nThe air contained within the walls of an inflatable building becomes a true structural part of the building. The membranes used in the construction of such buildings are typically less than 1mm thick, so the amount of membrane used compared to the volume of air contained within the walls is incredibly low (typically less than 0.5%). This makes inflatable buildings efficient in terms of the amount of raw materials required to construct them.\\n\\nThe small amount of material used in the construction of inflatable buildings makes them highly portable. When a building needs to be moved, the air can simply be allowed to escape enabling an entire building to be packed into a small volume compared to its inflated size. The building can then be transported easily to its new location and re-inflated.\\n\\nSection::::Types.\\nInflatable structures and inflatable buildings are used in many ways including membrane roofs and covers, sails, buildings and pavilions, airships, furniture, airspace structures, boats, escape slides, security mattresses, swimming pools, coverings, games and castles, air bags and many other applications. Examples include an inflatable church and an inflatable pub.\\n\\n\\nSection::::References.\\nhttp://inflatable.pub/\\n', 'title': 'Inflatable building', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11605730'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'gxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11606954', 'text': 'Andrew Russell\\n\\nAndrew Russell may refer to:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Andrew Russell', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11606954'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11608122', 'text': 'Nicholas Elko\\n\\nNicholas Thomas Elko (December 14, 1909 – May 18, 1991) was the third bishop of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, the American branch of the Ruthenian Catholic Church. At the age of 46 he became the first American-born Bishop of the Greek Catholic Church. He later served as Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Ohio.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn on December 14, 1909, to Rusyn immigrant parents in Donora, Pennsylvania, a steel town in the Monongahela River Valley, he attended the public schools there and in 1930 graduated from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He completed graduate theological studies at the Greek Catholic Seminary in Uzhhorod and at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. Bishop Basil Takach ordained him to the priesthood on September 30, 1934, at St. Nicholas Greek Catholic Church in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nHe next served as pastor in several parishes throughout the Exarchate and as the spiritual director of the Greek Catholic Union of the USA, the oldest continuous fraternal benefit society for Rusyn immigrants and their descendants in the U.S. Elko also served in the administration of the Exarchate as Dean of the Cleveland Deanery, Consultor, and eventually as Vicar General. Pope Pius XII in 1952 named him a domestic prelate with the title of Reverend Monsignor. He was appointed that same year as the Rector of the Exarchate\\'s new seminary, the Byzantine Catholic Seminary of SS. Cyril and Methodius. \\n\\nBishop Daniel Ivancho appointed Elko in 1954 as the Rector of St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral. Yet just three months later, Ivancho abruptly resigned as bishop, and the Holy See directed Elko, as the Vicar General of the Exarchate, to administer it. On February 16, 1955, Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, the Vatican\\'s delegate to the United States, announced that Elko would be elevated to the episcopacy. On March 6, 1955, he was ordained as Bishop at St. Peter\\'s Basilica in Rome, Italy, by Cardinal Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant, Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Secretary of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.\\n\\nSection::::Episcopate of Bishop Elko.\\nThe formerly immigrant Ruthenian Church was by the 1950s now overwhelmingly American-born and modernizing rapidly in the post-World War II era. Bishop Elko sought to engage the new generation by leading change within the Exarchate. He immediately sought and was granted permission by Rome to permit English, in addition to the ancient liturgical language Old Church Slavonic, to be used in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. \\n\\nHe next established in 1956 a new weekly newspaper, \"The Byzantine Catholic World\". The term \"Byzantine Catholic\" was relatively new and represented something of a re-branding for the Church. The term began in usage in the 1940s in an effort to clarify the ritual identification of the Church to the majority American Latin-Rite Catholics, replacing the traditional European appellation of \"Greek Catholic\". The Church roots were historically \"Greek\" in the sense that Christianity came to the Slavs in the 9th century by the missionary brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius. But the new name aimed to evoke the even older and more glorious history of Eastern Christianity in Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nElko\\'s administration also undertook the construction of more than one hundred churches and schools. However, in the spirit of modernism, Elko recommended that many traditional Byzantine architectural features, such iconostasis, or as icon screens, be omitted or removed from the new or renovated churches. The Church\\'s membership, largely in the northeastern United States, began to migrate to the West. Elko assigned priests to do organizational work there, and established new parishes in California and Alaska. \\n\\nSection::::Rome upgrades the American Church\\'s status.\\nSince its inception in 1924 as the \"Apostolic Exarchate of United States of America, Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Ruthenian)\", the organizational status of Elko\\'s American Greek Catholic Church was merely that of a missionary territory with limited self-governing authority, the homeland being Europe—albeit under Communist persecution since 1946. \\n\\nOn July 6, 1963, the Vatican upgraded the status of the church from Exarchate to Eparchy, or diocese according to the Latin-Rite terminology. A decree by the newly elected Pope Paul VI divided the entire U.S. territory of the Church into two separate ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The first, centered in Passaic, New Jersey, included the Eastern states and the second jurisdiction, centered in Pittsburgh, included the rest of the nation. Both jurisdictions now held the canonical status of an eparchy or a full diocese. Elko continued as the American Church\\'s senior hierarch, but a new bishop, Stephen Kocisko, was installed for Passaic. \\n\\nSection::::The Second Vatican Council and the Eastern Catholic Churches.\\nElko was appointed a Consultor to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and took part in the proceedings, held in Rome from 1962–1965, of the Second Vatican Council. It issued a decree, promulgated by Paul VI on November 21, 1964, titled \"Orientalium Ecclesiarum\". The new policy underscored the richness of the Eastern Rite churches and respect for them. It urged Eastern Rites to return to the roots of their distinctive rituals and to avoid Latinization of their practices.\\n\\nThe decree heartened conservatives in the Byzantine Church, and to many seemed a repudiation of Elko\\'s \"reforms\", particularly during the building boom of the previous years.\\n\\nSection::::Controversy.\\nBy 1967, Elko\\'s popularity within his own Church waned on account of the rapid change he led, the confusion among laity around many Vatican II reforms, and especially Elko\\'s authoritarian management style. Whether priest or laity, liberal or conservative, many in the Church were agitated by Elko\\'s leadership. Petitions were signed and sent off to Rome. The Vatican, fearing more dissension in the Church like that experienced during the 1930s, transferred Elko to Rome, where he was elevated to the dignity of an Archbishop and appointed as the ordaining prelate for the Byzantine Catholics in Rome and head of the Ecumenical Commission on the Liturgy. This prompted his resignation as Byzantine Catholic Bishop of Pittsburgh, and Monsignor Edward V. Rosack, the Chancellor of the Eparchy, was named as the temporary apostolic administrator.\\n\\n\"Time Magazine\" reported on the unusual situation, noting that a \"\"bishop is almost never separated from his see. For the past seven months, however, the Most Rev. Nicholas T. Elko, Ruthenian-rite bishop of Pittsburgh, has been in Rome, barred by his church superiors from returning to his diocese. The case of Bishop Elko, who describes his situation as \\'exile\\', casts fascinating light on Catholicism\\'s current internal stresses...\"\". Three years later, the Vatican sent Elko back to the U.S., but not to his Byzantine Church. \\n\\nSection::::Transition: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati.\\nIn 1970 Archbishop Elko started anew as Auxiliary Archbishop in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati (the first and only Eastern Rite Bishop to serve as Auxiliary of a Latin Rite Diocese in the U.S.). He served in this capacity for fourteen years, and upon reaching his seventy-fifth birthday, retired.\\n\\nHe wrote an historical novel at this time, which was published posthumously in 1994. \"White Heat Over Red Fire\" features Thomas Christophe, a young Eastern Rite Catholic Bishop ministering in post-war Austria. The novel makes much of the intrigues of the Cold War years, the struggles of the Church in Eastern Europe, the attempts to reconcile the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and the upheaval within the Catholic Church in the wake of Vatican II.\\n\\nIn 1987, Archbishop Elko, asked me to help him create a charity, where The Rosary would be sent to missions. With his permission, I named the project \"Rosaries Around The World\" He provided an Archdiocesan Directory and we created stationary for the letters to the missionaries. I sent out hundreds of letters and received an incredible response. In a 3 year span, we mailed over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Brown Scapulars and many other items, to world wide missions. We even received a personal letter from St. Mother Teresa. She received thousands for her houses around the globe. Fr. Malachy Brogan, a Franciscan missionary in the Philippines wrote to me this quote-\"Jim, your Rosaries are now to be found in the hands of the praying, the dying and the dead.\" The good Archbishop\\'s brother funded this project and this very Marian Archbishop left me with many stories to share. This was the highlight...Jim Hungler, his Altar Boy, driver, confidante and friend. Archbishop Pilarczyk allowed me to serve Archbishops Funeral Mass, RIP Your Grace. \\n\\nElko died on May 18, 1991, aged 81.\\nHe is interred in the Priest\\'s Circle at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Montgomery, Ohio.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::References.\\nI had the honor to be Archbishop Elko\\'s assistant for 3 years. He was a true son of Mary and loved our Lord and lived the life. In the last 2 years I was with him, we created a mission project entitled: \"ROSARIES AROUND THE WORLD\". We shipped to over 40 countries and a total of over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Scapulars. They went from St. Mother Teresa to Fr. Malachy Brogan, OFM. He wrote me once saying: \"Jim, the Rosaries you sent are now found in the hands of the praying, the dying and the dead.\" This was funded in total by the good Archbishop\\'s brother and blessed by Archbishop Elko and St. Pope John Paul II. \\n', 'title': 'Nicholas Elko', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11608122'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1160830', 'text': \"Swan Districts Football Club\\n\\nThe Swan Districts Football Club, nicknamed the Swans, is an Australian rules football club playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). The club is based at Bassendean Oval, in Bassendean, an eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. The club was formed in 1932, and joined the then-Western Australian National Football League (WANFL) in 1934, acting as a successor to the Midland Junction Football Club, which had disbanded during World War I, in the Perth Hills region.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSwan Districts finished seventh on the WANFL ladder winning seven out of 21 games in their debut season in 1934. The presence of established WANFL players like inaugural captain-coach “Judda” Bee from East Fremantle and Fred Sweetapple from West Perth was critical to the fledgling club's competitiveness. In 1935, Swans finished sixth on the WANFL Ladder with six wins and twelve losses and George Krepp won the Sandover Medal. The 1936 season saw the Swans pick up nine wins and eleven losses but still finish seventh on the League Ladder.\\n\\nThe 1937 season saw Swan Districts, under new coach Jim Ditchburn, finish in third place on the League Ladder with 14 wins and 7 losses, and play in their first finals series. Ted Holdsworth kicked 109 goals in the first 14 games before injury ended his season and East Perth beat them in the first semi-final 13.9 (87) to 11.7 (73). Swan Districts had another good season in 1938, finishing third with 11 wins and nine losses but were again beaten in the first semi-final by East Perth 8.18 (66) – 9.11 (65).\\n\\nIn 1939, with the loss of champion spearhead Holdsworth to Kalgoorlie, Swans slid to sixth on the ladder with seven wins from twenty games. In the following two seasons, despite Holdsworth's return, the club slid still further to finish last with only two wins in 1940 and three in 1941. Due to the Second World War the WANFL suspended its senior competition and implemented an under age competition to replace it. In 1942 Swans were unable to raise a side to play and did not compete at all. By 1943 Swan Districts assembled a side to compete in the under-age competition and performed exceedingly well, finishing fourth on the ladder with nine wins and eight losses, then winning the first semi-final against West Perth and the preliminary Final against Subiaco. Swans thus played in their first Grand Final only to be defeated by East Fremantle, the final score being East Fremantle 17.15 (117) to Swan Districts 11.11 (77). Jim Davies became the second Swan Districts player to win a Sandover Medal in 1944 with 33 votes in what was otherwise a forgettable season with Swans finishing sixth on the ladder, but in the restored open-age competition of 1945 their fortunes improved as they finished fourth on the league ladder only to be defeated in the first semi-final by South Fremantle.\\nHowever, Swan Districts fell off dramatically for the next fifteen seasons. During this period they never finished higher than sixth of eight teams, and overall won only sixty-one and drew one of their 301 matches, suffering from the fact that much of the area around Bassendean was “un-allotted” so that players such as Keith and Roy Harper, and Frank Coulson moved to more successful clubs. They were nonetheless instrumental in having the WANFL introduce its “Provident Fund” to allow league revenue to be shared amongst the clubs. In 1957 Swan Districts won their first Colts Premiership, repeating the dose in 1958, and these teams provided the nucleus of their successes in the early to middle 1960s.\\nAfter finishing last in 1960, Swan Districts appointed Haydn Bunton junior as senior captain-coach in early 1961, and improvement was immediate. Swan Districts won twelve and drew two of their twenty-one regular season matches to be a clear second and an ingenious tactic by Bunton against champion East Perth ruckman “Polly” Farmer won them a huge upset in the Grand Final, and two more premierships followed in 1962 and 1963. Swans’ fall afterwards was however just as rapid as their rise from 1960 to 1961. In 1964 Swans won seven of their first nine matches, but then State representative calls and form lapses affected the team so badly that they won only two of their final twelve encounters. After achieving their most successful home-and-away season under new captain coach Fred Castledine before being overwhelmed by a mediocre East Fremantle team in the 1965 Grand Final, they fell off completely in the following eight seasons. Swans in this era were hindered by the lack of a full-time coach or secretary that made it harder for them to recruit than other WANFL clubs. In 1968, Swan Districts came nearer to a winless season than any team in senior WA(N)FL competition between 1918 and 1998: winning only one game after the siren by a point against East Fremantle, and scored their all-time lowest score against East Perth. Swan Districts were also last in 1970 and 1971, and not until 1974 did they again make the finals, under the coaching of Jack Ensor, who most unusually never played senior League Football. Again, however, they declined abruptly, falling to wooden spooners in 1977 and 1978.\\n\\nJohn Todd, who took the coaching reins at Bassendean in 1977 and began with a big clean-out of players, brought with him a new winning culture, one which would emulate that of the Haydn Bunton era. By the 1980s, Swans became the dominant side in the WAFL, winning three straight flags in 1982, 1983 and 1984. Swan Districts fell drastically to be last in 1986 and 1988, but rose equally rapidly and after a stint coaching the West Coast Eagles in 1988 and 1989, Todd returned to the club and after being fifth with ten wins in 1989 they won a seventh premiership, beating Claremont 16.7 (103) to 10.17 (77). However, after several unsuccessful finals campaigns between 1991 and 1994 Todd returned to South Fremantle, where he began his football career, and Swan Districts fell rapidly downhill on and off the field under coaches Graham Melrose (1995 and 1996), Phil Cronan (1997 and 1998), Peter Wilson (1999) and Todd again from 2000 to 2002. Between 1995 and 2002 they did not play in the finals and overall won only 51 of 158 games.\\nAt the end of 2002, a season where Swans ran last in all three grades and were as lucky as in 1968 to escape a winless season in the seniors, the club's desperate financial trouble came to the public's attention and a concerted financial drive saw them rise to ten wins and a draw under new coach Steve Turner, and back into the finals in 2004 and 2005. They could not challenge Subiaco or South Fremantle for the flag, and in 2006 fell to only seven wins before Turner gave way to former Eagles star Chris Lewis early in 2007. Brian Dawson took over as coach of the seniors in 2008 and the club rebounded from disappointing results in the previous two years to play in the 2008 Grand Final which they lost to Subiaco. Dawson then steered the team to a preliminary final in 2009. Dawson announced his retirement at the end of the 2010 season. then took the team to the Grand Final which they won over Claremont by a single point.

Although filled with oil, it is electrically heated and does not involve burning any oil fuel; the oil is used as a heat reservoir (buffer), not as a fuel.\\n\\nSection::::How it works.\\nOil heaters consist of metal columns with cavities, inside which a heat transfer oil flows freely around the heater. A heating element at the base of the heater heats up the oil, which then flows around the cavities of the heater by convection. The oil has a relatively high specific heat capacity and high boiling point. The high specific heat capacity allows the oil to effectively transfer thermal energy from the heating element, while the oil's high boiling point allows it to remain in the liquid phase for the purpose of heating, so that the heater does not have to be a high pressure vessel.\\n\\nThe heating element heats the oil, which transfers heat to the metal wall through convection, through the walls via conduction, then to the surroundings via air convection and thermal radiation. The columns of oil heaters are typically constructed as thin fins, such that the surface area of the metal columns is large relative to the amount of oil and element which provides the heat. A large surface area allows more air to be in contact with the heater at any point in time, allowing for the heat to be transferred more effectively, which results in a surface temperature which is safe enough to touch. The relatively large specific heat capacity of the oil and metal parts means this type of heater takes a few minutes to heat up and cool down, providing a short-term thermal store.\\n\\nSection::::Efficiency.\\nAlthough oil heaters are more expensive to run and provide far less spatial heating than gas heaters, they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered heaters, such as oil heaters and fan heaters, as the only alternative.\\n\\nSeveral efficiency metrics can be measured in regard to heaters, such as the efficiency of heating a room with a given amount of power, and the efficiency of the electrical generator which powers the heater and power loss from transporting the electricity over power lines. Measures may also consider how well a heater keeps the temperature of a space above a certain point. Such a measure would find inefficiencies in heating an already warm room. Many heaters (the majority of available models) are equipped with a thermostat to prevent this inefficient heating, which in turn reduces running costs. This feature was much more common in oil heaters than in the cheaper fan heaters until recently; thus many older oil heaters will be cheaper and more efficient to run than their contemporary fan heaters that lack the thermostat.\\n\\nTypical oil heaters range in power consumption/output from 300 to 2400 watts, and their length and number of columns is roughly proportional to their power rating. A 2400 watt oil heater is usually approximately 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length.\\n\\nAll electric resistance heaters are 100% efficient, with operating costs determined by their wattage and the length of operating time. A 500 watt heater will take at least twice as long to reach the same thermostat setting as a 1000 watt unit; the total consumption of electricity is the same for both.\\n\\nBy contrast, an electrical heat pump used for home heating typically has an efficiency well above 100%, expressed as its coefficient of performance.\\n\\nSection::::Safety and features.\\nThe primary risk of oil heaters is that of fire and burns. In both regards they are generally more dangerous than hydronics and air conditioning, but less dangerous than electric fan heaters or bar radiators; this is due to the surface temperature of each type of heater.\\n\\nMost modern small heaters have some form of tilt sensor to cut power if they are knocked over or placed on an unstable surface. This can reduce the risk of fire if a heater is knocked over.\\n\\nFrom a safety standpoint, it is best to avoid having any object within three feet of an oil heater. Using an oil heater to dry clothes is not recommended by any modern manufacturer. There is a substantial fire risk if flammable materials such as clothing or bedding are left near a heater, especially synthetic fabrics such as polyester, which can melt or burn. Even though the surface temperature of the heater in normal operation is quite low, the extra thermal resistance of the clothing on the heater can cause its surface temperature to rise to the material's autoignition temperature. It should also be noted that some oil heaters contain strong warnings to avoid operation in damp areas (such as bathrooms or laundry rooms) because the moisture and humidity can damage components of the heater itself.\\n\\nOil heaters have been known to explode when their thermal fuses fail to shut them off. This can cause fire, thick black smoke, unpleasant odors, oil on walls and other surfaces, and disfiguring scalding.\\n\\nSome companies offer oil heaters with a fan, to increase the air flow over the heater. Since it is constantly bringing the colder air from the room into contact with the heater, that can improve the rate of heat flow from the heater into the room. The rate of heat flow from the heater into the air in contact with it is higher when there is a greater temperature difference between the heater and the air.\\n\", 'title': 'Oil heater', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11625477'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'khhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1162889', 'text': \"A.

Breuil initially thought that the microburins had a functional use as a type of microlithic burin. However, he later came to realize that the manufacturing technique was different from that of the burin and that they could be waste products from the manufacture of microliths, but they may have occasionally been reused for a useful purpose.\\n\\nA microburin is a fragment of a lithic flake, or more precisely, of a lithic blade, that shows on its upper face the beginnings of a notch terminating in an oblique flection (whose surface can only be seen from the lower side) that ends in a very acute trihedral apex. As stated earlier, it was thought that microburins were functional microliths, but carving experiments, along with the reassembly of pieces with perfectly aligned edges have demonstrated that they were a characteristic waste of a technique called microburin technique, or more correctly microburin blow technique, following a study of thousands of microburins originating from a variety of \\nsaharan sites.

As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 1,404. As the town developed at the beginning of the 20th century, it assumed a name derived from its proximity to the District of Columbia—the first syllable of Columbia and that of Maryland were combined to form \"Colmar\". Colmar Manor was incorporated in 1927.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::19th Century.\\nThe town is home to Dueling Creek, formerly in Bladensburg, Maryland, a small waterway that because of its secluded location was a popular site for dueling. Duels were banned in neighboring Washington, D.C., but legal in Maryland, and Dueling Creek was the site for more than 50 duels between 1808 and 1868. The most famous duel fought on the site was on March 22, 1820, between Stephen Decatur and James Barron. Decatur was mortally wounded in the exchange.\\n\\nDuring the War of 1812, on August 24, 1814, the area was the scene of the Battle of Bladensburg. The place became a battlefield again in the early days of the Civil War when Confederate troops mounted an assault on Battery Jameson, Fort Lincoln, now northeast Washington, D.C., which was one of a number Union defensive forts built around the nation\\'s capital to protect it from capture. The remains of Fort Lincoln are located on the hillside that is now a part of Fort Lincoln Cemetery.\\n\\nSection::::20th Century.\\nIn 1912, the Capitol Cemetery of Prince George\\'s County was incorporated on the Washington, D.C., boundary line. Directly north of the cemetery was the Shreve estate. The Shreve house was destroyed in the 1890s. The farm site was used by the 6,000 jobless men from Ohio who descended on the Capitol in 1894 as \"Coxey\\'s Army\". Bladensburg Road traversed the area, becoming more heavily traveled in the 1920s, and eventually became designated as U.S. Route 1. Part of the former Shreve estate was subdivided into building lots in 1918. The lots were wide by deep, arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The streets were originally named after President Woodrow Wilson (1913–21), members of his cabinet, and other prominent men of the era. Some time later, the streets were renamed to conform to the system in use in the District of Columbia. The location of the development within the first service area of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission offered homeowners modern water and sewer lines. The houses constructed were modest one- and two-story wood-frame buildings. In 1931, the town\\'s streets were paved and gutters were installed. A concrete block municipal building was constructed in 1934, followed by the construction of a brick schoolhouse in 1935. In 1959, a new municipal building was constructed to house the town\\'s administrative offices and police department.\\n\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the area along Bladensburg Road, now known as Alternate Route 1, became lined with commercial establishments, and much of the housing stock was used as rental units. A large urban renewal project in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in the demolition of many commercial properties along Bladenburg Road. The old businesses were replaced with new structures such as fast food restaurants and a shopping center. Streets and houses were also improved. The Colmar Manor Community Park was established along the west bank of the Anacostia River in the 1970s on the site of a sanitary landfill.\\n\\nIn 1999, Colmar Manor, Bladensburg, and Cottage City were lauded by the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities for their collaboration with Prince George\\'s County for the Port Towns Revitalization Initiative, which created a common \"Port Towns\" identity for the towns; encouraged businesses development through infrastructure and façade improvements; acquisition of historic properties and plans for their reuse; and reconstruction of the Bladensburg waterfront and marina.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nColmar Manor is located at 38°56\\'2\" North, 76°56\\'49\" West (38.933811, -76.947077).\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nSection::::2010 census.\\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 1,404 people, 374 households, and 282 families residing in the town.

Barnafoss is near Hraunfossar which burst out of Hallmundarhraun which is a great lava plain. Barnafoss is a waterfall in Western Iceland, about from Reykjavík. Barnafoss is on the river Hvítá in Borgarfjörður. Hraunfossar flows out of a lava field into Hvítá near Barnafoss, creating a stunning scenery.\\n\\nSection::::Barnafoss in folk mythology.\\nMany Icelandic folk tales have been associated with Barnafoss, the most famous being about two boys from a nearby farm, Hraunsás. One day, the boys' parents went with their ploughmen to a church. The boys were supposed to stay at home, but as they grew bored they decided to follow their parents. They made a shortcut and crossed a natural stone-bridge that was above the waterfall. But on their way, they felt dizzy and fell into the water and drowned. When their mother found out what had happened, she put a spell on the bridge saying that nobody would ever cross it without drowning himself. A little while later, the bridge was demolished in an earthquake.\\n\\nAnother waterfall, Barnafoss, is on the River Skjálfandafljót near the abandoned farm Barnafell in Ljósavatn County. There the river runs in a narrow, and close to deep canyon. According to legends, young and brave men jumped across its narrowest parts. During prolonged subzero periods, the spray creates an ice arch across the river above the waterfall and sometimes a rope was strung across the river there to quicken this development. Flocks of sheep were driven over that bridge to graze on Þingey, the island between the two branches of the river.\\n\", 'title': 'Barnafossar', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1166285'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11663918', 'text': 'Peter Martin (photographer)\\n\\nPeter Martin is one of Canada\\'s most respected photojournalists having covered over 10,000 assignments over an ongoing 40-year career.

Released for Microsoft Windows in early March 2013, it is the first major installment in the \"SimCity\" series since the release of \"SimCity 4\" a decade prior. An OS X version was released on August 29, 2013.\\n\\nThe game is considered to be a reboot of the \"SimCity\" series. Players can create a settlement that can grow into a city by zoning land for residential, commercial, or industrial development, as well as building and maintaining public services, transport and utilities. \"SimCity\" uses a new engine called GlassBox, allowing for more detailed simulation than previous games. Throughout its development, \"SimCity\" received critical acclaim for its new engine and reimagined gameplay; however, publications cautioned the game\\'s use of a persistent Internet connection, with which it stores saved games and allows players to share resources.\\n\\nPrior to release, \"SimCity\" received positive reviews; however, the game\\'s launch was met with negative reception as a result of widespread technical and gameplay problems related to the mandatory use of a network connection to play and save game data. These issues included network outages, problems with saving progress and difficulty connecting to the game\\'s servers. As a result, some reviewers were unable to review the game, labeling the launch a \"disaster\" and the game as \"unplayably broken\", urging players to avoid purchasing the game until the issues were resolved.\\n\\nSection::::Gameplay.\\nAlong with many of the cosmetic changes (such as up-to-date 3D graphics), \"SimCity\" uses the new GlassBox engine. \"We try to build what you would expect to see, and that\\'s the game,\" explains system architect Andrew Willmott, meaning that visual effects such as traffic, economic troubles, and pollution will be more obvious. Two other new features are a multiplayer component and finite resources.\\n\\nUnlike previous games in the series, the game has non-orthogonal and curved roads and zoning areas that can conform to different road types. Types of zones will include residential, commercial and industrial. The density is driven by the types of roads built around these zones.\\n\\nCities in a region are connected to each other via predefined regional networks such as highways, railways, and waterways. Elements such as traffic and air pollution are visible flowing between cities. Cities can trade resources or share public services with their neighbors like garbage collection or health care. Cities can also pool their collective wealth and resources to build a \"great work\" to provide benefits for the entire region like a massive solar power plant or an international airport. The larger the region, the higher is the number of cities and great works that can be built.\\n\\n\\nModules in \"SimCity\" are attachable structures that can add functionality to existing user-placeable buildings. One example is the extra garage for fire stations, which can provide additional fire trucks for increased protection coverage Another example is the Department of Safety for the City Hall, which unlocks more advanced medical, police and fire department buildings.\\n\\nThe user interface, which was inspired by Google Maps and infographics, was designed to convey information to the player more clearly than in previous \"SimCity\" games. Animations and color-coded visual cues that represent how efficiently a city functions are only presented when needed at any given moment. For instance, opening up the water tower instantly changes the landscape to a clear world where the density of water is recognizable. Or clicking on the sewage tab will immediately show how the waste of the citizens is flowing, and where the system is over capacity. Some of the other visualized data include air pollution, power distribution, police coverage, and zones.\\n\\nMany resources in the game are finite. Some are renewable, such as ground water. Lead gameplay engineer Dan Moskowitz stated, \"If you\\'ve built up an entire city on the economic basis of extracting a certain resource, when that resource runs out your economy will collapse.\"\\n\\nDifferent from some previous \"SimCity\" titles, each type of zone (residential, commercial, and industrial) is not divided into density categories. Instead the density of the roads next to them determines the type of buildings that will be created there. This means that there is only one of each zone type, and density of the buildings are determined by the density of the roads.\\n\\nRoads in \"SimCity\" are one of the most fundamental elements of the mechanics. Unlike previous \"SimCity\" games, roads carry water, power, and sewage. There are also many new tools for drawing roads. They include a straight line tool, one for making rectangular road squares, one for making sweeping arcs, one for making circles, and one for making free-form roads. There is also a more diverse range of roads to choose from. Starting at dirt roads and going up to six lane avenues with street car tracks, the density of the roads determines the density of the buildings next to them, so dirt roads will only develop low density buildings. There are two different categories of roads, streets and avenues. Streets are 24 meters wide and avenues are 48 meters wide. Since all streets are the same width, a dirt road can be upgraded to a high density street. In order to upgrade a street to an avenue, one would need to fully demolish the old street and replace it with a larger avenue. When high and low capacity roads intersect, the higher density roads have the right-of-way, thus stop lights and stop signs will be automatically placed. In order to space the roads so there will be enough room for buildings to develop, road guides are shown when hovering over an existing road.\\n\\nPlayers will be able to specialize cities on certain industries, such as manufacturing, tourism, education, or others. Each have distinct appearances, simulation behavior, and economic strategies. Players have the option to heavily specialize on one or build multiple specializations in any given city for diversity. The game will feature a simulated global economy. Prices of key resources like oil or food will fluctuate depending on the game world\\'s supply and demand. In particular, if players all over the world are predominantly selling drilled oil from within their game onto the global market, this will drive the price for this resource down. Conversely, a resource that has experienced very little exposure on the world market will be a scarce resource, driving the price up.\\n\\nSection::::Multiplayer.\\nThis version of \"SimCity\" is the first to feature full online play since Maxis\\'s \"SimCity 2000 Network Edition\", allowing for regions to house multiple cities from different players. Regions can alternatively be set to private or the game switched to an offline single-player mode for solo play.\\n\"SimCity\" requires players to be logged into EA\\'s Origin service to play the game, including when playing single player. An active Internet connection was required every time the game was launched and had to be maintained throughout gameplay at the time of release. The connection is asynchronous, so any brief network disturbance will not interrupt the gameplay though outages of longer than 19 minutes, as an editor posted on Kotaku, will cause loss of gamestate when playing online.\\nCities in a region can share or sell resources, and work together to build \"Great Works\", such as an Arcology.\\n\\nSection::::Development.\\nPrior to its announcement, the German magazine \"GameStar\" leaked concept art. Soon thereafter, a pre-rendered trailer was leaked. The official announcement took place on March 6, 2012 at the Game Developers Conference. Initially it was revealed that the game would be available for the Windows platform, and a later OS X edition was confirmed. EA showcased two new trailers for the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, showcasing in-game graphics for the first time.\\n\\nIn August 2012, applicants were allowed to sign up to test closed beta versions of the game that were later released in January and February 2013, in order to perform load testing on the game servers.\\n\\n\"SimCity\" creative director Ocean Quigley confirmed that an OS X version was in development, but would not be released at the same time as the Microsoft Windows version. A Maxis graphics engineer had earlier commented that the purchase of the Windows version through the Origin platform will entitle access to the future OS X version.\\n\\nSection::::Game engine.\\nEA/Maxis developed the game using a new simulation engine called GlassBox, which takes a different approach from previous simulation games. Those games first simulated high-level statistics and then created graphic animations to represent that data. The GlassBox Engine replaces those statistics with agents, simulation units that represent objects like water, power, and workers; each graphic animation is directly linked to an agent\\'s activity. For example, rather than simply displaying a traffic jam animation to represent a simulated traffic flow problem, traffic jams are instead produced dynamically by masses of Sim agents that simulate travel to and from work.<ref name=\"GlassBox Engine w/ SimCity\"></ref> A four-part video has been released featuring Dan Moskowitz, the lead gameplay engineer, talking about the engine simulation behavior.\\n\\nThe citizens in the game are also agents and do not lead realistic lives; they go to work at the first job they can find and they go home to the first empty home they find.\\n\\nAfter the release of the game, modders created mods that enabled offline play and access to debug developer tools. On January 9, 2014 Maxis published its policy on mods where they allow re-skinning and building creation but not mods that change the gameplay.\\n\\nSection::::Audio.\\nThe game\\'s audio is bound to the pulse of the simulation. When a building is running a simulation rule like generating power for example, its driving music and sound effects that are synchronized to the overall beat of the simulation. The audio is telling the player what the simulation is doing. Audio Director Kent Jolly stated that cars in the game are tracked individually. When a car leaves an intersection, the simulator plays a sound of a car pulling away. The sound also changes based on the speed of the game. As cars go faster, the audio is matched to what the player sees, while remaining true to the actual traffic.\\n\\nChris Tilton is the composer of the game\\'s orchestral score. The music subtly adjusts to the player\\'s experience based on various game states. An example of this is when the view is zoomed out, the player will hear a fuller version of the score. When zoomed in, certain elements of the tracks are taken away. This is done to help make room for all the activity going on in the player\\'s city. The music tracks are also written with population in mind, and the game exposes the full playlist as the player\\'s city develops and grows. Tilton sought to reinvent \"SimCity\"s music and not rehash the musical sensibilities of previous games.\\n\\nSection::::Release.\\nThe initial release of \"SimCity\" on March 5, 2013 in North America suffered multiple severe issues, particularly regarding the game\\'s requirement for a persistent Internet connection. After the game was made available for purchase through EA\\'s Origin delivery service, the high volume of users attempting to download and connect to EA\\'s game servers caused network outages. Players reported experiencing frequent problems during gameplay due to the outages such as long loading times, disconnections, crashing, and loss of saved game data.\\n\\nThe server problems and negative feedback led some publications to refer to the launch as \"disastrous\" and others have compared the launch unfavorably to that of \"Diablo III\", which experienced similar problems when it was first released. The issues caused online retailer Amazon.com to temporarily withdraw the downloadable version of \"SimCity\" from its marketplace citing customer complaints.\\n\\nIt was also discovered that there were several issues with the GlassBox engine such as traffic taking the shortest route instead of the route with the most available capacity and sims not living persistent lives but rather going to the nearest available workplace for work and nearest available house after work.\\n\\nSection::::Post-release.\\nEA responded to server issues by adding additional servers and developing a server patch that disables \"non-critical gameplay features [including] leaderboards, achievements and region filters.\" On the evening of March 7, Maxis general manager Lucy Bradshaw issued a statement in response to the launch problems, stating that more servers would be added over the weekend, thousands of players were playing and \"more than 700,000 cities have been built by our players in just 24 hours\". She went on to acknowledge that \"many are experiencing server instability\" and that \"players across Europe and Asia are experiencing the same frustration\". She confirmed that the number of servers would be increased stating \"We added servers today, and there will be several more added over the weekend.\"\\n\\nSenior producer Kip Katsarelis commented that the game servers were constantly at maximum capacity, partly due to the large number of players connected for extended periods of time, which has made it difficult for new users to connect: \"We added more servers to accommodate the launch in [Australia, Japan, and Europe]... our plan is to continue to bring more servers online until we have enough to meet the demand, increase player capacity and let more people through the gates and into the game.\"\\n\\nIn an article about \"games as a service\", Nathan Grayson from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said that the situation was unacceptable and that EA was handling the situation as well as could be expected, but the problem was that they had damaged the idea of \"games as a service\" and lamented the fact that games publishers hadn\\'t learned from previous similar launch failures: \"this just keeps on happening. ... servers have gone toe-to-toe with day-one stampedes in much the same fashion as a turtle against an 18-wheeler: ... Then nature runs its course, and developers and publishers alike scramble to glue one billion bits of finely pulped turtle back together again,\" and added \"A strong service – the kind people latch onto and ultimately demand as the norm – doesn\\'t just react.\"\\n\\nOn March 8, 2013, EA suspended some of \"SimCity\"s online marketing campaigns because of the game\\'s ongoing technical problems. EA has stated it will not be offering refunds for users.\\n\\nIn a blog post on March 8, Bradshaw gave an update on the server situation, reporting that the issues had improved and server space had expanded, but acknowledged that some users were still suffering stability problems. She also explained the reason for the failure; \"So what went wrong? The short answer is: a lot more people logged on than we expected. More people played and played in ways we never saw in the beta\" and called their error \"dumb\". She reported that server capacity had been increased by 120 percent and that errors had dropped by 80 percent. She also promised another update during the weekend. She also announced an offer of a free game from the EA catalogue, saying \"I know that\\'s a little contrived – kind of like buying a present for a friend after you did something crummy. But we feel bad about what happened. We\\'re hoping you won\\'t stay mad and that we\\'ll be friends again when SimCity is running at 100 percent.\" Maxis ruled out making the game able to be played offline, saying it would take a significant amount of engineering work for this to happen. Shortly afterwards, it was discovered that a line of code could be commented out, allowing the game to be played offline indefinitely. In addition, an article published by Rock, Paper, Shotgun highlighted ways in which, \"They could make an entire region single player offline with absolute ease.\"\\n\\nThe launch failures also led to fans of the series filing a petition through We the People on the official White House website calling for \"an industry-wide return policy for video games that rely on remote servers and DRM to function properly\" which was later covered by mainstream news organizations such as NBC News.\\n\\nTo compensate for the issues during the release, EA offered to early purchasers a free game on March 2013. All Origin users who purchased and registered the game before March 23 were allowed to choose a game for free among a small list of titles including \"SimCity 4\", \"Battlefield 3\", \"Dead Space 3\", \"Mass Effect 3\" and \"\".\\n\\nEA had maintained a Server Status page in the \"SimCity\" website. This allowed players to check the status of \"SimCity\" servers around the world.\\n\\nSection::::Patches.\\nSince the initial release, Maxis has distributed patches to the game via the in-game patching utility that automatically runs when the game is launched on a user\\'s computer. These patches have addressed, though not entirely fixed, among many other things, issues such as traffic intelligence, game-save rollbacks, and emergency vehicle routing. Maxis has continued to update the game to improve gameplay quality and eliminate bugs.\\n\\nA month following the game launch day, Maxis had released 8 official patches, bringing the game to version 1.8. Maxis released a 2.0 patch, purported to make significant improvements to gameplay and curb defects, that was distributed on April 22, 2013. On May 23, 2013, Maxis released patch 4.0, giving players more updates to the game and re-enabling leader boards. Patch 6 was released July 30, 2013, and included the game\\'s second new region added since the original release date. Patch 7.0, a notable update for users, was released on August 22, 2013. This patch included the addition of a bridge and tunnel tool, letting players create overpasses and underpasses. The update also improved traffic, making it smarter. All patches that have been released have included patch notes describing the contents of the patch and can be found on EA\\'s forums.\\n\\nAn offline mode was released in Update 10. The game can now be saved onto the local disk, and cities are static and do not operate while the player is working on an adjacent city.\\n\\nSection::::Expansion.\\nAn expansion called \"Cities of Tomorrow\" was announced on September 19, 2013. It was released on November 12, 2013 and is set 50 years in the future. It features new regions, technology, city specializations, and transportation methods.\\n\\nThe new features in \"Cities of Tomorrow\" are divided into three categories – \"MegaTowers\", \"Academy\" and the \"OmegaCo\". The MegaTowers are massive buildings built floor by floor with each floor having a specific purpose, being residential, commercial or to provide services like schools, security, power and entertainment. Each floor can provide jobs, services or housing for hundreds of citizens at the same time. The Academy is a futuristic research center that provides a signal called \"ControlNet\" to power up structures and improvements developed there and the OmegaCo is composed of factories used to produce an elusive commodity only known as \"Omega\" to increase the profits from residential, commercial and industrial buildings alike and manufacture drones to further improve the coverage of healthcare, police, fire services or just be used by citizens to perform shopping in their places, thus reducing traffic.\\nThe expansion also supports \"futurization\", in which futuristic buildings tend to \"futurize\" the buildings, roads, and services around them by significantly blending the roads and buildings to simply make them look more futuristic, such as differences in traffic lights (they have a different sprite), turning service cars more futuristic (futurizing a police station will significantly change the cars and architecture), and so on. Buildings that will futurize the vicinity are distinguished with a hexagon pattern at the lower part of the building when viewed in the Construction screen.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nSection::::Pre-release.\\nAt E3 2012 in June 2012, \"SimCity\" won 8 awards out of 24 nominations. On August 23, 2012, \"SimCity\" won Gamescom\\'s \"Best PC Game\" award. The Gamescom jury described the video game as having \"fantastic graphics\" and \"struck the right balance between retaining the trademarks of the old parts and making it interesting for beginners\". On December 14, 2012, the \"SimCity\" development team ran a questions and answers session on the Internet community Reddit where they received criticism for the game\\'s DRM-mechanisms, which require the user to be persistently connected to Electronic Arts\\' servers in order to be able to play the game.<ref name=\"reddit.com/r/IAmA\"></ref> The video games-focused blog Kotaku also voiced concern over the issue, worrying that Electronic Arts could one day shut down their servers, rendering the game unplayable.\\n\\nThis prompted a blog response from Bradshaw, in which she defended the always-online component with the comment that \"real cities do not exist in a bubble; they share a region and affect one another.\" She goes on to say that increased connectivity to neighboring cities allows for a better experience, allowing for better trade and wider scale effects such as crime and pollution to keep synchronized across the region. Bradshaw also noted the performance benefit due to the engine using EA\\'s server hardware to assist in gameplay calculations.\\n\\nHowever, \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" pointed out after the release that cloud resources were not used to support gameplay computation but simply to support inter-city and social media mechanisms. The information was also reported in the mainstream media Those were confirmed by a change in rhetoric from Bradshaw.\\n\\nAfter the first beta, EA Management staff discussed Q4 2012 results during which Peter Moore commented on the success of the beta, \"\"SimCity\", a completely new version of the treasured classic, includes deep online features. More than 100,000 people played the \"SimCity\" beta last weekend, (...) and the critical reception is shaping up well.\"\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nUpon release, \"SimCity\" was met with mostly mixed reviews, many of which were downgraded after reviewers received reports of server problems. It received mixed to negative reception soon after, with GameRankings and Metacritic assigning scores of 63.82% and 64/100, respectively.\\n\\nThe issues surrounding the launch affected critics\\' opinions and reviews of the game. Eurogamer, CNET, and IGN delayed their reviews due to being unable to connect to the game servers, and Polygon, which had reviewed the game before the launch, later dropped its 9.5/10 score down to 8/10, then later dropping it again to 4/10 in response to both the issues, and EA\\'s decision to disable gameplay features. Josh Derocher of Destructoid gave a rating of 4/10, saying that despite his enjoyment of the game, \"the online dependency, forced multiplayer, and DRM ruin it.\" Other critics such as Rock, Paper, Shotgun also noted the launch issues with the always-online nature of the game, servers, and cloud save systems. According to \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\", because a server connection is required even for single-player games, \"the game, by its very design, is hideously broken.\" Leif Johnson writing for GameTrailers gave the game an 8.0/10 stating, \"Aside from some issues with its online requirements, bugs, and restrictions on city size, it\\'s still a satisfying and addicting simulator that will grant dozens of hours of entertainment with one well-designed city alone.\" CNET UK reported on March 6 that review aggregator Metacritic accumulated a user score of 2.0/10 and several critics reported that the product on Amazon.com had an average rating of 1/5 stars. Amazon customers and the press reported problems with path-finding and artificial intelligence, broken economic simulation, multiplayer aspect not working as advertised, and iconic features missing compared to previous installments of the game.\\n\\n\"SimCity\" was also criticized for the size of the area the player is given to build a city; critics have noted it to be significantly smaller than what was available in previous games. Maxis responded to this criticism by stating that this was a deliberate compromise to ensure that the game would run smoothly on the majority of users\\' computers. Maxis has acknowledged that city size is a major complaint, but has stated that they are not currently working on an increase in size. However, they have stated that larger areas may appear in an upcoming release or expansion of the game. In October 2013, Maxis stated that due to player feedback, they attempted to implement larger cities through \"months of testing,\" but ultimately decided to abandon the concept as \"the system performance challenges [Maxis] encountered would mean that the vast majority of [SimCity\\'s] players wouldn\\'t be able to load, much less play with bigger cities.\"\\n\\nSection::::\"Cities of Tomorrow\" reception.\\n\"SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow\" received mixed reviews from critics.

The war was punctuated by widely separated battles, and began with England\\'s military expedition in 1585 to what was then the Spanish Netherlands under the command of the Earl of Leicester in support of the resistance of the States General to Spanish Habsburg rule.\\n\\nThe English enjoyed some victories at Cádiz in 1587, and saw the Spanish Armada retreat in 1588, but then suffered severe defeats of the English Armada in 1589 and the Drake–Hawkins and Essex–Raleigh expeditions in 1595 and 1597 respectively. Two further Spanish armadas were sent in 1596 and 1597 but were frustrated in their objectives mainly because of adverse weather and poor planning.\\n\\nThe war became deadlocked around the turn of the 17th century during campaigns in the Netherlands, France and Ireland. It was brought to an end with the Treaty of London, negotiated in 1604 between representatives of the new King of Spain, Philip III, and the new King of England, James I. England and Spain agreed to cease their military interventions in the Spanish Netherlands and Ireland, respectively, and the English ended high seas privateering.\\n\\nSection::::Causes.\\nIn the 1560s, Philip II of Spain was faced with increasing religious disturbances as Protestantism gained adherents in his domains in the Low Countries. As a defender of the Catholic Church, he sought to suppress the rising Protestant heresy in his territories, which eventually exploded into open rebellion in 1566. Meanwhile, relations with the regime of Elizabeth I of England continued to deteriorate, following her restoration of royal supremacy over the Church of England through the Act of Supremacy in 1559; this had been first instituted by her father Henry VIII and rescinded by her sister Mary I. The Act was considered by Catholics as a usurpation of papal authority. Calls by leading English Protestants to support the Protestant Dutch rebels against Philip increased tensions further as did the Catholic-Protestant disturbances in France, which saw both sides supporting the opposing French factions.\\nComplicating matters were commercial disputes. The activities of English sailors, begun by Sir John Hawkins in 1562, gained the tacit support of Elizabeth, even though the Spanish government complained that Hawkins\\'s trade with their colonies in the West Indies constituted smuggling. In September 1568, a slaving expedition led by Hawkins and Sir Francis Drake was surprised by the Spanish, and several ships were captured or sunk at the Battle of San Juan de Ulúa near Veracruz in New Spain. This engagement soured Anglo-Spanish relations and in the following year the English detained several treasure ships sent by the Spanish to supply their army in the Netherlands. Drake and Hawkins intensified their privateering as a way to break the Spanish monopoly on Atlantic trade. Francis Drake went on a privateering voyage where he eventually circumnavigated the globe between 1577 and 1580. Spanish colonial ports were plundered and a number of ships were captured including the treasure galleon \"Nuestra Señora de la Concepción\". When news of his exploits reached Europe, Elizabeth\\'s relations with Philip continued to deteriorate.\\n\\nSoon after the Portuguese succession crisis of 1580, English support was provided to Prior of Crato who then fought in his struggle with Philip II for the Portuguese throne. Philip in return began to support the Catholic rebellion in Ireland against Elizabeth\\'s religious reforms. Both Philip\\'s and Elizabeth\\'s attempts to support opposing factions were defeated.\\n\\nIn 1584, Philip signed the Treaty of Joinville with the Catholic League of France to stop the rise of Protestantism there. In the Spanish Netherlands, England had secretly supported the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who were fighting for independence from Spain. In 1584, the Prince of Orange had been assassinated, leaving a sense of alarm as well as a political vacuum. The following year was a further blow to the Dutch with the capture of Antwerp by Spanish forces led by Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma. The Dutch rebels sought help from England, which Elizabeth agreed to as she feared that a Spanish reconquest there would threaten England. The Treaty of Nonsuch was signed as a result – Elizabeth agreed to provide the Dutch with men, horses, and subsidies but she declined overall sovereignty. In return the Dutch handed over four Cautionary Towns which were garrisoned by English troops. Philip took this to be an open declaration of war against his rule in the Netherlands.\\n\\nSection::::War.\\nThe Anglo-Spanish War broke out in 1585, following the seizure of English merchant ships in Spanish harbors. In response the English privy council immediately authorised a campaign against the Spanish fishing industry in Newfoundland and off the Grand Banks. The campaign was a huge success, and subsequently led to England\\'s first sustained activity in the Americas. In August, England joined the Eighty Years\\' War on the side of the Dutch Protestant United Provinces, who had declared their independence from Spain.\\n\\nThe Queen through Francis Walsingham ordered Sir Francis Drake to lead an expedition to attack the Spanish New World in a kind of preemptive strike. Drake sailed in October to the West Indies, and in January 1586 captured and sacked Santo Domingo. The following month they did the same at Cartagena de Indias and in May sailed North to raid St. Augustine in Florida. When Drake arrived in England in July he became a national hero. In Spain however, the news was a disaster and this now further buoyed a Spanish invasion of England by King Philip.\\n\\nSection::::Dutch Revolt (1585–1587).\\nRobert Dudley, The Earl of Leicester was sent to the United Provinces in 1585 with a dignitary party and took the offer of Governor of the United Provinces. This however was met with fury from Elizabeth who had expressed no desire for any sovereignty over the Dutch. An English mercenary army had been present since the beginning of the war and was then under the command of veteran Sir John Norreys. They combined forces but were undermanned and under financed, and faced one of the most powerful armies in Europe led by the famed Alexander Farnese, the Duke of Parma.\\n\\nDuring the siege of Grave the following year Dudley attempted its relief but the Dutch garrison commander Hadewij van Hemert surrendered the town to the Spanish. Dudley was furious on hearing of Grave\\'s sudden loss and had van Hemert executed, which shocked the Dutch. The English force then had some successes - taking Axel in July and Doesburg the following month. Dudley’s poor diplomacy with the Dutch however made matters worse. His political base weakened and so too did the military situation. Outside Zutphen an English force was defeated in which notable poet Philip Sidney was mortally wounded, which was a huge blow to English morale. Zutphen itself and Deventer were betrayed by catholic turncoats William Stanley and Rowland York which further damaged Leicester\\'s reputation. Finally Sluis with a largely English garrison was besieged and taken by the Duke of Parma in June 1587 after the Dutch refused to help in the relief. This resulted in mutual recriminations between Leicester and the States.\\n\\nLeicester soon realised how dire his situation was and then asked to be recalled. He resigned his post as Governor - his tenure was a military and political failure, and as a result he was financially ruined. After Leicester\\'s departure, the Dutch elected the Prince of Orange\\'s son Count Maurice of Nassau as the Stadtholder and Governor. At the same time Peregrine Bertie took over English forces in the Netherlands.\\n\\nSection::::Spanish Armada.\\nOn 8 February 1587, the execution of Mary, Queen of Scots outraged Catholics in Europe, and her claim on the English throne passed (by her own deed of will) to Philip. In retaliation for the execution of Mary, Philip vowed to invade England to place a Catholic monarch on its throne. In April 1587 Philip\\'s preparations suffered a setback when Francis Drake burned 37 Spanish ships in the harbour of Cádiz, and as a result the invasion of England had to be postponed for over a year.\\n\\nOn 29 July, Philip obtained Papal authority to overthrow Elizabeth, who had been excommunicated by Pope Pius V, and place whomever he chose on the throne of England. He assembled a fleet of about 130 ships, containing 8,000 soldiers and 18,000 sailors. To finance this endeavour, Pope Sixtus V had permitted Philip to collect crusade taxes. Sixtus had promised a further subsidy to the Spanish should they reach English soil.\\n\\nOn 28 May 1588, the Armada under the command of Duke of Medina Sidonia set sail for the Netherlands, where it was to pick up additional troops for the invasion of England. As the armada sailed through the English channel, the English navy led by Charles Howard, 1st Earl of Nottingham and Francis Drake fought a battle of attrition with the Spanish from Plymouth to Portland and then to the Solent, preventing them from securing any English harbours. The Spanish were forced to withdraw to Calais. While the Spanish were at anchor there in a crescent-shaped defensive formation, the English used fireships to break the formation and scatter the Spanish ships. In the subsequent Battle of Gravelines the English navy inflicted a defeat on the Armada and forced it to sail northward in more dangerous stormy waters on the long way home. As they sailed around Scotland, the Armada suffered severe damage and loss of life from stormy weather. As they approached the West coast of Ireland more damaging stormy conditions forced ships ashore while others were wrecked. Disease took a heavy toll as the fleet finally limped back to port.\\n\\nPhilip\\'s invasion plans had miscarried partly because of unfortunate weather and his own mismanagement, and partly because the opportunistic defensive naval efforts of the English and their Dutch allies prevailed. The defeat of the Armada provided valuable seafaring experience for English oceanic mariners. While the English were able to persist in their privateering against the Spanish and continue sending troops to assist Philip II\\'s enemies in the Netherlands and France, these efforts brought few tangible rewards. One of the most important effects of the event was that the Armada\\'s failure was seen as a sign that God supported the Protestant Reformation in England. One of the medals struck to celebrate the English victory bore the Latin/Hebrew inscription \"Flavit יהוה et Dissipati Sunt\" (literally: \"Yahweh blew and they were scattered\"; traditionally translated more freely as: \"He blew with His winds, and they were scattered\".)\\n\\nSection::::English Armada.\\nAn English counter armada under the command of Sir Francis Drake and Sir John Norreys was prepared in 1589 to torch the Spanish Atlantic navy, which was refitting in Santander, Corunna and San Sebastián in northern Spain. It was also intended to capture the incoming Spanish treasure fleet and expel the Spanish from Portugal (ruled by Philip since 1580) in favour of the Prior of Crato. The English fleet departed from\\xa0Plymouth\\xa0on\\xa0April 13 but was then delayed for nearly two weeks by bad weather. Drake as a result had to bypass Santander where the majority of the Spanish fleet were being refitted.\\n\\nOn May 4, the English force eventually arrived at Corunna where the lower town was captured and plundered, and a number of merchant ships were seized. Norreys then won a modest victory over a Spanish relief militia force at Puente del Burgo. When the English pressed the attack on the citadel, however, they were repulsed. In addition a number of English ships were captured by Spanish naval forces. With the failure to capture Corunna the English departed and headed towards Lisbon, but owing to poor organisation and lack of co-ordination (they had very few siege guns) the invading force also failed to take Lisbon. The expected uprising by the Portuguese loyal to Crato never materialised. With Portuguese and Spanish reinforcements arriving the English retreated and headed North where Drake sacked and burned Vigo. Sickness then struck the expedition, and finally a portion of the fleet led by Drake headed towards the Azores, which was then scattered in a storm. Drake then took the best part of the fleet and plundered Porto Santo in Madeira before they limped back to Plymouth.\\n\\nThe English Armada was arguably misconceived and ended in failure overall. In the end, Elizabeth sustained a severe loss to her treasury.\\n\\nSection::::Dutch Revolt (1588–1595).\\nSoon after the defeat of the Armada, the Duke of Parma\\'s force stood down from the invasion. In the autumn Parma moved his force North towards Bergen op Zoom and then attempted to besiege the English-held town with a substantial force. The English in a ruse however managed to repel the Spanish and forced Parma\\'s retreat with heavy losses which boosted both Dutch and English morale. The following year Bertie under orders from the Queen left for France with a force to help the Protestants in their fight against the Catholic League. Sir Francis Vere assumed command of English forces thereafter - a position he retained during fifteen campaigns, with almost unbroken success.\\nIn 1590 an Anglo-Dutch force under Maurice and Vere respectively launched a campaign with the aim of taking Breda. In a remarkable feat a small assault force hid in a peat barge before a successful surprise assault that captured the city. With Spanish forces in France supporting the Catholic League as well as in the Low Countries, Maurice was able to take advantage, and thus started the gradual recapture of the Netherlands. This was known by the Dutch as the \\'Ten glory years\\'. Soon after Breda the Anglo-Dutch retook Zutphen and Deventer which restored English prestige after their earlier betrayals. After defeating the Spanish under the Duke of Parma at Knodsenberg in 1591 a new confidence in the army took shape. English troops by this time composed nearly half of the Dutch army. The reconquest continued with Hulst, Nijmegen, Geertruidenberg, Steenwijk and Coevorden all being taken within the next two years. In 1593 a Spanish attempt led by Francisco Verdugo to recapture Coevorden ended in failure when the Anglo-Dutch under Maurice and Vere relieved the place during the Spring of 1594. Finally the capture of Groningen in the summer of 1594 resulted in the Spanish army being forced out of the Northern provinces which led to the complete restoration of the seven provinces.\\n\\nAfter these successes Elizabeth could view the high confidence in the army and renewed the treaty with the States in 1595. English troops having been given high praise by the Dutch were kept at around 4,000 men. They were to be paid for by the States and the Queen would also be repaid on the Crowns expenses in instalments until a conclusion of peace was made.\\n\\nIn 1595, Maurice\\'s campaign was resumed to retake the cities of the Twente region from the Spanish. This was delayed after Huy was besieged in March but Maurice was unable to prevent its fall. When Maurice did go on the offensive an attempt to take Grol in July ended in failure when a Spanish force under a 90 year old veteran Cristóbal de Mondragón relieved the city. Maurice then tried to make an attempt on the city of Rheinberg in September but Mondragon defeated this move at the Battle of the Lippe. Maurice was then forced to cancel further planned offensives as the bulk of his English and Scots troops were withdrawn to take part in the attack on Cadiz. The Spanish under the new commander Archduke of Austria took advantage of this lull and recaptured Hulst the following year which led to a prolonged stalemate in the campaign and delayed the reconquest.\\n\\nSection::::Naval War and Privateering.\\nIn this period of respite, the Spanish were able to refit and retool their navy, partly along English lines. The pride of the fleet were named \"The Twelve Apostles\" – twelve massive new galleons – and the navy proved itself to be far more effective than it had been before 1588. A sophisticated convoy system and improved intelligence networks frustrated English naval attempts on the Spanish treasure fleet during the 1590s. This was best demonstrated by the repulse of the squadron that was led by Effingham in 1591 near the Azores, who had intended to ambush the treasure fleet. It was in this battle that the Spanish captured the English flagship, the \"Revenge\", after a stubborn resistance by its captain, Sir Richard Grenville. Throughout the 1590s, enormous convoy escorts enabled the Spanish to ship three times as much silver as in the previous decade.\\n\\nEnglish merchant privateers or corsairs known as Elizabeth\\'s \"Sea dogs\" however enjoyed more qualified success. In the three years after the Spanish armada more than 300 prizes were taken from the Spanish with a declared total value of well over £400,000. English courtiers provided money for their own expeditions as well as others, and even Elizabeth herself would make investments. The Earl of Cumberland made a number of expeditions and a few did yield profit - his first being the Azores Voyage in 1589. Others failed however due to bad weather and his 1591 voyage ended in defeat with Spanish galleys off Berlengas. Cumberland with Sir Walter Raleigh and Martin Frobisher combined financial strength and force that led to the most successful English naval expedition of the war. Off Flores island in 1592 in a naval battle the English fleet captured a large rich Portuguese carrack, the Madre de Deus as well as having outwitted a Spanish fleet led by Alonso de Bazán. The expedition\\'s reward equalled nearly half the size of the Kingdom of England\\'s royal annual revenue and yielded Elizabeth a 20-fold return on her investment. These riches gave the English an excited enthusiasm to engage in this opulent commerce. Raleigh himself in 1595 went on an expedition to explore the Orinoco river in an attempt to find the mythical city of El Dorado in the process the English plundered the Spanish settlement of Trinidad. Raleigh however exaggerated the wealth there on his return to England. Supporting Raleigh with his expedition was another led by Amyas Preston and George Somers known as the Preston Somers expedition to South America notable for a daring overland assault that saw the capture of Caracas.\\n\\nMany of the expeditions were financed by famed London merchants, the most notable of these being John Watts. An expedition Watts financed to Portuguese Brazil led by James Lancaster saw the capture and plunder of Recife and Olinda - which was highly profitable for both. In response to English privateering against their merchantmen, the Spanish monarchy struck back with the \"Dunkirkers\" devastating English shipping and fishing in the largely undefended seas around England.\\n\\nBy far the most successful English privateer was Christopher Newport who was backed financially by Watts. Newport set out in 1590 to raid the Spanish West Indies and in the ensuing fight saw the defeat of an armed Spanish convoy but Newport lost his right arm in the process. Despite this Newport continued the ventures - the blockade of Western Cuba in 1591 was the most successful English privateering venture made during the war. Both Drake and Hawkins died of disease on the later 1595–96 expedition against Puerto Rico, Panama, and other targets in the Spanish Main, a severe setback in which the English suffered heavy losses in soldiers and ships despite a number of minor military victories.\\n\\nIn August 1595, a Spanish force on patrol from Brittany, led by Carlos de Amésquita, landed at and raided Cornwall, burning Penzance and several nearby villages.\\nDuring the summer of 1596, an Anglo-Dutch expedition under Elizabeth\\'s young favourite, the Earl of Essex, sacked Cádiz, causing significant loss to the Spanish fleet, leaving the city in ruins and delaying a projected descent on England. The allies were unable to capture the treasure, as the Spanish commander had time to torch the treasure ships in port, sending the treasure to the bottom of the harbour, from where it was later recovered. Despite its failure to capture the treasure fleet, the sack of Cádiz was celebrated as a national triumph comparable to the victory over the Spanish Armada, and for a time Essex\\'s prestige rivalled Elizabeth\\'s own.\\n\\nThe Crown instead of controlling and taxing its subjects, competed with them for private profit, a race it failed to win, as the great naval expeditions were on the whole unprofitable. The last of the great English naval expeditions took place in 1597, led by the Earl of Essex known as the Islands Voyage. The objective was to destroy the Spanish fleet and intercept a treasure fleet in the Azores. Neither was achieved and the expedition ended in failure, and Essex on his return was scolded by the Queen for not protecting the English coast.\\n\\nIn the final years of the war, English privateering continued despite the strengthening of Spanish navy convoys – Cumberland\\'s last expedition in 1598 to the Caribbean led to the capture of San Juan, and had succeeded where Drake had failed. Newport struck at Tobasco in 1599 while William Parker successfully raided Portobello in 1601. Finally in 1603 Christopher Cleeve struck at Santiago de Cuba and in the last raid of the war Newport plundered Puerto Caballos.\\n\\nBy the end of the war English privateering had devastated the Spanish private merchant marine. The most famous pirates lauded by English literature and propaganda tended to attack fishing vessels or boats with small value for the Spanish crown. Spanish prizes though were taken at an attritional rate; nearly 1,000 were captured by the wars end, and there was on average a declared value of approximately £100,000-£200,000 for every year of the war.<ref name =\"Hornsby/Hermann17\">Hornsby & Hermann p. 17</ref> In addition for every Spanish prize brought back, another was either burned or scuttled, and the presence of so many English corsairs even deterred Spanish merchantman from putting to sea. This all later resulted in Spanish and Portuguese commerce being carried on Dutch and English ships which in itself created competition. Nevertheless throughout the war Spain’s important treasure fleets had been kept safe by their convoy system.\\n\\nSection::::Dutch Revolt (1597–1604).\\nBy 1597, Spanish bankruptcy and the war in France gave the Anglo-Dutch an advantage. At the Battle of Turnout a Spanish force was surprised and routed - Vere and Sir Robert Sydney distinguished themselves particularly. With the Spanish distracted by the siege of Amiens in France Maurice launched an offensive in the summer. This time both Rhienberg and Greonlo were finally taken. This was followed by the capture of Bredevoort, Enschede, Ootsmarsum, Oldenzaal and finally Lingen by the end of the year. The offensive success meant that most of the Republic had been recaptured and a significant barrier had been created along the Rhine river.\\nIn 1598, the Spanish under Francisco Mendoza retook Rheinberg and Meurs in a campaign known as the \"Spanish winter of 1598-99\". Mendoza then attempted to take Bommelerwaard island but the Dutch and English under Maurice thwarted the attempt and defeated him at Zaltbommel. Mendoza retreated from the area and the defeat resulted in chaos in the Spanish army - mutinies took place and many deserted. The following year the Dutch senate led by Johan van Oldenbarneveldt saw the chaos in the Spanish army and decided the time was ripe for a focal point of the war to be concentrated in Catholic Flanders. Despite a bitter dispute between Maurice and van Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch and a sizeable contingent of the English Army under Francis Vere reluctantly agreed. They used Ostend (still in Dutch hands) as a base to invade Flanders. Their aim was to conquer the privateer stronghold city of Dunkirk. In 1600 they advanced toward Dunkirk and in a pitched battle the Anglo-Dutch inflicted a rare defeat on the Tercio led Spanish army at the Battle of Nieuwpoort in which the English played a major part. Dunkirk was never attempted however as disputes in the Dutch command meant that taking Spanish occupied cities in the rest of the Republic took priority. Maurice\\'s force thus withdrew leaving Vere to command Ostend in the face of an imminent Spanish siege.\\n\\nWith the siege of Ostend under way, Maurice then went on the offensive on the Rhine frontier in the summer of 1600. Rheinberg and Meurs were thus retaken from the Spanish yet again, although an attempt on s\\'Hertogenbosch failed during the winter months. At Ostend in January 1602 after being reinforced, Vere faced a huge Spanish assault organised by the Archduke and in bitter fighting this was repelled with heavy losses. Vere left the city soon after and joined Maurice in the field, while Albert was replaced Ambrogio Spinola. The siege there dragged on for another two years as the Spanish attempted to take Ostend\\'s strongpoints in a costly war of attrition. Around the same time Maurice continued – his campaign Grave was retaken but Vere was severely wounded during the siege. An attempt by the Dutch and English to relieve Ostend took place in mid 1604 but the inland of port of Sluis was besieged and captured instead. Soon after the Ostend garrison finally surrendered, after a siege of nearly four years and costing thousands of lives – for the Spanish it was a pyrrhic victory.\\n\\nSection::::France.\\nNormandy added a new front in the war and the threat of another invasion attempt across the channel. In 1590, the Spanish landed a considerable force in Brittany to assist the French Catholic League, expelling the English and Huguenot forces from much of the area. Henry IV\\'s conversion to Catholicism in 1593 won him widespread French support for his claim to the throne, particularly in Paris (where he was crowned the following year), a city that he had unsuccessfully besieged in 1590. However, in 1594 Anglo-French forces were able to end Spanish hopes of using the large port of Brest as a launching point for an invasion of England by capturing Fort Crozon.\\n\\nThe French civil war turned increasingly against the hardliners of the French Catholic League. With the signing of the Triple Alliance in 1596 between France, England and the Dutch, Elizabeth sent a further 2,000 troops to France after the Spanish took Calais. In September 1597 Anglo-French forces under Henry retook Amiens, just six months after the Spanish took the city, bringing to a halt a string of Spanish victories. The first tentative talks on peace had already begun before the battle. The League hardliners started to lose ground and popular support throughout France to a resurgent Henry. In addition Spanish finances were at breaking point because of fighting wars in France, the Netherlands and against England. Therefore, a deeply ill Philip decided to end his support for the League and to finally recognize the legitimacy of Henry\\'s accession to the French throne. Without Spanish support the last League hardliners were quickly defeated. In May 1598, the two kings signed the Peace of Vervins ending the last of the religious civil wars and the Spanish intervention with it.\\n\\nSection::::Ireland.\\nIn 1594, the Nine Years\\' War in Ireland had begun, when Ulster lords Hugh O\\'Neill and Red Hugh O\\'Donnell rose up against English rule with fitful Spanish support, mirroring the English support of the Dutch rebellion. While English forces were containing the rebels in Ireland at great cost in men, general suffering and finance, the Spanish attempted two further armadas, in 1596 and 1597: the first was shattered in a storm off northern Spain, and the second was frustrated by adverse weather as it approached the English coast. King Philip II died in 1598, and his successor Philip III continued the war but was less determined.\\n\\nAt the end of 1601, a final armada was sent north, this time a limited expedition intended to land troops in southern Ireland to assist the rebels. The Spanish entered the town of Kinsale with 3,000 troops and were immediately besieged by the English. In time, their Irish allies arrived to surround the besieging force but the lack of communication with the rebels led to an English victory at the Battle of Kinsale. Rather than attempt to hold Kinsale as a base to harry English shipping, the Spanish accepted terms of surrender and returned home, while the Irish rebels hung on, surrendering in 1603, just after Elizabeth died.\\n\\nThe new king of England, James I, was the Protestant son and successor to the Catholic Mary, Queen of Scots, whose execution had been a proximate cause of the war. James regarded himself as the peacemaker of Europe, and the ultimate aim of his idealistic foreign policy was the reunion of Christendom. Therefore, when James came to the English throne, his first order of business was to negotiate a peace with Philip III of Spain.\\n\\nSection::::End of the war.\\nWith the end of the war in France the new King of Spain Philip III sought peace with England. By 1598 the war had become long and costly for Spain. England and Dutch republic too were war weary and both sides felt the need for peace. At the peace of Boulogne in 1600 however Spanish demands were adamantly rejected by the English and Dutch. Nevertheless, diplomatic routes were open between the Archduke of Austria and his wife Infanta Isabella (Philip\\'s sister) who differed in their policies to Philip\\'s. Philip wanted to preserve the hegemony of the Spanish empire, whilst the Archduke and Isabella sought peace and friendly relations.\\n\\nSoon after victory in Ireland the following year the English navy under Richard Leveson conducted a blockade of Spain; the first of its kind. Off Portugal they sailed into Sesimbra bay where a fleet of eight Spanish galleys under Federico Spinola (brother of Ambrogio) and Álvaro de Bazán were present. Spinola had already established his base at Sluis in Flanders, and was gathering more with an intent on a potential strike against England. In June 1602 Leveson defeated the Spanish which resulted in two galleys sunk and the capture of a rich Portuguese carrack. Months later in the English channel Spinola\\'s galley fleet gathered more galleys and sailed through the English channel once more but was defeated again by an Anglo-Dutch naval squadron off the Dover straits. The result of this action forced the Spanish to cease further naval operations against England for the remainder of the war.\\n\\nSection::::Treaty and aftermath.\\nThe treaty restored the status quo ante bellum, and the terms of the treaty were favourable both to Spain and England. For Spain the treaty secured her position as a leading power in the world. Spain\\'s upgrading of the convoy system had allowed it to defend its treasure fleets and retain its New World colonies. English support for the Dutch rebellion against the Spanish king, the original cause of the war, had ended. The Spanish would then concentrate their efforts on the Dutch in order to bring them to their knees with a knockout blow. A complete abandonment of the Dutch cause however was not promised in the treaty. The English held cautionary towns in Holland on the other hand were not surrendered despite Spanish demands. The sieges of Ostend and Sluis were allowed to continue until the end of those respective campaigns. The Dutch by 1607 had in fact prevailed - the Spanish did not deliver their knock out blow they had hoped for; the Twelve Year Truce formally recognized the independence of the Republic.\\n\\nFor England the treaty made sure the Protestant reformation there had been protected, and James and his ministers refused the Spanish demand for Catholic toleration in England. After the defeat at Kinsale in 1602, the Treaty of Mellifont was concluded the following year between James I and the Irish rebels. In the subsequent London treaty Spain pledged not to support the rebels. English public opinion however showed that the peace treaty was highly unpopular and many considered it a \"humiliating peace\". Many felt that the King had abandoned the Netherlands, their old ally, in order to appease the Spanish Crown and relations with James\\'s subjects were strained in the following years.\\n\\nThe agreement was well received in Spain. Big public celebrations were held at Valladolid, the Spanish capital, where the treaty was ratified in June 1605, in the presence of a large English ambassadorial delegation led by Lord Admiral Charles Howard. Some members of the Catholic clergy however questioned Philip III\\'s arrangements with a \"heretical power\".\\n\\nThe provisions of the treaty authorised merchants and warships of both nations to operate from each other\\'s respective ports. English trade with the Spanish Netherlands (notably the city of Antwerp) and the Iberian peninsula was resumed. Spanish warships and privateers were able to use English ports as naval bases to attack Dutch shipping or to ferry troops to Flanders.\\n\\nThe war had also diverted Tudor colonial efforts, but the English who had invested in privateering expeditions during the war garnered enormous windfall profits leaving them well placed to finance new ventures. As a result the London Company were able to establish a settlement in Virginia in 1607. The establishment of the East India Company in 1600, was significant for the growth of England (and later Great Britain) as a colonial power. A factory was established at Banten, Java, in 1603 while the Company had successfully and profitably breached the Spanish and Portuguese monopoly. While the incipient illegal trade with the Spanish colonies was brought to an end, there was deadlock over English demands for the right to trade in the East and West Indies, which Spain adamantly opposed. Eventually the complications resulted in the treaty avoiding any mention of the matter.\\n\\nFor Spain there was hope that England would eventually secure tolerance for Catholics but the Gunpowder Plot in 1605 however destroyed any possibility of this. As a result it put to rest Protestant fears that a peace with Spain would ultimately mean an invasion by Jesuits and Catholic sympathisers as the Elizabethan Recusancy laws were rigidly enforced by parliament.\\n\\nEngland and Spain remained at peace until 1625.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Anglo-Spanish War (1585–1604)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1090966'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'uhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '109097', 'text': 'Manasota Key, Florida\\n\\nManasota Key is a census-designated place (CDP) consisting mainly of the community of Englewood Beach in Charlotte County, Florida, United States.

It was incorporated on May 22, 1907, as Pablo Beach, and would later change its name to Jacksonville Beach in 1925. The city is part of group of communities collectively referred to as the Jacksonville Beaches. These communities include Mayport, Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Ponte Vedra Beach. When the city of Jacksonville consolidated with Duval County in 1968, Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and Baldwin, voted to retain their own municipal governments. As a result, citizens of Jacksonville Beach are also eligible to vote in mayoral election for the City of Jacksonville. As of the 2010 census, Jacksonville Beach had a total population of 21,362.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe area around present-day Jacksonville Beach was first settled by Spanish settlers. Spanish missions were established from Mayport to St. Augustine. Spain ceded Florida to Great Britain by treaty in 1763, only to have Spain regain it again, and then a final time in 1821 to the United States. American river pilots and fishermen came to Hazard, present-day Mayport, and established a port.\\n\\nSection::::Pablo Beach.\\nIn the late 19th century, developers began to see the potential in Duval County\\'s oceanfront as a resort. In 1883 a group of investors formed the Jacksonville and Atlantic Railroad with the intention of developing a resort community that would be connected to Jacksonville by rail. The first settlers were William Edward Scull, a civil engineer and surveyor, and his wife Eleanor Kennedy Scull. They lived in a tent two blocks east of Pablo Historical Park. A second tent was the general store and post office. On August 22, 1884, Mrs. Scull was appointed postmaster. Mail was dispatched by horse and buggy up the beach to Mayport, and from there to Jacksonville by steamer. The Sculls built the first house in 1884 on their tent site. The settlement was named Ruby for their first daughter. On May 13, 1886, the town was renamed Pablo Beach after the San Pablo River. In 1885, the San Pablo Diego Beach Land Co. sold town lots ranging from $50 to $100 each along with lots from $10 to $20 per acre within of the new seaside resort \"Pablo Beach\". In September 1892, work on the wagon road to Pablo Beach (Atlantic Boulevard) was begun. The first resort hotel called the Murray Hall Hotel was established in mid 1886 but on August 7, 1890 it was destroyed in a fire. By 1900 the railway company began to have financial difficulties and Henry Flagler took over as part of his Florida East Coast Railway. In late 1900 the railway was changed to standard gauge and was extended to Mayport.\\n\\nThe Spanish–American War broke out in 1898. The 3rd Nebraska arrived July 22, 1898, for training and embarkation. They encamped at Pablo Beach. They were led by three-time presidential candidate, William Jennings Bryan. After flooding in the camp at Pablo Beach the 3rd Nebraska moved to downtown Jacksonville.\\n\\nSection::::Jacksonville Beach.\\nThe amusement park phase of Jacksonville Beach began in 1905 with The Pavilion which was later expanded and called Little Coney Island. It was a popular tourist attraction that had such entertainment as a dance floor, swim room, bowling alley, and roller skate rinks. An issue with contracting and constant weathering of its wooden structure aged Little Coney Island causing it to be torn down in 1925. On June 15, 1925, the name Pablo Beach was changed to Jacksonville Beach. The Shad\\'s Pier was created in 1922 by Charles Shad and with help by Martin Williams. Around the same time W. H. Adams, Sr. created the Ocean View Pavilion amusement park on the former site of the Murray Hall Hotel. Adams wanted to create a larger roller coaster than the one at Little Coney Island. His vision resulted in a 93-feet high coaster. The location of the coaster by the beach made it vulnerable to damage and was eventually deemed unsafe. The coaster was then deconstructed to a smaller coaster. The deconstruction of the larger coaster hurt business at the amusement park. By 1949 the Ocean View Pavilion was in decline and then a fire destroyed it a few years later. The only amusement park in Jacksonville Beach today is Adventure Landing. The boardwalk declined in the 1950s due to the crackdown on gambling and games of chance. Driving on the beach was prohibited in 1979.\\n\\nPablo Beach made aviation history on February 24, 1921, Lt. Wm. DeVoe Coney, in a transcontinental flight from San Diego, California, landed at Pablo Beach, having made the flight in 22 hours and 17 minutes, beating the old record, set two years earlier, by 3 hours and 32 minutes. Coney\\'s record was soon eclipsed on September 5, 1922, by Jimmy Doolittle piloting a De Havilland DH-4 biplane from Pablo Beach to San Diego in an elapsed time of 21 hours and 19 minutes.\\n\\nIn 1968 most residents of Duval County voted to approve consolidation between the county and the City of Jacksonville. Jacksonville Beach, together with Atlantic Beach, Neptune Beach, and the Westside community of Baldwin voted to retain their own municipal governments. As such they are not part of the City of Jacksonville, but receive county-level services from Jacksonville, and vote for Jacksonville\\'s mayor and City Council. Judy Van Zant, widow of lead singer of Lynyrd Skynyrd Ronnie Van Zant, and her daughter Melody opened the Freebird Cafe in 1999. Freebird Live, as it later became, was a popular music venue that became a staple for Jacksonville Beach for 16 years until its closure in 2016. In September 1999 Hurricane Floyd destroyed the Jacksonville Beach Pier. Five years later the pier was rebuilt. In October 2016 Hurricane Matthew forced a mandatory evacuation for Jacksonville Beach. Hurricane Matthew came 40 miles off the coast of Jacksonville Beach causing major flooding. The Jacksonville Beach Pier was partially destroyed by Hurricane Matthew.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of . of it is land and of it (66.61%) is water. Jacksonville Beach is the largest town in the Jacksonville Beaches community. It is the eastern terminus of U.S. Route 90, which ends at an intersection with State Road A1A three blocks from the Atlantic Ocean. The city is located at (30.284091, -81.396074).\\n\\nSection::::Architecture.\\nIn general, the architecture of Jacksonville varies in style and is not defined by any one characteristic, and Jacksonville Beach is no exception. Designed by Marsh and Saxelbye, and completed in 1925, Casa Marina Hotel is a Mission style hotel popular in the 1920s when Jacksonville\\'s beaches were being developed. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on September 2, 1993. Constructed in 1947, the American Red Cross Volunteer Life Saving Corps Station is an Art Moderne style lifeguard station designed by local architect Jefferson Davis Powell. It was added to the National Register of Historic Places on May 5, 2014. Jacksonville Beach is also home to a notable collection of Mid-Century modern architecture. Perhaps the most notable of these works are those designed by architect William Morgan.\\n\\nSection::::Climate.\\nJacksonville Beach has a humid subtropical climate.\\n\\nSection::::Parks and recreation.\\nHanna Park is a public beach and city park located near Mayport in the Jacksonville Beaches area. It consists of of mature coastal hammock, and was formerly known as Manhattan Beach, Florida\\'s first beach community for African Americans during the period of segregation in the United States.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 20,990 people, 9,715 households, and 5,207 families residing in the city. The population density was 2,732.3 inhabitants per square mile (1,055.2/km²). There were 10,775 housing units at an average density of 1,402.6 per square mile (541.7/km²). The racial makeup of the city was 90.94% White, 4.82% African American, 0.27% Native American, 1.63% Asian, 0.04% Pacific Islander, 0.79% from other races, and 1.51% from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 2.99% of the population.\\n\\nThere were 9,715 households, out of which 21.8% had children under the age of 18 living with them, 40.5% were married couples living together, 9.4% had a female householder with no husband present, and 46.4% were non-families. 34.6% of all households were made up of individuals and 9.2% had someone living alone who was 65 years of age or older. The average household size was 2.13 and the average family size was 2.78.\\n\\nIn the city, the population was spread out with 18.0% under the age of 18, 8.7% from 18 to 24, 35.6% from 25 to 44, 24.7% from 45 to 64, and 13.0% who were 65 years of age or older. The median age was 38 years. For every 100 females, there were 100.7 males. For every 100 females age 18 and over, there were 99.7 males.\\n\\nThe median income for a household in the city was $46,922, and the median income for a family was $58,388 (these figures had risen to $62,897 and $80,054 respectively as of a 2007 estimate). Males had a median income of $36,385 versus $30,055 for females. The per capita income for the city was $27,467. About 4.2% of families and 7.2% of the population were below the poverty line, including 8.2% of those under age 18 and 7.0% of those age 65 or over.\\n\\nSection::::Government.\\nSince the 1968 consolidation between Duval County and the City of Jacksonville, Jacksonville Beach has been a separate municipality within the consolidated city of Jacksonville. As such, it has its own city manager, city council, and mayor, but it is subject to county-level governance by Jacksonville. The current mayor is Charlie Latham who was re-elected to a second four-year term in November 2016.\\n\\nSection::::Transportation.\\nBeach Boulevard (US 90) connects Jacksonville Beach to the Southside neighborhood of Jacksonville. It continues westward to downtown Jacksonville, via the Commodore Point Expressway and Hart Bridge. Butler Bouleveard (SR 202) begins in southeast Jacksonville at Philips Highway (US 1) and ends in southern Jacksonville Beach at 3rd Street South (SR A1A). SR A1A is a popular seaside scenic route extending from Fernandina Beach to Key West. In Jacksonville Beach it serves as the main commercial corridor, extending the length of the beachside community.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nThe Duval County Public Schools district operates public schools, including San Pablo Elementary School in Jacksonville Beach.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Jacksonville Beach, Florida', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=109150', 'cat_id': '109150', 'cat_title': 'Demographics_of_Armenia', 'cat_pages': '6', 'cat_subcats': '2', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'vxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10915749', 'text': 'Aggressive NK-cell leukemia\\n\\nAggressive NK-cell leukemia is a disease with an aggressive, systemic proliferation of natural killer cells (NK cells) and a rapidly declining clinical course.\\n\\nIt is also called \"aggressive NK-cell lymphoma\".\\n\\nSection::::Signs and symptoms.\\nPatients usually present with constitutional symptoms (malaise, weight loss, fatigue), and hepatosplenomegaly is commonly found on physical exam. Lymphadenopathy is also found to a lesser extent. Due to the aggressive nature of the disease, patients may initially present at a more advanced stage, with coagulopathies, hemophagocytic syndrome, and multi-organ failure. Rarely, individuals who have an aggressive NK cell lymphoma that is associated with latent infection with the Epstein-Barr virus (see next section) present with or develop extensive allergic reactions to mosquito bites. The symptoms of these reactions range from a greatly enlarged bite site that may be painful and involve necrosis to systemic symptoms (e.g. fever, swollen lymph nodes, abdominal pain, and diarrhea), or, in extremely rare cases, to life-threatening anaphylaxis. \\n\\nSection::::Cause.\\nThis disease has a strong association with the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), but the true pathogenesis of this disease has yet to be described. The cell of origin is believed to be an NK cell. Blastoid NK cell lymphoma appears to be a different entity and shows no association with EBV.\\n\\nSection::::Sites of involvement.\\nThis disease is typically found and diagnosed in peripheral blood, and while it can involve any organ, it is usually found in the spleen, liver, and bone marrow.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nLeukemic cells are invariably present in samples of peripheral blood to a variable extent. Pancytopenia (anemia, neutropenia, thrombocytopenia) is commonly seen as well.\\n\\nSection::::Peripheral blood.\\nThe leukemic cells have a diameter mildly greater than a large granular lymphocyte (LGL) and have azurophilic granules and nucleoli of varying prominence. Nuclei may be irregular and hyperchromatic.\\n\\nSection::::Bone marrow.\\nBone marrow involvement runs the spectrum between an inconspicuous infiltrate to extensive marrow replacement by leukemic cells. Reactive histiocytes displaying hemophagocytosis can be seen interspersed in the neoplastic infiltrate.\\n\\nSection::::Other organs.\\nLeukemic involvement of organs is typically destructive on tissue sections with necrosis and possibly angioinvasion, and the monotonous infiltrate may be diffuse or patchy.\\n\\nSection::::Immunophenotype.\\nThe immunophenotype of this disease is the same as extranodal NK/T-cell lymphoma, nasal type and is shown in the table below. CD11b and CD16 show variable expression.\\n\\nSection::::Genetic findings.\\nDue to the NK lineage, clonal rearrangements of lymphoid (T cell receptor; B cell receptor) genes are not seen. The genome of the Epstein Barr virus (EBV) is detected in many cases, along with a variety of chromosomal abnormalities.\\n\\nSection::::Treatment.\\nCurrently Aggressive NK-cell leukemia, being a subtype of PTCL, is treated similarly to B-cell lymphomas. However, in recent years, scientists have developed techniques to better recognize the different types of lymphomas, such as PTCL. It is now understood that PTCL behaves differently from B-cell lymphomas and therapies are being developed that specifically target these types of lymphoma. Currently, however, there are no therapies approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) specifically for PTCL. Anthracycline-containing chemotherapy regimens are commonly offered as the initial therapy. Some patients may receive a stem cell transplant. Novel approaches to the treatment of PTCL in the relapsed or refractory setting are under investigation.\\n\\nSection::::Epidemiology.\\nThis rare form of leukemia is more common among Asians in comparison to other ethnic groups. It is typically diagnosed in adolescents and young adults, with a slight predominance in males.\\n\\nSection::::Research directions.\\nPralatrexate is one compound currently under investigations for the treatment of PTCL.\\n', 'title': 'Aggressive NK-cell leukemia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10915749'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'wBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10916548', 'text': 'Volkstaat Council\\n\\nThe Volkstaat Council () was an organisation of 20 people, created by the South African government, to serve as a constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the idea of a Volkstaat to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a Volkstaat.\\n\\nSection::::Members.\\nThe members, all sympathisers of the volkstaat idea, were: Johann Wingaard, a retired industrialist and chairman of the council, Dirk Viljoen, a town planner (vice-chairman), Anna Boshoff, daughter of Hendrik Verwoerd, her son Carel, the nuclear scientist Wally Grant, Chris de Jager, Mars de Klerk and Hercules Booysen, three jurists, Ernest Pienaar, former general in the South African Defence Force, \"Natie\" Luyt, Piet Liebenberg, Chris Jooste and Pikkie Robbertze, four academics, Koos Reyneke, an architect, Douw Steyn, a senior member of the civil defence system, Herman Vercueil from the Transvaalse Landbou-unie, Kobus Visser, a former head of the Criminal Investigation Department, Flip Buys, an executive of the trade union Solidariteit, Duncan du Bois, a local politician in Durban and Riaan Visagie, a teacher.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Volkstaat Council was created by the South African government, via the Volkstaat Council Act in 1994. This was in accordance with sections 184A and 184B of the 1993 South African Constitution, which state: \"The Council shall serve as a constitutional mechanism to enable proponents of the idea of a Volkstaat to constitutionally pursue the establishment of such a Volkstaat…\".\\n\\nThe council\\'s funding was terminated in 1999, without the council being formally disbanded. The council produced a final report, making three key recommendations:\\n\\nThe provisions in the constitution allowing for formation of the council were removed in 2001, by the Repeal of Volkstaat Council Provisions Act, in accordance with the original act.\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath.\\nJohann Wingard, chair of the council, expressed the view in 2005 that he doubted if any government official ever opened any of the reports to read them. Additionally, he stated that only a \"civil war\" would ever enable Afrikaners to gain independence in any part of South Africa. The opposite is suggested, however, by the fact that then deputy president, Thabo Mbeki, and then Minister of Home Affairs, Dr Mangosuthu Buthelezi, quoted figures from Volkstaat Council reports in a report to parliament in 1999. Nelson Mandela, the president at the time, specially requested that the delivery of the report be delayed until he could attend its presentation personally.\\n\\nSubsequent to the disbanding of the Volkstaat Council, the Commission for the Promotion and Protection of the Rights of Cultural, Religious and Linguistic Communities was established in 2003. This committee is charged with the protection of the rights to cultural identity of all self-identifying groups in South Africa, including Afrikaners. The committee includes an Afrikaner, JCH Landman, who is also a member of the Afrikaner Alliance. The reports from the Volkstaat Council were to be handed over to this committee.\\n\\nThe ANC government formalised their stance on the issue in 1998-1999, when they declared that they would not support a Volkstaat, but would do everything they could to ensure the protection of the Afrikaner language and culture, along with the other minority cultures in the country.\\n', 'title': 'Volkstaat Council', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10916548'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'wRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10918883', 'text': 'Michael Haynes\\n\\nMichael Haynes may refer to:\\n\\n', 'title': 'Michael Haynes', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10918883'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'whhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10920420', 'text': 'Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana\\n\\nThe Nambassa Winter Show with Mahana was all about a bunch of aspiring young hippie entertainers who moved into a youth camp in west Auckland, out of which this community of 60 people produced and directed two musical theatrical productions and toured the North Island of New Zealand in a convoy of Mobile homes, buses and vans, performing at major centres and theatres throughout September and October 1978. While initially four main shows were scheduled for this collective theatre company, repeat and spontaneous performances around the nation saw this number of live performances increased to over 10. This theatrical extravaganza was organised by the Nambassa Trust as part of its national promotion of the arts and towards promoting its 1979 three-day music, crafts and Alternative lifestyle festival, which was held in Waihi and attracted 70,000 people.\\nThe Winter Show production had two parts. The Mahana rock opera, a live rock-theatre production made up of both Māori and Pākehā, combining traditional Māori songs and dances with modern rock music, and depicting early white European colonisation of New Zealand and the impact this had on its local indigenous Māori people. The second part was a high-energy theatre-rock production based on the old theme of cooperation versus competition. The \"Return of the Ancients\" told the story of the battle between \"space angels\" and \"black magicians\" for control of the planet earth. This visual creation was made up of actors, dancers and mime artists performing to a background of rock music, extravagant lighting with weird special effects, fire, bizarre costumes and giant masks.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nThe Nambassa Winter show was coordinated on a voluntary basis by proud young unemployed kiwi hippies against a national backdrop of high unemployment in New Zealand. This era heralded the reformation of many social issues and cultural ideas, with youth (today\\'s baby boomers), encouraging social revolution, while reshaping creativity and artistic direction away from the norm. This period in New Zealand also witnessed many young indigenous Māori activists protesting for land rights and to have past land acquisitions recognised and recompensed. This was the roaring seventies and countercultural idealism was in full swing.\\n\\nThe first 1978 Nambassa festival had been successful and some of the profits from this event were drafted into their Winter Show.\\n\\nTo make this event a reality, the Nambassa core group, who were based in the country villages of Waihi and Waikino at the foot of the ecologically sensitive Coromandel Peninsula, temporarily moved to the city and hired the St John youth camp west of Auckland, from where this production was implemented. Professional and amateur actors, musicians and dancers, choreographers, seamstresses, chiefs, masseurs, prop designers, auto mechanics, various sound and lighting technicians, roadies and administrators (who doubled as actors) assembled at the St Johns camp where, over a period of two months, this production was created and rehearsed. This was a live-in workshop, as most participants in the Winter Show were encouraged to take up temporary residency at the camp; thus the Mother Centre was established. Many participating amateurs later carved out professional careers in the entertainment industry .-\\n\\nSection::::Mahana Rock opera.\\nThe musical production of The Mahana rock opera was a colourful and perceptive view of early New Zealand life and began with the coming of the Māori in canoes from the South West Pacific, their meeting on the high seas and subsequent voyaging to Aotearoa. It portrayed the arrival of the white man, his politics, his religion, early colonisation and the often negative transformation of the country dear to Māoridom. The storyline and music climaxed as Māori and Pākehā do battle with each other, and continued with the eventual reconciliation of the two races. The rock opera employed many special effects, costumes, and some 20 actors, singers and musicians.\\n\\nMahana was formed in 1977 when a group of Māori and Pākehā friends who were mobile-truckers started jamming together. What they shared was a common bond. They were all mobile and lived with their families in a nomadic gypsy lifestyle in handcrafted house trucks and buses. They first came to notoriety when they performed on the Aerial Railway stage at the 1978 Nambassa three-day festival, becoming a huge hit. They called themselves \"Mahana\" in honour of a friend who loaned them his equipment to perform the 1978 festival. Within 24 hours and by popular acclaim they were headlining on the Nambassa main stage with a 20,000W PA in front of tens of thousands of people.\\n\\nAfter the Winter show Mahana performed at the Nambassa 1979 three-day festival in Waihi in front of 40,000 fans and again at the 1981 five-day celebration up Waitawheta valley. At Nambassa 1979 they formed their own self-contained gypsy encampment circle incorporating dozens of house-trucks and buses. This was the beginning of the Road-show Fayre era, and within their large magic circle enclosure, continuous entertainment and theatre was available for children and adults, organised and spontaneous. After the festival the Roadshow Fayre and Mahana continued their musically-founded gypsy lifestyle, touring from town to town entertaining people throughout the nation. Mahana was filmed live on the main stage at Nambassa 1979. The film was part of the New Zealand Film Commissions entry to the 1980 Cannes Film Festival.\\n\\nBy telling the story of New Zealand through a musical blending of the two cultures it was hoped that the Rock Opera would provide a vehicle to express their collective feeling of \"Ko Tahi Tatou\", \"We are one together.\"\\n\\n\"Mahana Rock Opera written by Billy TK and Mahana, and Produced and Directed by John Tucker and Mahana.\"\\n\\nSection::::The Return of the Ancients.\\nThe Return of the Ancients (1978) was a musical theatrical opera which presented a story told in the year 2975 by an old man from another dimension who recounted to the audience a strange and forgotten tale. He spoke of the legend of the lost planet earth, the evolution of humankind and the frail path humans have walked to find their destiny, encountering dark forces reincarnated as humans who sought to destroy culture and civilization. Utilizing best of 1970s visual technology using pulsating light beams, theatre, dance, mime, photo projections, fire, costume and rock music, the production portrays the age-old cosmic battles between the past and the future. The audience witnessed the seeming peace and tranquility at some point in evolution with live music from the legendary Rick Steele, Norma Leaf and Ted Chapman. But civilisation regressed, reflected by fast on-stage theatrics, heavy rock and explosions of special effects. Humans had to suffer captivity at the hands of the black magicians, ogias and demons that followed and obeyed the prince of darkness. Theatrically extravagant cosmic battles were fought live on stage as \"Space Angels\" dressed in multi-coloured rainbow cloaks descended from other planetary systems through two powerful beams of light, to do battle with the negative forces controlling and threatening the existence of planet Earth and its inhabitants.\\n\\n\"The return of the Ancients was written and produced by Peter Terry, Directed by Chris Cooper, Matthew Robinson and Grant Bridger.\"\\n\\nSection::::Principal winter show cast.\\nThe return of the Ancients\\n\"Danze co:\"\\n\\nDancers: Donna Farhi, Stephanie Burns, Caryn Dudson, Matthew Robertson, John Tresize, Bev Wynyard, Brian Tracey, Ellen Currie, Terry Blade and Greg Norman.\\n\\n\"Nambas Theatre troupe:\"\\n\\nFire eating: Mike Colonna and Dave Sheridan.\\n\\nFire dancers: Donna Farhi, Bev Wynyard and Stephanie Burns.\\n\\nPrince of darkness: Brian Tracey.\\n\\nDevil man: Daniel Keighley.\\n\\nOgias or Ogre: Shak MacCready, Fred Alder, Ted Chapman, Peter Terry, Ellen Currie and Brett Fitzpatrick.\\n\\nSpace Angels: John Tresize, Terry Blade, Bev Wynyard, Matthew Robertson and Greg Norman.\\n\\nSun Dancers: Mike Colonna, Dave Sheridan, Mike Taylor and Caryn Dudson.\\n\\n\"Live Music\" by: Rick Steele, Ted Chapman and Norma Leaf.\\n\\nOriginal music score written, arranged and performed by Simon Alexander.\\nProduced and mixed by Simon Alexander and Doug Rogers at Harlequin Studios.\\n\\nMahana Rock Opera\\n\\nLead guitar: John Cossar. 2nd guitar: Aramete.

Andrea developed out of a non-tropical low on May 9 about 150\\xa0miles (240\\xa0km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida, three weeks before the official start of the season. After encountering dry air and strong vertical wind shear, Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression on May 10 while remaining nearly stationary, and the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11. Andrea's remnant was subsequently absorbed into another extratropical storm on May 14. Andrea was the first pre-season storm to develop since Tropical Storm Ana in April 2003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in 1981.\\n\\nThe storm produced rough surf along the coastline from Florida to North Carolina, causing beach erosion and some damage. In some areas, the waves eroded up to 20\\xa0feet (6\\xa0m) of beach, leaving 70\\xa0homes in danger of collapse. Offshore North Carolina, high waves of 34\\xa0feet (10\\xa0m) and tropical-storm-force winds damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard, although all nine sustained injuries. Light rainfall was also reported in some coastal locations. Damage was minimal, but six people drowned as a result of the storm.\\n\\nSection::::Meteorological history.\\nIn early May, an upper-level trough dropped southward through the western Atlantic Ocean, forcing a back-door cold front—a cold front that moves southwestward ahead of a building surface ridge to its north or northeast—southward. For several days, forecast models had anticipated for the trough to evolve into a closed low pressure area, and on May 6, a frontal low with a large and well-defined circulation developed about 90\\xa0miles (140\\xa0km) east of Cape Hatteras. The low maintained scattered convection around its circulation center, and in conjunction with the strong high pressure to its north, a very tight pressure gradient produced gale-force winds near the coastline. The extratropical storm tracked southeastward and later turned to the southwest while steadily deepening; on May 7, it attained hurricane-force winds. With a lack of tropical moisture, its corresponding convection was minimal and scattered.\\n\\nThe National Hurricane Center first mentioned the possibility of tropical cyclogenesis on May 8, while the storm was located about 230\\xa0miles (370\\xa0km) east-southeast of the South Carolina coastline. Its associated convection had steadily increased as it tracked slowly westward at 5–10\\xa0mph (8–16\\xa0km/h). The system changed little in organization throughout the day, though by the following morning, hurricane specialists indicated the low was acquiring subtropical characteristics as it tracked over progressively warmer waters. Early on May 9, a Hurricane Hunters flight into the system revealed winds of 45\\xa0mph (70\\xa0km/h) and a flat thermal core, which indicated the system was neither warm-core nor cold-core. In addition, satellite imagery indicated a consolidation of the convection near the center, as well as hints of upper-level outflow and a contraction of the radius of maximum winds from more than 115\\xa0miles (185\\xa0km) to about 70\\xa0miles (120\\xa0km). Based on the observations and the hybrid structure of the system, the National Hurricane Center classified the low as Subtropical Storm Andrea at 1500\\xa0UTC on May 9 about 150\\xa0miles (240\\xa0km) northeast of Daytona Beach, Florida. During a subsequent analysis of the storm, researchers estimated that the storm had transitioned into a subtropical cyclone nine hours earlier. As Andrea developed before June 1—the traditional start of hurricane seasons in the Atlantic Ocean—it became the first pre-season storm since Tropical Storm Ana in April\\xa02003. Additionally, the storm was the first Atlantic named storm in May since Tropical Storm Arlene in\\xa01981.\\nUpon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, Andrea was embedded within a large, nearly stationary deep-layer trough, resulting in a westward movement. Drifting over sea surface temperatures of no more than 77\\xa0°\\xa0F (25\\xa0°C), the organization of the system deteriorated with a significant decrease in convection. By early on May 10, much of the associated weather was located to the east of the cyclone within a band of moderate convection due to a brief spell of westerly vertical wind shear. The center of circulation had become disorganized, with several small cloud swirls within the larger circulation. This disorganization of the center, combined with increasing wind shear and dry air suppressing convective activity, caused it to begin weakening later that morning. By 1500\\xa0UTC on May 10, only a few thunderstorms remained near the center, and thus the NHC downgraded Andrea to subtropical depression status. Though a few intermittent thunderstorms persisted over the eastern semicircle, the depression remained disorganized and weak; the National Hurricane Center discontinued advisories early on May 11, after it had been without significant deep convection for 18\\xa0hours about 80\\xa0miles (125\\xa0km) northeast of Cape Canaveral, Florida.\\n\\nLater on May 11, convection re-fired over the center as the system drifted south-southeastward, though it lacked sufficient organization to qualify as a tropical cyclone. By May 12, shower activity had organized greatly to the east of the center, and the National Hurricane Center remarked that a small increase in convection would result in the formation of a tropical depression. It accelerated east-northeastward away from the continental United States without redeveloping, and after passing over cooler waters, the remnants of Andrea merged with an approaching cold front on May 14.\\n\\nSection::::Preparations.\\nDue to rough surf from the precursor low, local National Weather Service offices issued a High Surf Advisory for much of the coastline from Florida through North Carolina. Upon first becoming a subtropical cyclone, the National Hurricane Center issued a tropical storm watch from the mouth of the Altamaha River in Georgia southward to Flagler Beach, Florida. The watch was discontinued after Andrea weakened to a subtropical depression. Additionally, a gale warning was issued for much of the South Carolina coastline.\\n\\nAt Isle of Palms in South Carolina, workers and dozens of firefighters prepared sandbags in preparation for high tide after waves from the storm previously caused moderate beach erosion. As a precaution, officials there intentionally cut power and gas to multiple uninhabited buildings. Officials closed schools in Dare County, North Carolina due to the threat for high winds from the storm. The North Carolina Department of Transportation also canceled ferry transportation to and from Ocracoke and Knotts Island, North Carolina.\\n\\nSection::::Impact.\\nPrior to becoming a subtropical cyclone, the low produced gale-force winds and dangerous surf near the coast from North Carolina through Georgia, and later along the coast of Florida. Significant swells were also reported in the Bahamas. The waves caused beach erosion and washed up against coastal houses along the southeast coast of the United States.\\n\\nSection::::Southeastern U.S..\\nOff the coast of North Carolina, the storm produced 34-foot (10-m) waves and storm force winds which damaged three boats; their combined nine passengers were rescued by the Coast Guard. All nine were injured to some degree; three endured hypothermia, one received a broken rib, and one Coast Guardsman experienced back injuries from the surf. Another boat and its four occupants were reported missing, and after twelve days they remain missing. Rough waves from the precursor low left two kayakers missing near Seabrook Island, South Carolina. One was found the next day, and the other was found dead a week later.\\n\\nOnshore, winds reached 52\\xa0mph (84\\xa0km/h) in Norfolk, Virginia, with an unofficial report of 57\\xa0mph (92\\xa0km/h) near Virginia Beach. Similar observations occurred along the Outer Banks, with the winds knocking some tree limbs onto power lines; some isolated power outages were reported. Wind damage included some roofs losing shingles from the winds. In Elizabeth City, North Carolina, an outer rainband dropped 0.5\\xa0inches (10\\xa0mm) of precipitation in about two\\xa0hours as well as several lightning strikes; one bolt of lightning injured two firefighters. The winds covered portions of North Carolina Highway 12 with sand, and for a day the route was closed after waves from the storm washed out about 200\\xa0feet (60\\xa0m) of roadway. In some locations, the waves eroded up to 20\\xa0feet (6\\xa0m) of beach, leaving 70\\xa0homes in imminent danger. On St. Simons Island in Georgia, the storm produced a storm tide of 8.09\\xa0feet (2.43\\xa0m). Trace amounts of rainfall occurred in the southeastern portion of the state.\\n\\nSection::::Florida.\\nIn Florida, waves of over 10\\xa0feet (3\\xa0m) in height capsized a boat near Lantana; the two occupants were rescued without injury. Additionally, the waves displaced a sailboat that had previously been washed ashore in Juno Beach. Large waves flooded a parking lot and destroyed several fences and tree branches at Jupiter Beach, which resulted in its temporary closure; nearby a maintenance shed was destroyed. Eight leatherback sea turtle nests in Boca Raton were destroyed after the surf reached the dunes. Due to high surf, the beach pier at Flagler Beach was closed for about a day. Minor to moderate beach erosion caused the Florida Department of Transportation to fill in areas near the seawall with sand. One death occurred when a surfer drowned in the rough waves off the coast at New Smyrna Beach in Volusia County. Outer rainbands produced light rainfall, with the highest report in the Jacksonville National Weather Service area of responsibility totaling 0.77\\xa0inches (20\\xa0mm); the bands also caused tropical storm force wind gusts in the northeastern portion of the state. The winds spread smoke from local brush fires through the Tampa Bay area to Miami. High winds from Andrea were reported as fueling severe wildfires in northern Florida and southern Georgia.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Subtropical Storm Andrea', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10923896'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10924948', 'text': 'Karlapalem\\n\\nKarlapalem is a village in Guntur district of the Indian state of Andhra Pradesh.

It exists as two geometric isomers, \"E\" (\"trans\") and \"Z\" (\"cis\"). The term diazene is more common for organic derivatives of diimide. Thus, azobenzene is an example of an organic diazene.\\n\\nSection::::Synthesis.\\nThe traditional route to diimide involves oxidation of hydrazine with hydrogen peroxide or air. Alternatively the decarboxylation of azodicarboxylic acid affords diimide:\\nDiimide can also be efficiently generated by elimination of sulfonohydrazides using a suitable base. For example, 2,4,6-triisopropylbenzenesulfonohydrazide eliminates diimide upon treatment with sodium bicarbonate.\\n\\nBecause of its instability, diimide is generated and used \"in-situ\". A mixture of both the \"cis\" (\"Z-\") and \"trans\" (\"E-\") isomers is produced. Both isomers are unstable, and they undergo a slow interconversion. The \"trans\" isomer is more stable, but the \"cis\" isomer is the one that reacts with unsaturated substrates, therefore the equilibrium between them shifts towards the \"cis\" isomer due to Le Chatelier\\'s principle. Some procedures call for the addition of carboxylic acids, which catalyse the cis–trans isomerization. Diimide decomposes readily. Even at low temperatures, the more stable \"trans\" isomer rapidly undergoes various disproportionation reactions, primarily forming hydrazine and nitrogen gas:\\nBecause of this competing decomposition reaction, reductions with diimide typically require a large excess of the precursor reagent.\\n\\nSection::::Applications to organic synthesis.\\nDiimide is occasionally useful as a reagent in organic synthesis. It hydrogenates alkenes and alkynes with selective delivery of hydrogen from one face of the substrate resulting in the same stereoselectivty as metal-catalysed \"syn\" addition of H. The only coproduct released is nitrogen gas. Although the method is cumbersome, the use of diimide avoids the need for high pressures or hydrogen gas and metal catalysts, which can be expensive. The hydrogenation mechanism involves a six-membered CHN transition state:\\n\\nSection::::Selectivity.\\nDiimide is advantageous because it selectively reduces alkenes and alkynes and is unreactive toward many functional groups that would interfere with normal catalytic hydrogenation. Thus, peroxides, alkyl halides, and thiols are tolerated by diimide, but these same groups would typically be degraded by metal catalysts. The reagent preferentially reduces alkynes and unhindered or strained alkenes to the corresponding alkenes and alkanes.\\n\\nSection::::Related.\\nThe dicationic form, HNNH (diprotonated dinitrogen), is calculated to have the strongest known chemical bond.

A leap day is added in various solar calendars (calendars based on the Earth\\'s revolution around the Sun), including the Gregorian calendar standard in most of the world. Lunisolar calendars (whose months are based on the phases of the Moon) instead add a leap or intercalary month.\\n\\nIn the Gregorian calendar, years that are divisible by 100, but not by 400, do not contain a leap day. Thus, 1700, 1800, and 1900 did not contain a leap day; neither will 2100, 2200, and 2300. Conversely, 1600 and 2000 did and 2400 will. Years containing a leap day are called leap years. Years not containing a leap day are called common years. February 29 is the 60th day of the Gregorian calendar, in such a year, with 306 days remaining until the end of the year. In the Chinese calendar, this day will only occur in years of the monkey, dragon, and rat.\\n\\nA leap day is observed because the Earth\\'s period of orbital revolution around the Sun takes approximately 6 hours longer than 365 whole days. A leap day compensates for this lag, realigning the calendar with the Earth\\'s position in the Solar System; otherwise, seasons would occur later than intended in the calendar year. The Julian calendar used in Christendom until the 16th century added a leap day every four years; but this rule adds too many days (roughly 3 every 400 years), making the equinoxes and solstices shift gradually to earlier dates. By the 16th century the vernal equinox had drifted to March 11, and the Gregorian calendar was introduced both to shift it back by omitting several days, and to reduce the number of leap years via the \"century rule\" to keep the equinoxes more or less fixed and the date of Easter consistently close to the vernal equinox.\\n\\nSection::::Leap years.\\nAlthough most modern calendar years have 365 days, a complete revolution around the Sun (one solar year) takes approximately 365 days and 6 hours. An extra 24 hours thus accumulates every four years, requiring that an extra calendar day be added to align the calendar with the Sun\\'s apparent position. Without the added day, in future years the seasons would occur later in the calendar, eventually leading to confusion about when to undertake activities dependent on weather, ecology, or hours of daylight.\\n\\nA solar year is actually slightly shorter than 365 days and 6 hours (365.25 days), which had been known since the 2nd century BC when Hipparchus stated that it lasted 365 + − days, but this was ignored by Julius Caesar and his astronomical adviser Sosigenes. The Gregorian calendar corrected this by adopting the length of the tropical year stated in three medieval sources, the Alfonsine tables, De Revolutionibus, and the Prutenic Tables, truncated to two sexagesimal places, 365 days or 365 + − days or 365.2425 days. The length of the tropical year in 2000 was 365.24217 mean solar days, Adding a calendar day every four years, therefore, results in an excess of around 44 minutes every four years, or about 3 days every 400 years. To compensate for this, three days are removed every 400 years. The Gregorian calendar reform implements this adjustment by making an exception to the general rule that there is a leap year every four years. Instead, a year divisible by 100 is not a leap year unless that year is also divisible by 400. This means that the years 1600, 2000, and 2400 are leap years, while the years 1700, 1800, 1900, 2100, 2200, 2300, and 2500 are not leap years.\\n\\nSection::::Modern (Gregorian) calendar.\\nThe Gregorian calendar repeats itself every 400 years, which is exactly 20,871 weeks including 97 leap days (146,097 days). Over this period, February 29 falls on Sunday, Tuesday, and Thursday 13 times each; 14 times each on Friday and Saturday; and 15 times each on Monday and Wednesday. Excepting when a century mark that is not a multiple of 400 intervenes, consecutive leaps days fall in order Thursday, Tuesday, Sunday, Friday, Wednesday, Monday, and Saturday; then repeating with Thursday again.\\n\\nSection::::Early Roman calendar.\\nThe calendar of the Roman king Numa Pompilius had only 355 days (even though it was not a lunar calendar) which meant that it would quickly become unsynchronized with the solar year. An earlier Roman solution to this problem was to lengthen the calendar periodically by adding extra days to February, the last month of the year. February consisted of two parts, each with an odd number of days. The first part ended with the \"Terminalia\" on the 23rd, which was considered the end of the religious year, and the five remaining days formed the second part. To keep the calendar year roughly aligned with the solar year, a leap month, called \"Mensis Intercalaris\" (\"intercalary month\"), was added from time to time between these two parts of February. The (usual) second part of February was incorporated in the intercalary month as its last five days, with no change either in their dates or the festivals observed on them. This followed naturally, because the days after the Ides (13th) of February (in an ordinary year) or the Ides of Intercalaris (in an intercalary year) both counted down to the Kalends of March (i.e. they were known as \"the \"n\"th day before the Kalends of March\"). The Nones (5th) and Ides of Intercalaris occupied their normal positions.\\n\\nThe third-century writer Censorinus says:\\n\\nSection::::Julian reform.\\nThe set leap day was introduced in Rome as a part of the Julian reform in the 1st century BC. As before, the intercalation was made after February 23. The day following the Terminalia (February 23) was doubled, forming the \"\"bis sextum\"\"—literally \\'twice sixth\\', since February 24 was \\'the sixth day before the Kalends of March\\' using Roman inclusive counting (March 1 was the Kalends of March and was also the first day of the calendar year). Inclusive counting initially caused the Roman priests to add the extra day every three years instead of four; Augustus was compelled to omit leap years for a few decades to return the calendar to its proper position. Although there were exceptions, the first day of the \"bis sextum\" (February 24) was usually regarded as the intercalated or \"bissextile\" day since the 3rd century AD. February 29 came to be regarded as the leap day when the Roman system of numbering days was replaced by sequential numbering in the late Middle Ages, although this has only been formally enacted in Sweden and Finland. In Britain, the extra day added to leap years remains notionally the 24th, although the 29th remains more visible on the calendar.\\n\\nSection::::Born on February 29.\\nA person born on February 29 may be called a \"leapling\", a \"leaper\", or a \"leap-year baby\". In non-leap years, some leaplings celebrate their birthday on either February 28 or March 1, while others only observe birthdays on the authentic intercalary date, February 29.\\n\\nSection::::Legal status.\\nThe effective legal date of a leapling\\'s birthday in non-leap years varies between jurisdictions.\\n\\nIn the United Kingdom and its former colony Hong Kong, when a person born on February 29 turns 18, they are considered to have their birthday on March 1 in the relevant year.\\nIn New Zealand, a person born on February 29 is deemed to have their birthday on February 28 in non-leap years, for the purposes of Driver Licensing under §2(2) of the Land Transport (Driver Licensing) Rule 1999. The net result is that for drivers aged 75, or over 80, their driver licence expires at the end of the last day of February, even though their birthday would otherwise fall on the first day in March in non-leap years. Otherwise, New Zealand legislation is silent on when a person born on 29 February has their birthday, although case law would suggest that age is computed based on the number of years elapsed, from the day after the date of birth, and that the person\\'s birth day then occurs on the last day of the year period. This differs from English common law where a birthday is considered to be the start of the next year, the preceding year ending at midnight on the day preceding the birthday. While a person attains the same age on the same day, it also means that, in New Zealand, if something must be done by the time a person attains a certain age, that thing can be done on the birthday that they attain that age and still be lawful.\\n\\nIn Taiwan, the legal birthday of a leapling is February 28 in common years:\\n\\nThus, in England and Wales or in Hong Kong, a person born on February 29 will have legally reached 18 years old on March 1. If they were born in Taiwan they legally become 18 on February 28, a day earlier. In the United States, according to John Reitz, a professor of law at the University of Iowa, there is no \"... statute or general rule that has anything to do with leap day.\" Reitz speculates that \"March 1 would likely be considered the legal birthday in non-leap years of someone born on leap day,\" using the same reasoning as described for the United Kingdom and Hong Kong.\\n\\nSection::::In fiction.\\nThere are many instances in children\\'s literature where a person\\'s claim to be only a quarter of their actual age turns out to be based on counting only their leap-year birthdays.\\n\\nA similar device is used in the plot of Gilbert and Sullivan\\'s 1879 comic opera \"The Pirates of Penzance\": as a child, Frederic was apprenticed to a band of pirates until his 21st birthday. Having passed his 21st year, he leaves the pirate band and falls in love. However, since he was born on February 29, his 21st \"birthday\" will not arrive until he is eighty-eight (since 1900 was not a leap year), so he must leave his fiancée and return to the pirates.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Folk traditions.\\nThere is a popular tradition known as Bachelor\\'s Day in some countries allowing a woman to propose marriage to a man on February 29. If the man refuses, he then is obliged to give the woman money or buy her a dress. In upper-class societies in Europe, if the man refuses marriage, he then must purchase 12 pairs of gloves for the woman, suggesting that the gloves are to hide the woman\\'s embarrassment of not having an engagement ring. In Ireland, the tradition is supposed to originate from a deal that Saint Bridget struck with Saint Patrick.\\n\\nIn the town of Aurora, Illinois, single women are deputized and may arrest single men, subject to a four-dollar fine, every February 29.\\n\\nIn Greece, it is considered unlucky to marry on a leap day.\\n\\n', 'title': 'February 29', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10936', 'cat_id': '10936', 'cat_title': '1747_books', 'cat_pages': '4', 'cat_subcats': '1', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '0RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10936170', 'text': 'Star Trek: The Next Generation: A World For All Seasons\\n\\nStar Trek: The Next Generation – A World for All Seasons was a \"Star Trek\" adventure game under development by Spectrum HoloByte for the 3DO Interactive Multiplayer game console.

At the same time, the General Staff was in the process of withdrawing tens of thousands of personnel from the Group of Soviet Forces in Germany, the Northern Group of Forces in Poland, the Central Group of Forces in Czechoslovakia, the Southern Group of Forces in Hungary, and from Mongolia.\\n\\nThirty-seven divisions had to be withdrawn from the four groups of forces and the Baltic States, and four military districts—totalling 57 divisions—were handed over to Belarus and Ukraine.\\nSome idea of the scale of the withdrawal can be gained from the division list. For the dissolving Soviet Ground Forces, the withdrawal from the former Warsaw Pact states and the Baltic states was an extremely demanding, expensive, and debilitating process.\\nAs the military districts that remained in Russia after the collapse of the Union consisted mostly of the mobile cadre formations, the Ground Forces were, to a large extent, created by relocating the formerly full-strength formations from Eastern Europe to under-resourced districts. However, the facilities in those districts were inadequate to house the flood of personnel and equipment returning from abroad, and many units \"were unloaded from the rail wagons into empty fields.\"\\nThe need for destruction and transfer of large amounts of weaponry under the Treaty on Conventional Armed Forces in Europe also necessitated great adjustments.\\n\\nSection::::Post-Soviet reform plans.\\nThe Ministry of Defence newspaper \"Krasnaya Zvezda\" published a reform plan on 21 July 1992. Later one commentator said it was \"hastily\" put together by the General Staff \"to satisfy the public demand for radical changes.\"\\nThe General Staff, from that point, became a bastion of conservatism, causing a build-up of troubles that later became critical. The reform plan advocated a change from an Army-Division-Regiment structure to a Corps-Brigade arrangement. The new structures were to be more capable in a situation with no front line, and more capable of independent action at all levels. Cutting out a level of command, omitting two out of three higher echelons between the theatre headquarters and the fighting battalions, would produce economies, increase flexibility, and simplify command-and-control arrangements.\\nThe expected changeover to the new structure proved to be rare, irregular, and sometimes reversed. The new brigades that appeared were mostly divisions that had broken down until they happened to be at the proposed brigade strengths. New divisions—such as the new 3rd Motor Rifle Division in the Moscow Military District, formed on the basis of disbanding tank formations—were formed, rather than new brigades.\\n\\nFew of the reforms planned in the early 1990s eventuated, for three reasons: Firstly, there was an absence of firm civilian political guidance, with President Yeltsin primarily interested in ensuring that the Armed Forces were controllable and loyal, rather than reformed.\\nSecondly, declining funding worsened the progress. Finally, there was no firm consensus within the military about what reforms should be implemented. General Pavel Grachev, the first Russian Minister of Defence (1992–96), broadly advertised reforms, yet wished to preserve the old Soviet-style Army, with large numbers of low-strength formations and continued mass conscription. The General Staff and the armed services tried to preserve Soviet era doctrines, deployments, weapons, and missions in the absence of solid new guidance.\\n\\nA British military expert, Michael Orr, claims that the hierarchy had great difficulty in fully understanding the changed situation, due to their education. As graduates of Soviet military academies, they received great operational and staff training, but in political terms they had learned an ideology, rather than a wide understanding of international affairs. Thus, the generals—focused on NATO expanding to the east—could not adapt themselves and the Armed Forces to the new opportunities and challenges they faced.\\n\\nSection::::Internal crisis of 1993.\\nThe Ground Forces reluctantly became involved in the Russian constitutional crisis of 1993 after President Yeltsin issued an unconstitutional decree dissolving the Parliament, following the Parliament\\'s resistance to Yeltsin\\'s consolidation of power and his neo-liberal reforms. A group of deputies, including Vice President Alexander Rutskoi, barricaded themselves inside the Parliament building. While giving public support to the President, the Armed Forces, led by General Grachev, tried to remain neutral, following the wishes of the officer corps.\\nThe military leadership were unsure of both the rightness of Yeltsin\\'s cause and the reliability of their forces, and had to be convinced at length by Yeltsin to attack the Parliament.\\n\\nWhen the attack was finally mounted, forces from five different divisions around Moscow were used, and the personnel involved were mostly officers and senior non-commissioned officers. There were also indications that some formations deployed into Moscow only under protest. However, once Parliament had been stormed, the parliamentary leaders arrested, and temporary censorship imposed, Yeltsin succeeded in retaining power.\\n\\nSection::::Chechen Wars.\\nSection::::First Chechen War.\\nThe Chechen people had never willingly accepted Russian rule. With the dissolution of the Soviet Union, the Chechens declared independence in November 1991, under the leadership of a former Air Forces officer, General Dzhokar Dudayev.\\nThe continuation of Chechen independence was seen as reducing Moscow\\'s authority; Chechnya became perceived as a haven for criminals, and a hard-line group within the Kremlin began advocating war. A Security Council meeting was held 29 November 1994, where Yeltsin ordered the Chechens to disarm, or else Moscow would restore order. Defense Minister Pavel Grachev assured Yeltsin that he would \"take Grozny with one airborne assault regiment in two hours.\"\\n\\nThe operation began on 11 December 1994 and, by 31 December, Russian forces were entering Grozny, the Chechen capital. The 131st Motor Rifle Brigade was ordered to make a swift push for the centre of the city, but was then virtually destroyed in Chechen ambushes. After finally seizing Grozny amid fierce resistance, Russian troops moved on to other Chechen strongholds. When Chechen militants took hostages in the Budyonnovsk hospital hostage crisis in Stavropol Kray in June 1995, peace looked possible for a time, but the fighting continued. Following this incident, the separatists were referred to as \"insurgents\" or \"terrorists\" within Russia.\\n\\nDzhokar Dudayev was assassinated in April 1996, and that summer, a Chechen attack retook Grozny. Alexander Lebed, then Secretary of the Security Council, began talks with the Chechen rebel leader Aslan Maskhadov in August 1996 and signed an agreement on 22/23 August; by the end of that month, the fighting ended.\\nThe formal ceasefire was signed in the Dagestani town of Khasavyurt on 31 August 1996, stipulating that a formal agreement on relations between the Chechen Republic of Ichkeria and the Russian federal government need not be signed until late 2001.\\n\\nWriting some years later, Dmitri Trenin and Aleksei Malashenko described the Russian military\\'s performance in Chechniya as \"grossly deficient at all levels, from commander-in-chief to the drafted private.\"\\nThe Ground Forces\\' performance in the First Chechen War has been assessed by a British academic as \"appallingly bad\".\\nWriting six years later, Michael Orr said \"one of the root causes of the Russian failure in 1994–96 was their inability to raise and deploy a properly trained military force.\"\\n\\nSection::::Second Chechen War.\\nThe Second Chechen War began in August 1999 after Chechen militias invaded neighboring Dagestan, followed quickly in early September by a series of four terrorist bombings across Russia. This prompted Russian military action against the alleged Chechen culprits.\\n\\nIn the first Chechen war, the Russians primarily laid waste to an area with artillery and airstrikes before advancing the land forces. Improvements were made in the Ground Forces between 1996 and 1999; when the Second Chechen War started, instead of hastily assembled \"composite regiments\" dispatched with little or no training, whose members had never seen service together, formations were brought up to strength with replacements, put through preparatory training, and then dispatched. Combat performance improved accordingly, and large-scale opposition was crippled.\\n\\nMost of the prominent past Chechen separatist leaders had died or been killed, including former president Aslan Maskhadov and leading warlord and terrorist attack mastermind Shamil Basayev. However, small-scale conflict continued to drag on; as of November 2007, it had spread across other parts of the Russian Caucasus.\\nIt was a divisive struggle, with at least one senior military officer dismissed for being unresponsive to government commands: General Colonel Gennady Troshev was dismissed in 2002 for refusing to move from command of the North Caucasus Military District to command of the less important Siberian Military District.\\n\\nThe Second Chechen War was officially declared ended on 16 April 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Reforms under Sergeyev.\\nWhen Igor Sergeyev arrived as Minister of Defence in 1997, he initiated what were seen as real reforms under very difficult conditions.\\nThe number of military educational establishments, virtually unchanged since 1991, was reduced, and the amalgamation of the Siberian and Trans-Baikal Military Districts was ordered. A larger number of army divisions were given \"constant readiness\" status, which was supposed to bring them up to 80 percent manning and 100 percent equipment holdings. Sergeyev announced in August 1998 that there would be six divisions and four brigades on 24-hour alert by the end of that year. Three levels of forces were announced; constant readiness, low-level, and strategic reserves.\\n\\nHowever, personnel quality—even in these favored units—continued to be a problem. Lack of fuel for training and a shortage of well-trained junior officers hampered combat effectiveness. However, concentrating on the interests of his old service, the Strategic Rocket Forces, Sergeyev directed the disbanding of the Ground Forces headquarters itself in December 1997. The disbandment was a \"military nonsense\", in Orr\\'s words, \"justifiable only in terms of internal politics within the Ministry of Defence\". The Ground Forces\\' prestige declined as a result, as the headquarters disbandment implied—at least in theory—that the Ground Forces no longer ranked equally with the Air Force and Navy.\\n\\nSection::::Reforms under Putin.\\nUnder President Vladimir Putin, more funds were committed, the Ground Forces Headquarters was reestablished, and some progress on professionalisation occurred. Plans called for reducing mandatory service to 18 months in 2007, and to one year by 2008, but a mixed Ground Force, of both contract soldiers and conscripts, would remain. (As of 2009, the length of conscript service was 12 months.)\\n\\nFunding increases began in 1999; after some recovery in the Russian economy and the associated rise in income, especially from oil, \"Russia\\'s officially reported defence spending [rose] in nominal terms at least, for the first time since the formation of the Russian Federation\".\\nThe budget rose from 141 billion rubles in 2000 to 219 billion rubles in 2001.\\nMuch of this funding has been spent on personnel—there have been several pay rises, starting with a 20-percent rise authorised in 2001; the current professionalisation programme, including 26,000 extra sergeants, was expected to cost at least 31 billion roubles ($1.1 billion USD).\\nIncreased funding has been spread across the whole budget, with personnel spending being matched by greater procurement and research and development funding.\\n\\nHowever, in 2004, Alexander Goltz said that, given the insistence of the hierarchy on trying to force contract soldiers into the old conscript pattern, there is little hope of a fundamental strengthening of the Ground Forces. He further elaborated that they are expected to remain, to some extent, a military liability and \"Russia\\'s most urgent social problem\" for some time to come.\\nGoltz summed up by saying: \"All of this means that the Russian armed forces are not ready to defend the country and that, at the same time, they are also dangerous for Russia. Top military personnel demonstrate neither the will nor the ability to effect fundamental changes.\"\\n\\nMore money is arriving both for personnel and equipment; Russian Prime Minister Vladimir Putin said in June 2008 that monetary allowances for servicemen in permanent-readiness units will be raised significantly.\\nIn May 2007, it was announced that enlisted pay would rise to 65,000 roubles (US$2,750) per month, and the pay of officers on combat duty in rapid response units would rise to 100,000–150,000 roubles (US$4,230–$6,355) per month. However, while the move to one year conscript service would disrupt \"dedovshchina\", it is unlikely that bullying will disappear altogether without significant societal change.\\nOther assessments from the same source point out that the Russian Armed Forces faced major disruption in 2008, as demographic change hindered plans to reduce the term of conscription from two years to one.\\n\\nSection::::Serdyukov reforms.\\nA major reorganisation of the force began in 2007 by the Minister for Defence Anatoliy Serdyukov, with the aim of converting all divisions into brigades, and cutting surplus officers and establishments.\\nHowever, this affected units of continuous readiness () only. It is intended to create 39 to 40 such brigades by 1 January 2016, including 39 all-arms brigades, 21 artillery and MRL brigades, seven brigades of army air defence forces, 12 communication brigades, and two electronic warfare brigades. In addition, the 18th Machine Gun Artillery Division stationed in the Far East remained, and there will be an additional 17 separate regiments. The reform has been called \"unprecedented\".\\n\\nIn the course of the reorganization, the 4-chain command structure (military district - field army - division - regiment) that was used until then was replaced with a 3-chain structure: strategic command - operational command - brigade. Brigades are supposed to be used as mobile permanent-readiness units capable of fighting independently with the support of highly mobile task forces or together with other brigades under joint command.\\n\\nIn a statement on 4 September 2009, RGF Commander-in-Chief Vladimir Boldyrev said that half of the Russian land forces were reformed by 1 June and that 85 brigades of constant combat preparedness had already been created. Among them are the combined-arms brigade, missile brigades, assault brigades and electronic warfare brigades.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nThe President of Russia is the Supreme Commander-in-Chief of the Armed Forces of the Russian Federation. The Main Command (\"Glavkomat\") of the Ground Forces, based in Moscow, directs activities. This body was disbanded in 1997, but reformed by President Putin in 2001 by appointing Colonel General Nikolai Kormiltsev as the commander-in-chief of the ground forces and also as a deputy minister of defense. Kormiltsev handed over command to Colonel General (later General of the Army) Alexey Maslov in 2004, and in a realignment of responsibilities, the Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief lost his position as a deputy minister of defence. Like Kormiltsev, while serving as Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief Maslov has been promoted to General of the Army.\\n\\nIn January 2014, the acting commander of the Russian Ground Forces is Lieutenant General Sergei Istrakov, who was appointed by Russian president Vladimir Putin upon the dismissal of former commander Colonel General Vladimir Chirkin over corruption charges in December 2013. Istrakov handed over to a new commander on 2 May 2014, Colonel general Oleg Salyukov.\\n\\nThe Main Command of the Ground Forces consists of the Main Staff of the Ground Troops, and departments for Peacekeeping Forces, Armaments of the Ground Troops, Rear Services of the Ground Troops, Cadres of the Ground Troops (personnel), Indoctrination Work, and Military Education. There were also a number of directorates which used to be commanded by the Ground Forces Commander-in-Chief in his capacity as a deputy defence minister. They included NBC Protection Troops of the Armed Forces, Engineer Troops of the Armed Forces, and Troop Air Defence, as well as several others. Their exact command status is now unknown.\\n\\nSection::::Branches of service.\\nThe branches of service include motorized rifles, tanks, artillery and rocket forces, troop air defense, special corps (reconnaissance, signals, radioelectronic warfare, engineering, nuclear, biological and chemical protection, logistical support, automobile, and the protection of the rear), military units, and logistical establishments.\\n\\nThe Motorised Rifle Troops, the most numerous branch of service, constitutes the nucleus of Ground Forces\\' battle formations. They are equipped with powerful armament for destruction of ground-based and aerial targets, missile complexes, tanks, artillery and mortars, anti-tank guided missiles, anti-aircraft missile systems and installations, and means of reconnaissance and control. It is estimated that there are currently 19 motor rifle divisions, and the Navy now has several motor rifle formations under its command in the Ground and Coastal Defence Forces of the Baltic Fleet, the Northeastern Group of Troops and Forces on the Kamchatka Peninsula and other areas of the extreme northeast. Also present are a large number of mobilisation divisions and brigades, known as \"Bases for Storage of Weapons and Equipment\", that in peacetime only have enough personnel assigned to guard the site and maintain the weapons.\\n\\nThe Tank Troops are the main impact force of the Ground Forces and a powerful means of armed struggle, intended for the accomplishment of the most important combat tasks. As of 2007, there were three tank divisions in the force: the 4th and 10th within the Moscow Military District, and 5th Guards \"Don\" in the Siberian MD.\\nThe 2nd Guards Tank Division in the Siberian Military District and the 21st Tank Division in the Far Eastern MD were disbanded.\\n\\nThe Artillery and Rocket Forces provide the Ground Forces\\' main firepower. The Ground Forces currently include five or six static defence machine-gun/artillery divisions and seemingly now one division of field artillery—the 34th Guards in the Moscow MD. The previous 12th in the Siberian MD, and the 15th in the Far Eastern MD, seem to have disbanded.\\n\\nThe Air Defense Troops (PVO) are one of the basic weapons for the destruction of enemy air forces. They consist of surface-to-air missiles, anti-aircraft artillery and radio-technical units and subdivisions.\\n\\nArmy Aviation, while intended for the direct support of the Ground Forces, has been under the control of the Air Forces (VVS) since 2003. However, by 2015, Army Aviation will have been transferred back to the Ground Forces and 18 new aviation brigades will have been added. Of the around 1,000 new helicopters that have been ordered under the State Armament Programmes, 900 will be for the Army Aviation.\\n\\nSection::::Dispositions since 2010.\\nAs a result of the 2008 Russian military reforms, the ground forces now consist of armies subordinate to the four new military districts: (Western, Southern, Central, and Eastern Military Districts). The new districts have the role of \\'operational strategic commands,\\' which command the Ground Forces as well as the Naval Forces and part of the Air and Air Defence Forces within their areas of responsibility.\\n\\nEach major formation is bolded, and directs the non-bolded major subordinate formations.\\nIt is not entirely clear to which superior(s) the four operational-strategic commands will report from 1 December 2010, as they command formations from multiple services (Air Force, Ground Forces & Navy). A current detailed list of the subordinate units of the four military districts can be found in the respective articles. During 2009, all 23 remaining divisions were reorganised into four tank brigades, 35 motor-rifle brigades, one \"prikritiya\" brigade formed from a machinegun-light artillery division, and three airborne-assault brigades (pre-existing). Almost all are now designated \"otdelnaya\" (separate), with only several brigades retaining the guards honorific title.\\n\\nIn 2013, two of these brigades were reactivated as full divisions: the 2nd Guards Tamanskaya Motor Rifle Division and 4th Guards Kantemirovskaya Tank Division. These two divisions marked the beginning of the expansion of the Ground Forces as more brigades are being reformed into full divisions within each military district.\\n\\nSection::::Personnel.\\nIn 2006, the Ground Forces included an estimated total of 395,000 persons, including approximately 190,000 conscripts and 35,000 personnel of the Airborne Forces (VDV).\\nThis can be compared to an estimated 670,000, with 210,000 conscripts, in 1995–96. These numbers should be treated with caution, however, due to the difficulty for those outside Russia to make accurate assessments, and confusion even within the General Staff on the numbers of conscripts within the force.\\n\\nThe Ground Forces began their existence in 1992, inheriting the Soviet military manpower system practically unchanged, though it was in a state of rapid decay. The Soviet Ground Forces were traditionally manned through terms of conscription, which had been reduced in 1967 from three to two years. This system was administered through the thousands of military commissariats ( [\"voyenkomat\"]) located throughout the Soviet Union. Between January and May of each year, every young Soviet male citizen was required to report to the local \"voyenkomat\" for assessment for military service, following a summons based on lists from every school and employer in the area.\\n\\nThe \"voyenkomat\" worked to quotas sent out by a department of the General Staff, listing how many young men were required by each service and branch of the Armed Forces.\\n(Since the fall of the Soviet Union, draft evasion has skyrocketed; officials regularly bemoan the ten or so percent that actually appear when summoned.) The new conscripts were then picked up by an officer from their future unit and usually sent by train across the country. On arrival, they would begin the Young Soldiers\\' course, and become part of the system of senior rule, known as \"dedovshchina\", literally \"rule by the grandfathers.\" There were only a very small number of professional non-commissioned officers (NCOs), as most NCOs were conscripts sent on short courses\\nto prepare them for section commanders\\' and platoon sergeants\\' positions. These conscript NCOs were supplemented by \"praporshchik\" warrant officers, positions created in the 1960s to support the increased variety of skills required for modern weapons.\\n\\nThe Soviet Army\\'s officer-to-soldier ratio was extremely top-heavy, partially in order to compensate for the relatively low education level of the military manpower base and the absence of professional NCOs. Following World\\xa0War\\xa0II and the great expansion of officer education, officers became the product of four-to-five-year higher military colleges. As in most armies, newly commissioned officers usually become platoon leaders, having to accept responsibility for the soldiers\\' welfare and training (with the exceptions noted above). Young officers in Soviet Army units were worked round the clock, normally receiving only three days off per month. Annual vacations were under threat if deficiencies emerged within the unit, and the pressure created enormous stress. Towards the end of the Soviet Union, this led to a decline in morale amongst young officers.\\n\\nIn the early 2000s, many junior officers did not wish to serve—in 2002, more than half the officers who left the forces did so early. Their morale was low, among other reasons because their postings were entirely in the hands of their immediate superiors and the personnel department. \"Without having to account for their actions, they can choose to promote or not promote him, to send him to Moscow or to some godforsaken post on the Chinese border.\"\\n\\nThere is little available information on the current status of women, who are not conscripted, in the Ground Forces. According to the BBC, there were 90,000 women in the Russian Army in 2002, though estimates on numbers of women across the entire Russian armed forces in 2000 ranged from 115,000 to 160,000.\\nWomen serve in support roles, most commonly in the fields of nursing, communications, and engineering. Some officers\\' wives have become contract service personnel.\\n\\nSection::::Contract soldiers.\\nFrom small beginnings in the early 1990s, employment of contract soldiers (\"kontraktniki\") has grown greatly within the Ground Forces, though many have been of poor quality (wives of officers with no other prospective employment, for example). In December 2005, Sergei Ivanov, then Minister of Defence, proposed that—in addition to the numerous enlisted contract soldiers—all sergeants should become professional, which would raise the number of professional soldiers and non-commissioned officers in the Armed Forces overall to approximately 140,000 in 2008. The current programme allows for an extra 26,000 posts for fully professional sergeants.\\n\\nThe CIA reported in the \"World Factbook\" that 30 percent of Russian army personnel were contract servicemen at the end of 2005, and that, as of May 2006, 178,000 contract servicemen were serving in the Ground Forces and the Navy. Planning calls for volunteer servicemen to compose 70 percent of armed forces by 2010, with the remaining servicemen consisting of conscripts. At the end of 2005, the Ground Forces had 40 all-volunteer constant readiness units, with another 20 constant readiness units to be formed in 2006. These CIA figures can be set against IISS data, which reports that at the end of 2004, the number of contracts being signed in the Moscow Military District was only 17 percent of the target figure; in the North Caucasus, 45 percent; and in the Volga-Ural, 25 percent.\\n\\nWhatever the number of contract soldiers, commentators such as Alexander Goltz are pessimistic that many more combat ready units will result, as senior officers \"see no difference between professional NCOs, ...\\xa0versus conscripts who have been drilled in training schools for less than six months. Such sergeants will have neither the knowledge nor the experience that can help them win authority [in] the barracks.\" Defence Minister Sergey Ivanov underlined the in-barracks discipline situation, even after years of attempted professionalisation, when releasing the official injury figures for 2002. 531 men had died on duty as a result of accidents and crimes, and 20,000 had been wounded (the numbers apparently not including suicides). According to Ivanov, \"the accident rate is not falling\". Two of every seven conscripts will become addicted to drugs and alcohol while serving their terms, and a further one in twenty will suffer homosexual rape, according to 2005 reports.\\n\\nPart of the reason is the feeling between contract servicemen, conscripts, and officers. \\n\\nSection::::Equipment.\\nThe Ground Forces retain a very large quantity of vehicles and equipment. There is also likely to be a great deal of older equipment in state military storage, a practice continued from the Soviet Union. However, following the collapse of the USSR, the newly independent republics became host to most of the formations with modern equipment, whereas Russia was left with lower-category units, usually with older equipment. As financial stringency began to bite harder, the amount of new equipment fell as well, and by 1998, only ten tanks and about 30 BMP infantry fighting vehicles were being purchased each year.\\n\\nNew equipment, like the Armata Universal Combat Platform, Bumerang and Kurganets-25 will be equipped from 2015 and replace many old tanks, BMPs, BTRs like T-72, T-90, BMP-1/2/3, BTR-80 in active service.\\nFunding for new equipment has greatly risen in recent years, and the Russian defence industry continues to develop new weapons systems for the Ground Forces.\\nLevel of modern weapons in the Ground Forces is 42 per cent in late 2016. Two Iskander-M missile system brigade sets, over 60 Tornado-G MLRS and more than 20 Msta-SM self-propelled howitzers have been received in 2016. More than 70 upgraded Grad-M MLRS have been fielded too. Russian Land Forces received two brigade sets of Buk-M3 and Buk-M2 air defence missile complexes in 2016. Troops also received two division sets of Tor-M2 and two of Tor-M2U air defence missile complexes. Moreover, the Forces received Verba MANPADS, more than 130 BMP-3 IFVs and BTR-82A APCs as well as more than 20 Tigr-M armored vehicles equipped with the Arbalet-DM combat module. The Ground Troops reportedly received 2,930 new or modernized systems allowing for two missile brigades, two SAM brigades and two SAM regiments, one Spetsnaz brigade, 12 motorized rifle and tank battalions, and three artillery divisions to be reequipped.\\n\\nSection::::Equipment summary.\\nThe following figures are sourced from http://warfare.be. Figures listed as \"Active\" only include equipment that is deemed serviceable and circulated in active service.\\n\\nSection::::Ranks and insignia.\\nThe newly re-emergent Russia retained most of the ranks of the Soviet Army, with some minor changes. The principal difference from the usual Western style is some variation in generals\\' rank titles—in at least one case, Colonel General, derived from German usage. Most of the rank names were borrowed from existing German/Prussian, French, English, Dutch, and Polish ranks upon the formation of Russian regular army in the late 17th century, and have lasted with few changes of title through the Soviet period.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Russian Ground Forces', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1094752'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '3RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10947732', 'text': 'Abraham de Oliveira\\n\\nAbraham de Oliveira (4 May 1880 in Amsterdam – 26 March 1943 in Sobibor extermination camp, General Government (occupied Poland) was a Dutch gymnast who competed in the 1908 Summer Olympics.

He moved to New York City in 1966 and was educated at Dowling College, Adelphi University, and Columbia University. He spent the first decade of his career covering cultural issues, mainly by becoming, in 1968, the first full-time rock journalist of \"The New York Times\" and the first full-time rock writer for any major daily newspaper. According to the Times metropolitan editor Arthur Gelb, he hired Jahn specifically to inaugurate the newspaper\\'s coverage of rock music. One of his first assignments was to cover the Woodstock Festival.\\n\\nJahn wrote more than 200 reviews of performances by rock bands and individual folk and blues artists for the \"New York Times\" between 1968 and 1971. He also wrote a column syndicated by North American Newspaper Alliance, 1967-1970, and The New York Times, 1970-1973. Jahn wrote several works of nonfiction before the mid-1970s, when he switched to writing mystery/suspense fiction, eventually publishing about 50 novels and movie/TV adaptations, under his own name and several pen names. His first mystery novel, \"The Quark Maneuver\", published by Ballantine in 1977, won an Edgar Award in 1978. \\n\\nIn 1982 and using the byline Michael Jahn he began the series \"The Bill Donovan Mysteries\" with \"Night Rituals\".

Although the symptoms subside rapidly, commonly within 1 hour, CU may significantly impair quality of life, especially in relation to sporting activities.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Subtypes.\\nSection::::Sweat hypersensitivity.\\nThis subtype of CU refers to those who are hypersensitive to their own sweat.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nDiagnosis is made by injecting autologous (the person\\'s own) sweat into the skin.\\n\\nSection::::Features.\\nThe hives are observed to coincide with perspiration points of sweating.\\n\\nSection::::Pathophysiology.\\nTanaka et al. found that the sweat hyper-sensitivities of CU and atopic dermatitis seem to be virtually the same, and therefore, the sweat-induced histamine release from basophils may also be mediated by a specific IgE for sweat in atopic dermatitis as well as CU.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Acquired anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis.\\nThis subtype of CU refers to those who have abnormally reduced sweating.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nSweat is readily visualized by a topical indicator such as iodinated starch or sodium alizarin sulphonate. Both undergo a dramatic colour change when moistened by sweat. A thermoregulatory sweat test evaluates the body\\'s response to a thermal stimulus by inducing sweating through the use of a hot box ⁄ room, thermal blanket or exercise. Failure of the topical indicator to undergo a colour change during thermoregulatory sweat testing can indicate anhidrosis and/or hypohidrosis (see Minor test).\\n\\nA skin biopsy may reveal cellular infiltrates in sweat glands or ducts.\\n\\nSection::::Features.\\nSevere heat intolerance (e.g., nausea, dizziness, and headache), and tingling, pricking, pinchy or burning pain over the entire body on exposure to hot environments or prolonged exercise which improve after cooling the body. Occurs in the absence of any causative skin, metabolic, or neurological disorders.\\n\\nSection::::Pathophysiology.\\n The wheals, hypohidrosis, and pain seems to result from the low expression levels of acetylcholinesterase (AchE) and cholinergic receptor, muscarinic 3 (CHRM3) in the eccrine gland epithelial cells.\\n\\nElevated expression levels of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC which result in chemoattracted CD4+ and CD8+ T cell populations to the surrounding area may be responsible for exerting a downmodulatory effect on the AchE and CHRM3 expressions.\\n\\nCorticosteroid inhibits the expressions of CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC. This further support the notion that CCL2/MCP-1, CCL5/RANTES and CCL17/TARC play a crucial role.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Idiopathic.\\nUnknown or unclassified at this time. This represents those who do not fall under any of the above categories.\\n\\nSection::::Prevalence.\\nThough overall research is limited, various studies indicate that CU is relatively common across populations with prevalence rates reportedly ranging from 5% to 20% (depending on locale, race, and age). The condition is more common in young adults, and prevalence appears to peak in adults aged 26–28 (up to 20%). The vast majority of cases are reported to be mild, and proportionally few individuals seek medical attention regarding the condition.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nCU was first described by Duke in 1924 as \"urticaria calorica\". The term \"cholinergic\" is derived from the finding that hives similar to those of CU can be evoked using cholinergic agonists (e.g. methacholine).\\n\\n', 'title': 'Cholinergic urticaria', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10954421'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '4hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '109560', 'text': 'Tildenville, Florida\\n\\nTildenville is a census-designated place (CDP) and an unincorporated area in Orange County, Florida, United States.

Scholars estimate a date in the early 1620s; \"There is a strong case for a late 1624 or early 1625 date for the play.\" The play was entered into the Stationers\\' Register on 14 February 1639, and published in quarto later that year by the bookseller John Waterson; the title page states that it was acted by the King\\'s Men in the Globe Theatre. The quarto also bears Massinger\\'s dedication of the play to a personal friend, Sir Anthony St. Leger (or \"Sentleger\").\\n\\nIn search of a source for Massinger\\'s plot, critics have considered the story of Beatrice Cenci and a passage in Jonson\\'s \"\" that refers to \"incest, murders, rapes...incestuous life.\" Yet it is clear from the thinness of these connections that the plot of the play is \"Massinger\\'s own.\"\\n\\nScholars have studied \"The Unnatural Combat\" for resonances with the events of its era; it has been argued that the play\\'s portrait of its villain Malefort Senior alludes to the sex scandals and witchcraft allegations surrounding George Villiers, 1st Duke of Buckingham. Also, in another possible anti-Buckingham thrust, the play may refer to the failed English expedition to Cadiz (1625); the dedicatee\\'s brother, Sir William St. Leger, was instrumental in the expedition and was critical of Buckingham\\'s conduct of it.\\n\\nThe play\\'s theme of incest has prevented it from gaining any status as a popular or often-revived drama. Nineteenth-century critics tended to condemn \"The Unnatural Combat\" for its sensational aspect; but T. S. Eliot praised the play\\'s \"deft handling of suspense\" and its \"theatrical skill.\"\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nThe play tells the story of the intertwined fates of two families, the Beauforts and Maleforts. Beaufort Senior is the governor of Marseilles in France; his son, Beaufort Junior, is in love with, and beloved by, Theocrine, the daughter of Malefort Senior, the admiral of Marseilles. The admiral\\'s son and Theocrine\\'s half-brother, Malefort Junior, is a successful and notorious pirate; at the start of the play his pirate fleet is blockading the harbor of the city, and his father the admiral is suspected of collusion with the son\\'s actions.\\n\\nThis situation is delineated in the play\\'s opening scene, which proceeds to the admiral\\'s trial before the governor and other officials. Malefort Senior reminds his judges of his many past victories and acts of courage, though to little effect. The trial is then interrupted by an emissary from the pirates, who bears a challenge: Malefort Junior challenges his father to single combat, which will decide the outcome of the pirates\\' siege. Malefort Senior agrees; it is a way for him to clear his reputation and refute the charges against him—but more than that, the challenge satisfies his bloody-minded nature. (This duel, of course, is the \"unnatural combat\" of the title.)\\n\\nMalefort Junior and his captains arrive for the duel. The pirates, talking among themselves, express their surprise at their leader\\'s course of action; they do not comprehend his motives. When Malefort Senior and Junior meet, they converse before the fight — and the son reproaches his father for having committed a \"deed of horror\" (though he doesn\\'t specify the nature of that horrible action). They duel; the father kills the son, and mutilates his body. The pirates withdraw, according to their agreement; Malefort Senior is cleared of the charges against him and hailed once more as the city\\'s hero.\\n\\nPlans are made for the wedding of Beaufort Junior and Theocrine; but their friends note the strange, doting, almost obsessive behavior that Malefort Senior has begun to show toward his daughter. A plan is hatched to distract the admiral at a banquet in his honor, and to take Theocrine aside for a quick marriage ceremony with her fiancé. But Malefort Senior is too suspicious and watchful to be fooled in this way, and he discovers and forestalls the intended ceremony. In a soliloquy, Malefort divulges that he is suddenly plagued with, and almost overcome by, lustful and incestuous desire for his daughter. In his confusion and distress, he appeals to his cynical friend Montreville, the commander of the city\\'s fortress. Malefort asks Montreville to take Theocrine into his custody, and has the man swear to keep them, father and daughter, separate, no matter how Malefort may change his mind, object, or plead to the contrary in the future.\\n\\nMontreville does as Malefort requests, but for his own dark motives; he abducts Theocrine and takes her to his fortress. When Malefort eventually, and inevitably, comes to the fortress to try to get her back, Montreville has her tossed out the front gate, her clothing disordered and hair disheveled; and Montreville cheerfully admits to having raped her. He reminds Malefort that he was once a rejected suitor for Theocrine\\'s hand, and gloats over his revenge. Montreville also reveals the sinister history the two men share, and the nature of the crime with which Malefort Junior had reproached his father on the \"field of honor.\" Years before, Malefort had fallen in love with Montreville\\'s mistress; to marry the woman, Malefort poisoned his first wife, his son\\'s mother. Malefort then married the mistress, who gave birth to Theocrine.\\n\\nTheocrine dies from the shock of her rape. Malefort, in his distraction, sees the ghosts of his son and his murdered first wife. A thunderstorm rises, and Malefort is struck by a bolt of lightning and killed on the spot. The forces of the governor, led by Beaufort Senior and Junior and other officials, assault and take the fortress; Montreville is led away to answer for his crime.\\n\\nThe tragic plot is varied with some elements of comic relief, from two sources. One is a group of Theocrine\\'s servants that includes her Usher, waiting women, and especially her Page; the other, and the more important one, is the figure of Belgarde, a cashiered captain who has to struggle for survival, cadging free meals wherever he can. Belgarde also supplies social commentary on the fates of soldiers and sailors who are no longer needed by society (relevant, perhaps, in the aftermath of the Cadiz campaign).\\n\\n', 'title': 'The Unnatural Combat', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10959108'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10960735', 'text': '1984–85 French Division 1\\n\\nGirondins de Bordeaux won Division 1 season 1984/1985 of the French Association Football League with 59 points.\\n\\n\\nSection::::League table.\\nPromoted from Division 2, who will play in Division 1 season 1985/1986\\n\\n', 'title': '1984–85 French Division 1', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=10960735'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '109616', 'text': 'Pahokee, Florida\\n\\nPahokee is a city located on the shore of Lake Okeechobee in Palm Beach County, Florida, United States.

Such wagons formed part of a wagon train of settlers or fed traveling workers such as cowboys or loggers.\\n\\nIn modern times, chuckwagons feature in certain cooking competitions and events. Chuckwagons are also used in a type of horse racing known as chuckwagon racing. \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nWhile some form of mobile kitchens had existed for generations, the invention of the chuckwagon is attributed to Charles Goodnight, a Texas rancher, the \"father of the Texas Panhandle,\" who introduced the concept in 1866. After the American Civil War, the beef market in Texas expanded. Some cattlemen herded cattle in parts of the country that did not have railroads which would mean they needed to be fed on the road for months at a time. Goodnight modified the Studebaker wagon, a durable army-surplus wagon, to suit the needs of cowboys driving cattle from Texas to sell in New Mexico. He added a \"chuck box\" to the back of the wagon with drawers and shelves for storage space and a hinged lid to provide a flat cooking surface. A water barrel was also attached to the wagon and canvas was hung underneath to carry firewood. A wagon box was used to store cooking supplies and cowboys\\' personal items.\\n\\nChuckwagon food typically included easy-to-preserve items like beans and salted meats, coffee, and sourdough biscuits. Food would also be gathered \"en route\". There was no fresh fruit, vegetables, or eggs available and meat was not fresh unless an animal was injured during the run and therefore had to be killed. The meat they ate was greasy cloth-wrapped bacon, salt pork, and beef, usually dried, salted or smoked. The wagon was also stocked with a water barrel and a sling to kindle wood to heat and cook food. On cattle drives, it was common for the \"cookie\" who ran the wagon to be second in authority only to the \"trailboss.\" The cookie would often act as cook, barber, dentist, and banker.\\n\\nThe term \"chuck wagon\" comes from \"chuck\", a slang term for food, and not from the nickname for \"Charles\".\\n\\nSection::::Cook-offs.\\n \\nThe American Chuckwagon Association is an organization dedicated to the preservation of the heritage of the chuckwagon. Its members participate in chuckwagon cook-offs throughout much of the US. Through these events, the members educate the public on the history and traditions surrounding the chuckwagon.\\n\\nAt a chuckwagon cook off, each wagon is judged on the authenticity of the wagon. Wagons must be in sound drivable condition, with equipment and construction available in the late 1800s. Contents of the chuck-box, including utensils, must also match what would have been used during the era. Wagons are also judged on the attire of their cooks. A typical chuckwagon cookoff is composed of 5 food categories: Meat (usually chicken-fried steak), Beans (pinto), Bread (sourdough or yeast), Dessert (usually peach cobbler), and potatoes. A team of judges evaluates the entries from each wagon, giving each a score. Once scores are tabulated, prizes are awarded to the top wagons.\\n\\nOne of the most famous chuckwagon cook-offs is the Lincoln County Cowboy Symposium. Held annually for some two decades, this event attracts thousands to Ruidoso, New Mexico.\\n\\nAmong the few chuckwagon cook-offs east of the Mississippi River takes place during SaddleUp! each February in Pigeon Forge, Tennessee. Held just outside Great Smoky Mountains National Park, SaddleUp! also features a cowboy symphony and cowboy church services over a four-day period.\\n\\nThe Academy of Western Artists presents an annual award for outstanding chuckwagon cooking as well as honors in other fields relating to the culture of the American cowboy.\\n\\nSection::::Racing.\\nChuckwagon racing is an event at some rodeos mainly in Western Canada such as the Calgary Stampede. Chuckwagon races were held from 1952 until 1998 at Cheyenne Frontier Days, one of America\\'s biggest rodeos. There are a few professional chuckwagon racing circuits that operate in North America with the premiere circuit being run by the World Professional Chuckwagon Association (WPCA) based in Calgary, Alberta, the Western Chuckwagon Association out of Grande Prairie, AB, and Canadian Professional Chuckwagon Association out of Saskatchewan. A yearly chuckwagon race event is still held in Clinton, Arkansas. \\n\\nSo far the world\\'s most successful Chuckwagon champion is Kelly Sutherland, who won the Calgary Stampede 12 times - the Wayne Gretzky of Chuckwagon racing. He inherited this tough pioneering spirit from his grandparents Helen and Seath Sutherland who homesteaded about fifteen miles southwest of Grande Prairie, Alberta. They raised 12 children there and Seath drove a team of horses to deliver coal to feed his family during the depression. This he did after mining a coal seam from the banks of the Wapiti river. \\n\\nChuckwagons are raced around a figure eight barrel obstacle, and the stove and tent poles within the wagon must not be lost. The racing team also has from two to four \"outriders\" who load the stove and tent poles at the start and must finish the race with the chuckwagon. Many such races are held each year in Western Canadian cities and towns.\\n\\nSection::::Animal welfare.\\nChuckwagon racing is highlighted by animal welfare experts as dangerous to the horses, due to the unusually high risk of broken limbs and other bones. Horses die frequently as a result and animal welfare charities are trying to raise awareness about the sport in this light. In July 2011, a horse died in the chuckwagon race on the opening night of the Calgary Stampede.\\n\\nSection::::Chuckwagon suppers.\\nTourists, mostly in the summers, can experience chuckwagon suppers, sometimes followed by live entertainment, at locations across the Western United States.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Chuckwagon', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1096474'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '7RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '10966207', 'text': 'Todd Lowber\\n\\nTodd Lowber (born January 26, 1982) is a former gridiron football wide receiver.

He learned to play the fiddle and flugelhorn in a band led by his father. Later he played these instruments in a military band. He started to compose in the 1920s while he worked as a bartender in a pub owned by his father-in-law. In 1929 he wrote the \"Modřanská polka\" named after Modřany, a suburb of Prague where it was played the first time. This catchy tune became a hit and allowed Vejvoda to pursue music as a full-time professional. It was published in 1934 with lyrics \"Škoda lásky, kterou jsem tobě dala...\" Publishing house Shapiro Bernstein acquired the rights shortly before World War II and the polka, now the \"Beer Barrel Polka\" with the English lyrics \"Roll out the barrel...\", became the most popular song of the Allies in the West, although the original Czech lyrics have a very different meaning and do not speak about beer. After the war this polka became popular around the world, in German-speaking countries as \"Rosamunde\".\\n\\nVejvoda wrote many other hits, such as \"Kdyby ty muziky nebyly\" (\"If those bands did not exist\") and \"Já ráda tancuju\" (\"I love to dance\") but none of them became popular outside of the Czech and German speaking countries.\\n\\nVejvoda had three sons: Jaromír, Jiří and Josef.

In December 2017, iHeartMedia assembled a trimulcast of KBPI along the Interstate 25 corridor on the 107.9 frequency, by moving KBPI\\'s main signal to 107.9 in Fort Collins, as well as to translator station K300CP in Denver, and switching KDZA in Pueblo/Colorado Springs to a simulcast of KBPI.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nKBPI started at 105.9\\xa0MHz in Denver on June 21, 1965. It had studios on the 20th floor of the D&F Tower in downtown Denver. The owner and general manager of the station was Bill Pierson, who named KBPI for \"Bill Pierson Incorporated.\" The station featured a progressive rock format. Pierson sold the station in 1974. The station continued its rock format under the new owner, Progressive Broadcasters, Incorporated.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the station moved to an album-oriented rock (AOR) sound. Its television commercials featured a blonde woman lip synching with bits of popular Rock songs and DJ\\'s voices, and the tagline \"KBPI Rocks the Rockies!\" (elongated with rolling R sounds). This catchphrase is still used in advertising and for a while the campaign was used at other rock radio stations in the United States and Canada. The \"blonde woman\" AKA \"KBPI\\'s Remarkable Mouth\" was Kelly Harmon, sister of actor Mark Harmon.\\n\\nDuring the 1970s, KBPI gained press for inviting people to bring their disco records to the station office for destruction, and this was frequently broadcast live over the air to the tune of Black Sabbath songs. This was commonplace among AOR stations who were riding the anti-Disco theme at the time. For four years, Steven B. and the Hawk ruled the Denver morning FM ratings, mixing rock music with their witty comments and routines. As they put it, \"It really didn\\'t matter what kind of music they played. Listeners tuned in to hear them.\"\\n\\nTheir comedic style was highlighted by a self-deprecating sense of humor, rather than \"shock jock talk.\" The duo ridiculed the entertainment industry, regularly parodying movie and TV stars. One of their favorite routines was an ongoing spoof of soap operas. They created their own ongoing series, whose titles were partially taken from the real shows that aired at the time: \"Edge of Guiding Days of My Children Turning Hospital\". They also did commercials featuring \"Whamco\" products and promotions.\\n\\nDon Hawkins died unexpectedly in November 1994, following a routine surgery. Steven B. Williams, who had become a nationally prominent voiceover artist for television stations and networks including Nick at Nite and moved to California, was found dead of a gunshot wound in May 2006 off Catalina Island, and a business associate who embezzled the inheritance of Williams\\'s father was convicted of his murder in 2011.\\n\\nOn April 20, 1994, Chancellor Media moved KBPI to 106.7 FM, which had been the home of KAZY, its long-time rock competitor and a former sister station to KLZ-AM-TV. Notable DJs include Willie B., DMac, Marc Stout, Scoop, Missy, Uncle Nasty, Matt Need, Double A Ron, Dan, Tim Bourke, Eddie, Joe the Russian and B Lo.\\n\\nSection::::Move to 106.7.\\n106.7 FM signed the air on June 19, 1962 as KLZ-FM. At first it simulcast its AM counterpart, 560 KLZ. But in the early 1970s, it started airing a rock format. In 1977, KLZ-FM changed its call sign to KAZY (now at 93.7 FM in Cheyenne, Wyoming) and continued with a rock format until KBPI moved to the frequency on April 20, 1994 (105.9 would then flip to Hot AC as KALC).\\n\\nDean and Rog hosted the KBPI Morning Show from 1991 to 1996. They were known for features like \"The Birthday Scam\" and \"Torture Tuesday\", as well as other stunts. In 1996, the duo and two other station employees were charged with disorderly conduct for entering a mosque while playing \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" on a bugle and trumpet. This was in response to Nuggets player Mahmoud Abdul-Rauf\\'s refusal to stand for the anthem before games.\\n\\nAfter more than twenty years with a mainstream album rock sound, KBPI shifted to active rock in late 1995, calling its new format \"The New Music Revolution.\" At the time, KBPI had an Alternative rock lean. A few years later, KBPI would bring back the old slogan \"Rocks the Rockies.\"\\n\\nIn 2007, the station was nominated for \"Radio & Records\" Industry Achievement Award for best active rock station in a top 25 market.\\n\\nSection::::Move to 107.9.\\nOn July 27, 1975, 107.9 FM first signed on as KCOL-FM. It was the sister station to AM 1410 KCOL (now on AM 600). KCOL-FM aired a beautiful music format. In 1988, the station switched to a Top 40 format as KIMN, which were the call letters of a popular Top 40 station in Denver in past years. The station took the call letters KPAW in 1995, at first keeping its Top 40 sound, then moving to classic hits around 2000, and later to classic rock.\\n\\nIn December 2017, iHeartMedia launched a trimulcast of KBPI, utilizing the analog 107.9 frequency across several markets in the Interstate 25 corridor. On December 5, the programming and call letters of classic rock KPAW, which targets Fort Collins and the Northern Front Range, was moved to KYWY (92.9) in Cheyenne, Wyoming (which moved its adult contemporary format to KOLT-HD2 (100.7-HD2) and translator station K246CI (97.1) four days prior).\\n\\nOn December 11, KBPI\\'s programming and call letters then moved to the 107.9 frequency vacated by KPAW and co-channel Denver translator K300CP, while sister station KDZA in Pueblo, which also serves Colorado Springs, flipped to a simulcast of KBPI (and switched their calls to KBPL the following month). The previous 106.7 signal, which warehoused the KYWY call letters, simulcasted KBPI for a week before flipping to country as KWBL on December 18, 2017. The move of the station in Denver from the 106.7 full-power signal to a 107.9 translator that barely covers most of Denver proper has been criticized by metro listeners due to reception and audio quality issues.\\n\\nSection::::K300CP history.\\nThe K300CP translator launched early as 2015 in as an FM translator of KOA (850) until November 1, 2015, when KOA was switched to the newly-acquired K231BQ (94.1). After a simulcast of Christmas music from the HD2 subchannel of KRFX (103.5) through the holidays, it began to translate the sports radio format of KDSP (760) until December 11, 2017, when it converted to a simulcast of KPTT-HD2.

There are currently 17 U.S. Civil War soldiers buried in the Geneva Cemetery, 15 of these soldiers served in the confederacy and only 2 served in the union. There were originally 18 soldiers buried, however one soldier’s remains were removed by his family and placed in a different cemetery.\\n\\nEarly schools in Geneva were originally located in the homes of local residents. The first formal school was built in 1874 on land that was also donated by Progar Debogory. A new one-room school was built by 1903 in replacement of the original schoolhouse. In 1924, a new building was built out of bricks and had 4 rooms to accommodate more students. In 1941, principal W.L. Seig developed a unique 4-H program focused on the development of home economics and farming skills. This program was sponsored by Rollins College and this accomplishment is acknowledged and praised in the \"History of the Seminole County Public Schools\". In 1988, an elementary school was built surrounding the old brick schoolhouse. The old schoolhouse was preserved for the community and in 1995 it served as a family resource center.

Form is an external thing, be it ever so good, and\\nthus it may lapse into misuse; but then it is no longer an orderly form,\\nbut a disorder; so that no external order stands and avails at all of\\nitself, as hitherto the papal forma are judged to have done, but all forma\\nhave their life, worth, strength, and virtues in proper use; or else they\\nare of no avail and value whatever\" (Werke, Weimar ed., xix. 72 aqq.).\\nAccording to Lutheran ecclesiastical teaching (Formula of Concord,\\nII; \"Solida declaratio\", x.; Apology, xiv.; Melanchthon\\'s \"Loci\", 2d\\nredaction in \"CR\", xxi. 555-556; the Saxon \"Visitationsbuch\" of 1528; etc.) a\\nuniform liturgy is requisite only in so far as it is indispensable to uphold proper doctrine and the administration of the sacraments; whereas in general the rightful appointment of the external functions of church officers and their sphere in the congregations is committed to the church\\ngoverning board of the state authorities. The spontaneous development of\\nchurch law, and especially the regulation of divine service, the\\nsacraments, and discipline, as Luther ideally conceived it, proved\\nimpracticable, and gave place, though not invariably so, to definition on\\nthe part of temporal sovereigns. All these regulations, especially those of\\ngovernments and cities, by means of which the canonical church forms that\\nhad previously prevailed in the land were modified in a reformatory\\ndirection, while the newly developing church system became progressively\\nestablished, are called \"Church Orders\". Those of the sixteenth century\\nare the most important.\\n\\nA Church Order usually begins with a dogmatic part in which the agreement of the State Church with the general Lutheran confessions is set forth with more or less of detail (\"Credenda\"); then follow regulations concerning\\nliturgy, the appointment of church officers, organization of church government, discipline, marriage, schools, the pay of church and school officials, the administration of church property, care of the poor, etc. (\"Agenda\"). A systematic topical arrangement is by no means always adhered to. As a rule, later compilations have made use of earlier forms,\\nand thus the Orders are grouped in families.\\n\\nSection::::External links.\\n\"Die evangelischen Kirchenordnungen des XVI.

They were discovered in brain extracts in the 1870s and were named after the mythological sphinx because of their enigmatic nature. These compounds play important roles in signal transduction and cell recognition. Sphingolipidoses, or disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, have particular impact on neural tissue. A sphingolipid with an R group consisting of a hydrogen atom only is a ceramide. Other common R groups include phosphocholine, yielding a sphingomyelin, and various sugar monomers or dimers, yielding cerebrosides and globosides, respectively. Cerebrosides and globosides are collectively known as glycosphingolipids.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nThe long-chain bases, sometimes simply known as sphingoid bases, are the first non-transient products of \"de novo\" sphingolipid synthesis in both yeast and mammals. These compounds, specifically known as phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (also known as sphinganine, although this term is less common), are mainly C compounds, with somewhat lower levels of C bases. Ceramides and glycosphingolipids are \"N\"-acyl derivatives of these compounds.\\n\\nThe sphingosine backbone is O-linked to a (usually) charged head group such as ethanolamine, serine, or choline.\\n\\nThe backbone is also amide-linked to an acyl group, such as a fatty acid.\\n\\nSection::::Types.\\nSimple sphingolipids, which include the sphingoid bases and ceramides, make up the early products of the sphingolipid synthetic pathways.\\n\\nComplex sphingolipids may be formed by addition of head groups to ceramide or phytoceramide: \\n\\nSection::::Mammalian sphingolipid metabolism.\\n\"De novo\" sphingolipid synthesis begins with formation of 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine by serine palmitoyltransferase. The preferred substrates for this reaction are palmitoyl-CoA and serine. However, studies have demonstrated that serine palmitoyltransferase has some activity toward other species of fatty acyl-CoA and alternative amino acids, and the diversity of sphingoid bases has recently been reviewed. Next, 3-keto-dihydrosphingosine is reduced to form dihydrosphingosine. Dihydrosphingosine is acylated by a (dihydro)-ceramide synthase, such as Lass1p or Lass2p (also termed as CerS), to form dihydroceramide. This is desaturated to form ceramide.\\n\\nCeramide may subsequently have several fates. It may be phosphorylated by ceramide kinase to form ceramide-1-phosphate. Alternatively, it may be glycosylated by glucosylceramide synthase or galactosylceramide synthase. Additionally, it can be converted to sphingomyelin by the addition of a phosphorylcholine headgroup by sphingomyelin synthase. Diacylglycerol is generated by this process. Finally, ceramide may be broken down by a ceramidase to form sphingosine. Sphingosine may be phosphorylated to form sphingosine-1-phosphate. This may be dephosphorylated to reform sphingosine.\\n\\nBreakdown pathways allow the reversion of these metabolites to ceramide. The complex glycosphingolipids are hydrolyzed to glucosylceramide and galactosylceramide. These lipids are then hydrolyzed by beta-glucosidases and beta-galactosidases to regenerate ceramide. Similarly, sphingomyelin may be broken down by sphingomyelinase to form ceramide.\\n\\nThe only route by which sphingolipids are converted to non-sphingolipids is through sphingosine-1-phosphate lyase. This forms ethanolamine phosphate and hexadecenal.\\n\\nSection::::Functions of mammalian sphingolipids.\\nSphingolipids are commonly believed to protect the cell surface against harmful environmental factors by forming a mechanically stable and chemically resistant outer leaflet of the plasma membrane lipid bilayer. Certain complex glycosphingolipids were found to be involved in specific functions, such as cell recognition and signaling. Cell recognition depends mainly on the physical properties of the sphingolipids, whereas signaling involves specific interactions of the glycan structures of glycosphingolipids with similar lipids present on neighboring cells or with proteins.\\n\\nRecently, simple sphingolipid metabolites, such as ceramide and sphingosine-1-phosphate, have been shown to be important mediators in the signaling cascades involved in apoptosis, proliferation, stress responses, necrosis, inflammation, autophagy, senescence, and differentiation. Ceramide-based lipids self-aggregate in cell membranes and form separate phases less fluid than the bulk phospholipids. These sphingolipid-based microdomains, or \"lipid rafts\" were originally proposed to sort membrane proteins along the cellular pathways of membrane transport. At present, most research focuses on the organizing function during signal transduction.\\n\\nSphingolipids are synthesized in a pathway that begins in the ER and is completed in the Golgi apparatus, but these lipids are enriched in the plasma membrane and in endosomes, where they perform many of their functions. Transport occurs via vesicles and monomeric transport in the cytosol. Sphingolipids are virtually absent from mitochondria and the ER, but constitute a 20-35 molar fraction of plasma membrane lipids.\\n\\nIn experimental animals, feeding sphingolipids inhibits colon carcinogenesis, reduces LDL cholesterol and elevates HDL cholesterol.\\n\\nSection::::Yeast sphingolipids.\\nBecause of the incredible complexity of mammalian systems, yeast are often used as a model organism for working out new pathways. These single-celled organisms are often more genetically tractable than mammalian cells, and strain libraries are available to supply strains harboring almost any non-lethal open reading frame single deletion. The two most commonly used yeasts are \"Saccharomyces cerevisiae\" and \"Schizosaccharomyces pombe\", although research is also done in the pathogenic yeast \"Candida albicans\".\\n\\nIn addition to the important structural functions of complex sphingolipids (inositol phosphorylceramide and its mannosylated derivatives), the sphingoid bases phytosphingosine and dihydrosphingosine (sphinganine) play vital signaling roles in \"S. cerevisiae\". These effects include regulation of endocytosis, ubiquitin-dependent proteolysis (and, thus, regulation of nutrient uptake ), cytoskeletal dynamics, the cell cycle, translation, posttranslational protein modification, and the heat stress response. Additionally, modulation of sphingolipid metabolism by phosphatidylinositol (4,5)-bisphosphate signaling \"via\" Slm1p and Slm2p and calcineurin has recently been described. Additionally, a substrate-level interaction has been shown between complex sphingolipid synthesis and cycling of phosphatidylinositol 4-phosphate by the phosphatidylinositol kinase Stt4p and the lipid phosphatase Sac1p.\\n\\nSection::::Plant sphingolipids.\\nHigher plants contain a wider variety of sphingolipids than animals and fungi.\\n\\nSection::::Disorders.\\nThere are several disorders of sphingolipid metabolism, known as sphingolipidoses. The main members of this group are Niemann-Pick disease, Fabry disease, Krabbe disease, Gaucher disease, Tay–Sachs disease and Metachromatic leukodystrophy. They are generally inherited in an autosomal recessive fashion, but notably Fabry disease is X-linked. Taken together, sphingolipidoses have an incidence of approximately 1 in 10,000, but substantially more in certain populations such as Ashkenazi Jews. Enzyme replacement therapy is available to treat mainly Fabry disease and Gaucher disease, and people with these types of sphingolipidoses may live well into adulthood. The other types are generally fatal by age 1 to 5 years for infantile forms, but progression may be mild for juvenile- or adult-onset forms.\\n\\nSphingolipids have also been implicated with the frataxin protein (Fxn), the deficiency of which is associated with Friedreich\\'s ataxia (FRDA). Loss of Fxn in the nervous system in mice also activates an iron/sphingolipid/PDK1/Mef2 pathway, indicating that the mechanism is evolutionarily conserved. Furthermore, sphingolipid levels and PDK1 activity are also increased in hearts of FRDA patients, suggesting that a similar pathway is affected in FRDA. Other research has demonstrated that iron accumulation in the nervous systems of flies enhances the synthesis of sphingolipids, which in turn activates 3-phosphoinositide dependent protein kinase-1 (Pdk1) and myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) to trigger neurodegeneration of adult photoreceptors.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Sphingolipid', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1100216'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZa3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11004306', 'text': \"Shrinking the footprint\\n\\nShrinking the footprint is a campaign by the Church of England to reduce its carbon footprint.\\n\\nThe campaign is being led by the Bishop of London, Dr Richard Chartres and was launched on World Environment Day in June 2006 with an invitation to all churches to carry out an energy audit and debate energy-related issues.

The population was 4,962 at the 2010 census. Named after one of the founders who contributed a site and paid for the county courthouse, the city was established in 1871, and is the county seat of Dodge County.\\n\\nIn the 19th century, this was a center of the timber and sawmill industry. During the Great Depression in 1937, the first Stuckey\\'s Pecan Shoppe, once well-known along roadways throughout the United States, was founded in Eastman.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe first permanent settlement of the area took place in 1840. The population continued to grow when, in 1869, a station was built for the newly constructed Macon and Brunswick Railroad which passed through the area, stimulating an economic boom. The settlement was originally named Levison and was renamed Eastman by December 1869.\\nEastman was designated as the seat of newly formed Dodge County in 1871. It was incorporated as a town in 1873 and as a city in 1905. Eastman is named for W. P. Eastman, who, with W. E. Dodge, presented the county with a courthouse.\\n\\nDuring that same time period, Ira Roe Foster, former Quartermaster General of Georgia, operated a sawmill in Dodge County. In 1869, Foster built a residence in what would become Eastman. Foster was one of many who came to the area to participate in the timber and sawmill boom.\\n\\nDuring the boom, it was estimated that, on average, there was one mill every two miles along the industrial corridor created by the Macon and Brunswick Railroad. Unlike earlier eras, when timber was transported downstream in large river rafts, sawmills along the industrial corridor shipped their timber by rail. In his book \"The New South Comes to Wiregrass Georgia 1860-1910\", author Mark V. Wetherington states: \"Ira R. Foster shipped lumber to Brunswick, where it was loaded onto timber schooners and transported to international markets like Liverpool, Rio de Janeiro, and Havana.\" When Eastman was incorporated in 1872, Foster served as its first mayor.\\n\\nIn the early years of the 20th century, racial tensions increased between the white and black communities in and about Eastman, resulting in a number of documented lynchings. In one instance, a man misidentified as the rapist Ed Claus was murdered before the real Claus was identified, apprehended, and lynched. In 1919, rumors that local blacks were intending to rise up and exterminate white residents, led to the murder of Eli Cooper and the burning of several black churches, which were believed to be the focal point of the uprising.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nEastman is located in the center of Dodge County at (32.197760, -83.179271).

The first commercial version, Bryce 1.0, appeared in 1994 for the Macintosh.\\n\\nBryce 2.0, shipped in 1996, included much beyond the original notion of creating a realistic mountain range. These included independent light sources, complex atmospheric effects, the addition of primitive forms with Boolean methods to combine them, and a revamped Texture Editor. Bryce 2.0 was also ported to the Windows platform, although the first stable version, 2.1, was not released until 1997.\\n\\nThe ability to animate a scene was added (in a stable form) with the cross-platform Bryce 3D (version 3.1) in 1997 by the newly formed MetaCreations Corporation. A \"camera object\" unseen in the final image acted as the observer. The camera can be held in one place for a single image, or sent on a trajectory with images being rendered at many locations. The collection of images created along the camera\\'s trajectory are combined to create a realistic animation simulating a journey through a dynamic world.\\n\\nIn 1999 Bryce 4.0 was released with major improvements in the handling of atmospheres and skies, textures and also in the import/export of objects.\\n\\nIn 2000 Bryce was purchased by Corel Corporation. Corel released version 5 of Bryce in 2001, which included several new features, like Tree Lab and metaballs. Soon followed a patch to version 5.01, which fixed some bugs and added a few undocumented features.\\n\\nIn 2004, the software was sold again, to DAZ 3D. In 2005, DAZ 3D released Bryce 5.5 which included the DAZ Studio Character plugin. This integration between DAZ\\'s application for the manipulation of 3D models, DAZ Studio, and Bryce allowed users to import content from DAZ Studio and Poser, complete with all materials including transparencies, directly into Bryce thus making it easier to have human figures in Bryce scenes.\\n\\nIn October 2006, DAZ 3D released Bryce 6.0 and has released an update (6.1), this includes a Mac Intel compatible update. New features include animation import, support for dual-processor systems as well as hyper-threading, random replicate tool, advanced terrain editing, HDRI support and other tweaks. The interface remained largely the same, but with a green tint to it, and different buttons in the create palette.\\n\\nIn June 2007, DAZ 3D re-released Bryce 5.5 as a freeware.\\n\\nIn Summer 2009, DAZ 3D released version 3 of DAZ Studio. This version seemed to break Bryce 6.1.\\n\\nIn December 2009, DAZ 3D released Bryce 6.3 which improved stability, and added support for Mac OS X v10.6.\\n\\nBryce 7 was released in July 2010. New features include the Instancing Lab and advanced lighting. Updated features include the DAZ Studio Bridge, the Sky Lab, clouds and HDRI. Bryce 7 is available in three versions, a limited free version, a standard version lacking the new features and a pro version with the new features. Bryce 7 is not currently compatible with OS X Lion (10.7), Mountain Lion (10.8), or Mavericks (10.9) (except for Bryce 7 Personal Limited Edition 7.1.0.74), thus the newest version of OS X it is compatible with is Snow Leopard (10.6).\\n\\nSection::::Features.\\nBryce 7 features:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Bryce (software)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1100885'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1101071', 'text': 'ITAA\\n\\nITAA may refer to the following:\\n\\n', 'title': 'ITAA', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1101071'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'BhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11011327', 'text': 'California Hard\\n\\nCalifornia Hard is a jazz album by pianist and composer Dolo Coker, recorded in 1976.

Dharamshala is the administrative headquarters of the district. It is the home of the Masrur Temples, also known as the Himalayan Pyramids.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nKangra is known for having the oldest serving Royal Dynasty in the world, the Katoch. In 1758, Raja Ghamand Chand\\nwas appointed \"nazim\" or governor of Jullundur Doab under the Afghans. Ghamand Chand was a brave and strong ruler who restored the prestige of Kangra. As he was unable to capture Kangra fort, he built another fort at Tira Sujanpur on the left bank of the Beas, almost opposite to Alampur on a hill overlooking the town. He died in 1774 and was succeeded by his son, Tegh Chand, who died too soon in 1775. Kangra was annexed by Maharaja Ranjit Singh’s Sikh Empire in 1810. Kangra became a district of British India in 1846, when it was ceded to British India at the conclusion of the First Anglo-Sikh War. The British district included the present-day districts of Kangra, Hamirpur, Kullu, and Lahul and Spiti. Kangra District was part of the British province of Punjab. The administrative headquarters of the district were initially at Kangra, but were moved to Dharamshala in 1855.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nAccording to the 2011 census Kangra district has a population of 1,507,223, roughly equal to the nation of Gabon or the US state of Hawaii. This gives it a ranking of 331st in India (out of a total of 640). The district has a population density of . Its population growth rate over the decade 2001–2011 was 12.56%. Kangra has a sex ratio of 1013 females for every 1000 males, and a literacy rate of 86.49%.\\n\\nDistrict Highlights of 2011 Census\\n\\nThe native people are the Kangri people and the native language is Kangri, which is very similar to Dogri. The majority of the people are Hindu Brahmin, Rajput, Chaudhary, Banias and SC/OBC, although many Tibetans and others who follow Buddhism have also settled here recently. There are also minority populations of Sikhs, Muslims, and Christians.\\n\\nJhamakda is a folk dance of Kangra. It is exclusively performed by women. It features percussion instruments and songs.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Climate.\\nIt is situated in Western Himalayas between latitude 31°2΄-32°5΄ N,longitude 75°-75°45΄ E. The elevation above the sea level of Kangra district is in the range of 427 to 6,401 meters. The district is spread over 5,739\\xa0km having about 216643 hectare of land, out of which 195738 hectare is under cultivation. In this district, river Beas flows through distance of 94.00\\xa0km. The soil characteristic is both sandy & loamy. The climate of district is pleasant around the year except in plains like Nurpur, Indora, Fatehpur areas where temperature may raise up to 40° C in the month of May/June.

In 1949, he graduated from Indiana University with a degree in business administration and accepted a job with a development company in Akron. In 1955, he and his brother, David H. Jacobs, started a general contracting company that concentrated on the building of small strip malls. The company grew rapidly and by 1992, the Jacobs Group ranked fourth in the nation in the development and management of enclosed malls owning 40 malls in 16 states outright; they also owned 31 Wendy’s fast-food restaurants and several Marriott hotels. The Jacobs Group company builds and leases shopping centers, offices, and hotels. Among its properties are Key Tower and Westgate Mall in Cleveland, Ohio, and Triangle Town Center in Raleigh, North Carolina. His company also built Westland Mall, Northland Mall, and Eastland Mall in Columbus, Ohio.\\n\\nAlong with his brother, Jacobs was also well known for owning the Cleveland Indians of Major League Baseball (MLB) from 1986 to 1999. Progressive Field, formerly Jacobs Field, in Cleveland bore his family name from its opening in 1994 until early 2008. Jacob\\'s tenure as Indians owner marked one of the team\\'s most successful periods, having reached the World Series on two occasions (1995, and 1997), and winning divisional championships in five consecutive seasons (1995-1999).\\n\\nJacobs also owned the Pier House Resort on Duval Street in Key West, Florida.

Produced by Leonard Cohen and Henry Lewy, it was a return to Cohen\\'s acoustic folk music after the Phil Spector experimentation of \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\", but now with many jazz and Oriental influences.\\n\\nSection::::Recording and composition.\\nAfter recording \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\" with Phil Spector, a chaotically recorded album that would garner Cohen the worst reviews of his career, the singer decided to produce his next album himself with assistance from Henry Levy, a German who had previously worked regularly with Joni Mitchell. The album included Gypsy violin player Raffi Hakopian, English string arranger Jeremy Lubbock, Armenian oud player (located in Los Angeles) John Bilezikjian and even a Mexican Mariachi band. Long-time Cohen collaborator Jennifer Warnes appeared prominently in vocal tracks. Members of the band Passenger, whom Cohen also met through Mitchell, played on four of the songs. Garth Hudson of The Band also appeared on the album.\\n\\nUnlike the psychodrama evident on the Spector-dominated \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\", \"Recent Songs\", which was recorded at A&M Studios in Hollywood in the spring of 1979, sounds lucid by comparison. In the book \"Leonard Cohen: A Remarkable Life\", oud player John Bilezikjian recalls to author Anthony Reynolds, \"Sessions started in the afternoon and we\\'d go into the evenings. No drinking, that I saw, no visitors. Finished at a reasonable time, no early hours stuff...He let me do whatever it was I wanted to do. He trusted my sense of musicality. He would be with a microphone and headphones and we\\'d all be wired up in our separate booths and we\\'d listen and add our part.\" The album had a largely acoustic, Eastern-tinged flavor and was augmented by the singing of Jennifer Warnes and newcomer Sharon Robinson, who would go on to become one of Cohen\\'s favorite musical collaborators.\\n\\n\"Came So Far For Beauty\" originated from Cohen\\'s collaboration with \"New Skin for the Old Ceremony\" producer John Lissauer for a project called \"Songs For Rebecca\", which was scrapped (Lissauer received co-writing credit). In the liner notes to the album, Cohen thanks his Zen Master Roshi for inspiring one of the songs: \"I owe my thanks to Joshu Sasaki upon whose exposition of an early Chinese text I based \\'Ballad of the Absent Mare.\\'\" The metaphoric lyrics are based on the twelfth-century \"Ten Bulls\" (or \"Ten Ox-herding Pictures\"). According to Anthony Reynolds 2010 Cohen memoir, \"The Guests\" was based on a 13th-century Persian poem and was chosen to open the album because of the enthusiastic response it had evoked when Cohen played it to friends. The album also features Cohen\\'s interpretation of \"Un Canadien errant\", a song written in 1842 by Antoine Gérin-Lajoie after the Lower Canada Rebellion of 1837–38. Curiously, Cohen and Levy opted to use a Mexican Mariachi band on the song, which is arguably the only cheerful sonic outburst on what is otherwise a languid album (the Mariachi band is also employed more subtly on \"The Guests\" and \"The Ballad of the Absent Mare\"). Cohen\\'s 2004 song \"The Faith\" is based on the same folk tune a \"Un Canadien errant,\" with Cohen\\'s collaborator Anjani Thomas acknowledging in a 2005 interview (Old Ideas: Notes on \"Dear Heather\") that he used an alternate 1979 track for \"Un Canadien errant\", adding a new vocal line with completely new lyrics, for his 2004 album \"Dear Heather\". Cohen also recorded a studio version of the disco-infused \"Do I Have to Dance All Night,\" which had been previously released as a live single in France in 1976, but it was not included on the album.\\n\\nThe musicians who recorded \"Recent Songs\" with Cohen served as his tour band later that year, highlights of which can be heard on the 2001 release \"\". Cohen performed several songs from the LP in concert, such as \"The Guests,\" \"The Window,\" and the Sinatraesque \"The Smokey Life.\" Speaking with \"Mojo\"\\'s Sylvie Simmons in 2001, Cohen was effusive in his praise for the album:\\n\\nThe painting of Cohen on the album cover is by the artist Dianne Lawrence. \"The Guests\" would be the opening song of Cohen\\'s 1983 made-for-TV short musical \"I Am a Hotel\", which would also feature \"The Gypsy\\'s Wife\" as part of the narration.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\n\"Recent Songs\" received warm reviews and was viewed as a return to form by many critics after the shocking \"Death of a Ladies\\' Man\". At the time of the album\\'s release, \"The New York Times\" said it provided \"an ideal musical idiom for his idiosyncrasies\" and listed it among its top ten records of 1979. In the original 1980 \"Rolling Stone\" review, Debra Rae Cohen enthused, \"There\\'s not a cut on \"Recent Songs\" without something to offer...and at least four or five tunes are full-fledged masterpieces. I wish I had a tape loop of \"The Guests,\" which features a hold-your-breath, haunting melody.\" William Ruhlmann of Allmusic observes, \"His writing had become increasingly bitter and angry during the 1970s in the books \"The Energy of Slaves\" and \"Death of a Lady\\'s Man\" as well as in his lyrics, but there was a new equanimity in these \"Recent Songs\" that began with the welcoming introduction of \\'The Guests\\'...The album was full of references to absence and dislocation, but Cohen deliberately countered them with humor.\" Cohen biographer Anthony Reynolds takes a dim view of the collection, writing in 2010, \"For all its artistry, \"Recent Songs\" sounded bland and MOR...the album as a whole ploughed a self-indulgent, middling trough.\" The LP peaked at # 24 in Austria (where it went gold) and hit #56 in Germany.\\n\\nSection::::Cover versions.\\n\"Ballad of the Absent Mare\" has been covered by several artists, notably Emmylou Harris on the album \"Cowgirl\\'s Prayer\" (as \"Ballad of a Runaway Horse\") and Perla Batalla feat. David Hidalgo on the album \"Bird on the Wire: the Songs of Leonard Cohen\". Martha Wainwright performs a cover version of the song \"The Traitor\" in the tribute film \"\". Nana Mouskouri has covered the song on several albums (\"Song for Liberty\", \"Vivre Avec Toi\", \"I\\'ll Remember You\", \"The Rose\") and also sung the song in translation, for instance as \"Das Fest\" on her German language album \"Ich hab gelacht, ich hab geweint\".

The battalion was organized and under the command of only three captains. The other officers that were supplied to the unit were second lieutenants from the 1943 class of West Point. Shortly after, the battalion participated in two maneuvers in Louisiana, known as the \"Louisiana Maneuvers\"; there the battalion and its soldiers learned valuable lessons for war.\\n\\nThe 249th sailed from the United States to England in May 1944, after equipping and preparing for combat, the Unit landed on Utah Beach in August 1944 under the 1137th Engineer Combat Group commanded by Colonel George A. Morris. In October through November 1944, the soldiers were specially trained on using the Bailey bridge in Trier, France.\\n\\nLater that year on 18 December 1944, the Black Lions were ordered to move from the Saar River, where the unit was building a bridge, to the Ardennes, commonly called the Battle of the Bulge. Upon arriving to the front, the 249th was assigned to the 26th Infantry Division, already engaged and in defensive positions along the southeast corner of the Bulge. The battalion was used in an effort to block the German advance by deploying landmines, obstacles and establishing roadblocks.\\n\\nOn 24 December 1944, Brigadier General Harlan Harkness, the assistant division commander, ordered the battalion to advance and secure the towns of Arsdorf and Bigonville to the north of the 26th Infantry Division, near the area of operations of the 4th Armored Division, in order to relieve the occupied towns so the division could advance and attack the enemy line. Companies A and C were ordered into the town of Arsdorf where the battalion was engaged in fierce combat for two days. It was later learned that the town had never been secured by the 4th Armored Division.\\n\\nIn February 1945, the battalion was selected for the special task of crossing the Rhine River. On 19 March 1945, the unit was assigned to the engineer task force charged with crossing the Rhine at Oppenheim. The main thrust of the effort was to use assault boats to get troops from 5th Infantry Division across and later to construct a more stable pontoon bridge. The battalion met little resistance across the river and quickly began constructing the bridge. After an accident resulting in a raft being sunk, the Battalion moved downriver to Mainz. After this bridge site was secure, the 249th was detached from the 1137th Engineer Group and was given the mission to secure and maintain the bridges on the Rhine River. In May 1945, when the war ended in Europe, the battalion was moved to Plattling, Germany where they built a camp for displaced refugees. In November 1945, the 249th Engineers were sent on their final orders to Camp Lucky Strike, near Marseilles, France and then redeployed back to the United States. The division was inactivated at Camp Patrick Henry, Virginia on 27 November 1945.\\n\\nSection::::Post World War II.\\nIn late 1954, the Black Lion Battalion was withdrawn from the Reserves and assigned to the Regular Army. In February 1955, it was activated and assigned to USAREUR and an Engineer Battalion (Combat Heavy). From 1955 until 1960, the 249th Engineer Battalion (Construction) was stationed at Kleber Kaserne, ((Kaiserslautern, Germany)). Then it was dispatched to France for a time. Then the battalion was stationed at Gerszewski Barracks, Knielingen, Karlsruhe, Germany, under the command of the 18th Engineer Brigade, where it provided construction support to USAREUR elements stationed in Germany for the Cold War.\\n\\nSection::::As a prime power battalion.\\nIn 1994, the battalion was reactivated and designated as the 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power), stationed at Fort Belvoir, VA.\\n\\nSection::::9/11.\\nImmediately after the attacks on the World Trade Center on 11 September 2001, elements of the 249th were deployed to New York City and were instrumental in restoring power to Wall Street enabling the financial district to resume operations within a week of the attack.\\n\\nSection::::Global War on Terrorism.\\nThe 249th Engineer Battalion (Prime Power) provides oversight on all coalition operating base power projects in Iraq (Operation Iraqi Freedom) and Afghanistan (Operation Enduring Freedom).\\n\\nSection::::Hurricane Katrina.\\nThe 249th deployed teams to the Gulf Region under Joint Task Force Katrina, working with contractors, and local and state entities to assess, they helped install and maintain emergency generators at critical facilities.

All of these routes were ultimately converted to rubber tire bus operations, and many were consolidated, extended into newly developed areas, or otherwise reconfigured to keep up with the ridership demands of the times. Additional routes and extensions were added in later years to serve newly developed communities and to feed into Metro and Light Rail stations.\\n\\nWith the growth in popularity of the private automobile during the 20th century, streetcar and bus ridership declined, and the needs for public transportation changed. Mass transit in Baltimore and other cities shifted from a corporate operation to a tax-subsidized, state-run service. The amount of service provided was greatly reduced. Some areas once served by streetcars are now served minimally by buses or not at all.\\n\\nThe demise of the Baltimore streetcar took place between the years of 1947 and 1963, hastened by National City Lines' acquisition, which said that buses offered lower maintenance and had greater flexibility in traffic.

The company was purchased in 1948 by National City Lines and the streetcar system was then run down in favor of buses, a process repeated in many places, which became known as the Great American Streetcar Scandal. The last streetcar ran in 1963. BTCO was absorbed by what is now the Maryland Transit Administration in 1970. The BTC oversaw the elimination of streetcar service in favor of bus service in 1963 when the last streetcar routes, the number 8 providing service from Catonsville to Towson and the number 15 (Overlea to Walbrook Junction) were eliminated.\\n\\nIn the midst of the Civil Rights Movement, the BTCO fired a white bus driver who claimed to be the Grand Wizard of the Baltimore Ku Klux Klan.

A part of the uppermost portion of the river channel was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1966.\\n\\nSection::::Geological history.\\nLake Agassiz was formed from the meltwaters of the Laurentide Ice Sheet during the Wisconsin glaciation of the last ice age. Agassiz was an enormous body of water, up to deep, and at various times covering areas totaling over . Blocked by an ice sheet to the north, the lake water rose until about 13,500 BP calibrated (11,700 C uncalibrated) years ago when it overtopped the \"Big Stone Moraine\", a ridge of glacial drift left by the receding glacier, at the location of Browns Valley, Minnesota. The lake\\'s outflow was catastrophic, and carved a gorge through the moraine wide and deep, which is now known as the Traverse Gap. The channel through the moraine, between Lake Traverse and Big Stone Lake, is now crossed by the divide between the watersheds of the Gulf of Mexico and Hudson Bay. Its significance was recognized by designation as a National Natural Landmark under the Historic Sites Act.\\n\\nFrom Traverse Gap issued Glacial River Warren. From its inception until final abandonment of Agassiz\\' southern outlet, this stream drained the meltwater of that lake to the Mississippi valley. The drainage was not continuous, as Lake Agassiz periodically had other outlets. The Laurentide ice sheet retreated and advanced with climatic variations and these changes in ice cover contributed to isostatic adjustments in the level of the land over which the watercourses ran. These changes in turn uncovered or blocked the lake\\'s other outlets to the sea.\\n\\nSection::::Course.\\nWhile active this turbulent stream cut and eroded a bed up to wide and deep. This has left a valley which starts at Traverse Gap near Browns Valley, Minnesota, goes southeast to Mankato, then turns northeast to the Twin Cities. River Warren was joined by the comparatively small Mississippi at Fort Snelling, from which the valley continues northeast to present-day Saint Paul, where the massive River Warren Falls once graced the landscape. Over 1700 years this waterfall retreated upstream and undercut the Mississippi at the site of Fort Snelling. The falls then split. The Mississippi falls migrated upstream to form Saint Anthony Falls and create Minnehaha Falls in Minneapolis. The River Warren falls receded west in the Minnesota River valley until they reached an older buried river valley about west of the confluence, where the falls were extinguished.\\n\\nFrom Saint Paul the great valley goes southeast to Prescott, Wisconsin, where it is joined by the St. Croix River, itself once the outlet of another proglacial lake, Glacial Lake Duluth which occupied the western part of Lake Superior. From its confluence with the St. Croix the valley continues southeast along the Minnesota-Wisconsin border. River Warren\\'s effects include the creation of bluffs along the valleys of the Minnesota and Mississippi Rivers, and contributed to the formation of Lake Pepin.\\n\\nSection::::Disappearance.\\nBy about 9400 BP, the ice sheet finally retreated sufficiently far to the north that Lake Agassiz permanently took another outlet and receded below the level of Traverse Gap. River Warren then ceased to run. The Lake Agassiz area watershed now feeds the Red River of the North which flows north, ultimately to Hudson Bay. River Warren\\'s upper valley in the Traverse Gap is now occupied by the tiny Little Minnesota River, which flows into Big Stone Lake and the Minnesota River, which follows the greater river\\'s ancient bed to its confluence with the Mississippi River.

It was an expression of Manifest Destiny but it never went into effect. The United States only took the underpopulated districts in the far North of Mexico via the Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo with Mexico, following the Mexican–American War of 1846-48.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nBefore James Polk took office in 1845, the United States Congress approved the annexation of Texas. Polk wished to gain control of a portion of Texas, which had declared independence from Mexico in 1836, but was still being claimed by Mexico. This paved the way for the outbreak of the Mexican–American War on April 24, 1846. With American success on the battlefield, by the summer of 1847 there were calls for the annexation of \"All Mexico\", particularly among Eastern Democrats, who argued that bringing Mexico into the Union was the best way to ensure future peace in the region.\\n\\nSection::::Controversies.\\nThe proposal to annex all of Mexico was controversial. Idealistic advocates of manifest destiny like John L. O\\'Sullivan had always maintained that the laws of the United States should not be imposed on people against their will. The annexation of \"All Mexico\" would be a violation of this principle. The annexation of all Mexico also found controversy in extending U.S.\\xa0citizenship to millions of Mexicans.\\n\\nThis debate brought to the forefront one of the contradictions of manifest destiny: on the one hand, while identitarian ideas inherent in manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans, as non-whites, would present a threat to white racial integrity and thus were not qualified to become U.S. citizens, the \"mission\" component of manifest destiny suggested that Mexicans would be improved (or \"regenerated\", as it was then described) by bringing them into American democracy. Identitarianism was used to promote manifest destiny, but, as in the case of Calhoun and the resistance to the \"All Mexico\" movement, identitarianism was also used to oppose manifest destiny. Conversely, proponents of annexation of \"All Mexico\" regarded it as an anti-slavery measure. Many U.S. nationals were troubled by the Catholicism of Mexico, the weakness of Republicanism there, and the threat of an upsurge of Mexican nationalism.\\n\\nSection::::End of the Call.\\nThe controversy was eventually ended by the Mexican Cession, which added the territories of Alta California and Nuevo México to the United States, both more sparsely populated than the rest of Mexico. Like the All Oregon movement, the All Mexico movement quickly abated. \\n\\nHistorian Frederick Merk, in \"Manifest Destiny and Mission in American History: A Reinterpretation\" (1963), argued that the failure of the All Oregon and All Mexico movements indicates that manifest destiny had not been as popular as historians have traditionally portrayed it to have been. Merk wrote that, while belief in the beneficent mission of democracy was central to American history, aggressive \"continentalism\" was an aberration supported by only a minority of Americans, mostly Democrats, while it was opposed by Whigs and some Democrats. Thus the Democrats of Louisiana opposed annexation of Mexico, while those in Mississippi supported it.\\n\\n', 'title': 'All of Mexico Movement', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1104346'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11044950', 'text': 'Beit Hanan\\n\\nBeit Hanan () is a moshav in central Israel.

Formed in 1993 in the Cleveland Warehouse District, the band is known for their avant-garde sound which includes influence from heavy metal, art rock and electro-industrial and their imagery which features masks and costumes as well as their unique live shows usually performed at smaller venues. Mushroomhead has sold over 2 million units worldwide, and has made 7 studio albums and 15 music videos. Over their lifetime, Mushroomhead has gone through many changes in band lineups, with drummer Steve Felton being the only consistent member.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::\"Mushroomhead\", \"Superbuick\" and \"M3\" (1993–2000).\\nIn 1993, Mushroomhead was established as a side project. To differentiate itself from the members\\' existing bands and to dispel any misconceptions about the group\\'s sound and musical content, Mushroomhead used costumes, masks, and pseudonyms. Mushroomhead played its first show in 1993. Days later, the octet found itself on stage alongside established metal band GWAR. \"We played our first show on a Saturday\" said the band\\'s drummer, Skinny, in an article for Mushroomhead\\'s official website. “Three days later, we got a call to play with GWAR at the Cleveland Agora in front of 2,000 people – our second show ever!”.\\n\\nIn 1995, Mushroomhead released a self-financed debut album, \"Mushroomhead\", with their own record label, Filthy Hands Co. (previously known as Shroomco Records and later on, MRH Records). For the members, Mushroomhead became a priority with their original bands breaking-up. Although the line-up saw many changes throughout the 1990s, the band stayed active, steadily releasing music and gaining followers. In 1996, they released \"Superbuick\". In 1999, Mushroomhead released \"M3\", which was the final album self-financed and self-released by the band.\\n\\nSection::::\"XX\" and \"XIII\" (2000–2005).\\nIn 2001, Mushroomhead released a compilation album titled \"XX\" on the independent label Eclipse Records. Later in the year, after quickly selling almost 40,000 copies in just 2–3 months, the band signed with major label Universal Records and the compilation was remastered and re-released internationally. The release of the album led Mushroomhead to major national and international tours including Ozzfest 2002; as well as television exposure via their first music video \"Solitaire/Unraveling\". Also in 2001, guitarist J.J. Righteous was replaced by one of the band\\'s previous stage dancers & then current sampler, Marko Vukcevich. 2003 saw the release of \"XIII\", their first album with new material for Universal Records. The album produced the single \"Sun Doesn\\'t Rise\" which was featured on \"MTV: Headbangers Ball\" and the \"Freddy vs Jason\" soundtrack. Also featuring the hidden track \"Crazy\", a song originally by Seal. The album debuted at no. 40 on the \"Billboard\" Top 200 charts and sold 400,000 copies worldwide.\\n\\nAfter an extensive world tour, vocalist J Mann announced he was leaving the band in August 2004, citing exhaustion and to take care of his sick father. He was replaced by Three Quarters Dead singer, Waylon. In August 2005, Mushroomhead self-released its first DVD on its own Filthy Hands label – \"Volume 1\". Produced, directed, shot, and edited by the band, Volume 1 covers the band\\'s rise in the 2000s with live performances, music videos, and behind the scenes footage.\\n\\nWhile on the road in 2005, Mushroomhead began the process of writing new material and recording a new album. In December 2005, Mushroomhead signed with Megaforce Records, ensuring the new album\\'s availability nationally and internationally. On June 6, 2006, Mushroomhead launched Mushroom Kombat – an interactive flash feature as a part of the band\\'s official website. The mini-game pits band members against each other in a Mortal Kombat-style environment, with each member having a unique fatality.\\n\\nMushroomhead headlined with Dope, Nocturne, and New Orleans locals Invain on the Music For Freedom Tour sponsored by Jägermeister at the House of Blues in New Orleans, Louisiana on Tuesday, August 16, 2005. This show was one of the last big acts to play in New Orleans for a long time due to Hurricane Katrina striking New Orleans on August 29, 2005.\\n\\nSection::::\"Savior Sorrow\" and \"Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children\" (2005–2012).\\n\"Savior Sorrow\" was released on September 19, 2006, and debuted at No.\\xa045 on the \"Billboard\" 200 charts with sales exceeding 12,000. The band\\'s label stated that sales were closer to 25,000 with the inclusion of sales made while on tour. As a result, SoundScan issued an apology the day following the release of sales data due to mistakes made in estimates. The primary reason given was the lack of inclusion of sales from the Best Buy retailer chain. Sales of Savior Sorrow were roughly 26,000 and the chart entry place was closer to the No.\\xa030 spot than No.\\xa073. Savior Sorrow\\'s chart position was later officially adjusted to No.\\xa050. \"Simple Survival\", the pre-released single to Savior Sorrow, was placed at No.\\xa039 on the Billboard Mainstream Rock Tracks chart one week after the release. Also in 2006, Daniel Fox (Lil\\' Dan) joined the band as a touring drummer.\\n\\nThe band has performed three shows on the Mayhem Festival tour, filling in for Bullet for My Valentine. Live footage was compiled into the band\\'s second DVD, titled \"Volume 2\". On December 29, 2007, Mushroomhead won Video of the Year 2007 on the MTV2 Headbanger\\'s Ball for \"12 Hundred\" from the Savior Sorrow record. On September 17, 2008, it was announced that the band will release the \"Volume 2\" DVD on October 28 through Filthy Hands/Megaforce Records. The disc features two and a half hours of content, including live footage from the three-year Savior Sorrow tour, music videos including \"12 Hundred\", \"Simple Survival\", \"Burn\", the short video for \"Tattoo\", \"Save Us\" and \"Embrace the Ending\", video commentary and behind the scenes footage. To support the DVD, Mushroomhead hit the road with The Autumn Offering, XFactor1, and Human Factors Lab from October 3 in Findlay, Ohio, until November 2 in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. After the tour, Mushroomhead returned to the studio to record their next album.\\n\\nThey released \"Beautiful Stories for Ugly Children\" in September 2010. Within the first week of its release, it became the No.\\xa01 best selling metal album on iTunes. A new song, \"Your Soul Is Mine,\" appeared on the \"Saw VI Soundtrack\". On October 1, 2010, a music video for \"Come On\" debuted on \"Headbangers Ball\" on MTV. The video has since been barred from airing on MTV and other television outlets after being deemed too graphic by network censors. On October 28, 2010, the band\\'s founding guitarist, JJ Righteous, died of unknown reasons at the age of 41.\\n\\nIn October 2010, following the death of ex bandmate JJ Righteous, J Mann appeared on stage with the band during their Halloween show, performing vocals for two songs alongside both Jeffrey Nothing and Waylon. Both he and Waylon made a point of announcing that there were no hard feelings between the two of them, and that they are in fact on good terms with each other. On October 5, 2010, the Professional Wrestling Promotion known as TNA (Total Nonstop Action Wrestling) (Now called \"Impact Wrestling\") used their hit single \"Come On\" as the theme song to promote a match between Ric Flair and Mick Foley, a confrontation that was 20 years in the making. The promotional video can be seen on the TNA Wrestling official YouTube Channel. It is said that a longtime fan of the band put that together for them.\\n\\nIn February 2012, it was announced that guitarist Gravy and bassist Pig Benis would be replaced by Tommy Church and Ryan Farrell respectively. In April 2012, Dave \"Gravy\" Felton stated publicly on his Facebook fan page that he was \"kicked out of the band.\" In May 2012, Daniel \"Lil Dan\" Fox left Mushroomhead to work for another band. It was rumored that he is working as a drum technician for Marilyn Manson. On May 22, Dave Felton posted on his fan page an interview about his latest band. In the interview, he was asked about the Mushroomhead split. He said that he was kicked out via email and that it was the third time he had been told to leave. He said that he thought one of the reasons was because he did not have a party mentality (drinking and smoking) and that he thought it sometimes got in the way of band progress. The interview was on Uncensored Net Noise on the Msc Radio Network LLC. Drum tech Jeremiah Stratton (also known from Hed PE) had taken over Fox\\'s percussion parts in the Hed 2 Head Tour 3. After the Hed 2 Head Tour ended, drum tech Elliot Mapes took over Fox\\'s drum parts for live shows. People have jokingly called him \"Tall E\" in reference to Fox\\'s nickname being \"Lil Dan\". On Thursday, August 16, 2012, Mushroomhead stated on their official Facebook fan page that former member Bronson would return on guitar for their 2012 \"Old School Show\".\\n\\nSection::::\"The Righteous & the Butterfly\", return of J Mann and departure of Waylon Reavis and Jeffrey Nothing (2012–present).\\nIn September 2012, Mushroomhead announced that they are currently in the studio working on new music via their Facebook fan page. It was said by Mushroomhead frontman Jeff Hatrix that former Slipknot and current Painface vocalist Anders Colsefni is in the works to do a recording together in their upcoming studio sessions. The band entered their own Filthy Hands Studio in December 2012 to begin writing and recording their next studio album.\\n\\nTheir eighth album was the only one to showcase all three vocalists. Drummer Steve Felton described it as \"very energetic, dark and by far their heaviest album to date, just a fresh spin on the same old thing if you will. This is the first record with Church on guitar and Farrell on bass, so having those new writers on board you never know where it\\'s going to go. For the old school fans there\\'s a lot of flavorful elements in it so they will definitely enjoy it.\"\\n\\nOn August 16, Jason Popson confirmed his return to the band via Facebook. Mushroomhead toured Australia for the first time as part of the Soundwave Festival 2014. On February 14, 2014, Mushroomhead released the date and name of their new album which will be released May 13, 2014 and the name of the new album is \"The Righteous & the Butterfly\". This album marks the return of J Mann. On April 15, 2014, Frontman Jeffrey Nothing released the band\\'s first unofficial single \"Qwerty\" on YouTube from his personal Facebook account. This marks the first song featuring J Mann since rejoining the band. The album received mostly positive reviews and is Mushroomhead\\'s first album to reach the top 20 of the Billboard Top 200 chart in the United States, reaching #20, selling around 11,000 copies the first week. The album also, reached #1 in the \"Billboard\" Indie chart, their first album to do so. \"The Righteous & the Butterfly\" reached #5 in the Top Rock Albums and #1 in the Top Hard Rock Albums. Mushroomhead have released an official music video for the album\\'s second single \"Out Of My Mind\". The band will be co-headlining the 2014 Shockfest Tour with Insane Clown Posse.\\n\\nAs of October 5, 2015, vocalist Waylon Reavis announced via his Facebook page that he had parted ways with Mushroomhead, citing \"irreconcilable differences with band ownership\" and stating he had \"severed all ties with Mushroomhead and Filthy Hands Company.\"\\n\\nMushroomhead went on a headlining UK tour in 2016, the first since 2002. American Head Charge was supposed to be their main support, but they ultimately decided to drop off the tour. A full European tour followed the next year.\\n\\nOn March 7, 2018, it was announced that vocalist and founding member Jeffrey \"Nothing\" Hatrix had parted ways with the band. Two days later, guitarist Tommy Church announced that he had also quit the band. On March 17, vocalist Steve Rauckhorst and guitarist Tommy \"Tankx\" Shaffner were revealed as the new members of the band.\\n\\nOn April 4, 2019, Mushroomhead announced that they had signed with Napalm Records.\\n\\nSection::::Musical style and influences.\\nMushroomhead\\'s sound combines elements of heavy metal, hip hop, experimental music, industrial music and techno. The band has been categorized as industrial metal, alternative metal, nu metal, experimental metal and electro-industrial.\\n\\nThey are influenced by bands such as Mr. Bungle, Faith No More, Pink Floyd, Pantera, Nine Inch Nails, and KMFDM. In a 2014 interview with music journalist Greg Prato, Jason Popson reflected on the band\\'s musical influences, stating \"When you\\'re talking about a band with nine guys, you\\'re talking about tons of influences. I know when we started the band, we were really into a lot of the stuff Mike Patton was doing - Faith No More or Mr. Bungle, things like that. But we also liked heavier bands like Meshuggah, Pantera. Then there\\'s electronic stuff. So it\\'s really all over the map. It\\'s everything from hard rock to punk rock to hip-hop to electronica. It\\'s pretty vast.\"\\n\\nSection::::Image and relationship with Slipknot.\\nThe members of Mushroomhead have identified themselves by wearing masks and by its distinct “X Face” logo – commonly worn on the masks of most members, as well as clothing and merchandise. The band originally adopted masks and stage names to not conflict with their original bands. The band\\'s look has evolved over the years, featuring alterations to bring them up to date and freshen up the image for new albums and tours.\\nIn January 2013, Mushroomhead Video Director, Maskmaker and Make-up artist Dave Henson Greathouse competed in Season 4 of original SyFy series \"Face Off\", a special effects prosthetic makeup reality show competition.\\nSince 1999, Mushroomhead has had an on-and-off rivalry with Iowa-based metal band Slipknot. The feud erupted (mostly among fans) due to the image similarities between the bands; such as the masks and costumes worn on stage. Before signing Slipknot, Roadrunner Records was interested in signing Mushroomhead, but Mushroomhead passed on the deal. As of 2009, the rivalry is now officially over as confirmed in several interviews with Waylon, ST1TCH and Skinny. Following the death of Slipknot member Paul Gray in 2010, Mushroomhead posted on their official Myspace page: \"R.I.P. Paul Gray, This feud needs to end. Much Love and Respect to the guys in Slipknot\".\\n\\nIn 2012, Slipknot singer Corey Taylor has stated that he never had a problem with the band, he only had a problem with the behavior of their fans due to a situation Slipknot faced when they played in Mushroomhead\\'s home town in Cleveland, OH and said there was never a real feud between bands but the feud was between Mushroomhead fans and Slipknot fans. He stated that doing a tour with Mushroomhead, Gwar, and Mudvayne “would be beautiful!”. The same year, Mushroomhead members joined Slipknot\\'s Sid Wilson on stage in an impromptu performance during Wilson\\'s DJ set.\\n\\nIn 2014, singer Jeffrey \"Nothing\" Hatrix stated about the feud between the two bands: \"Fans are very loyal to the bands they like. Members of both sides have said they are over it and that it was never really between the bands. Let’s all move on\".\\n\\nSection::::Band members.\\nCurrent members\\n\\nTouring members\\nFormer members\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Mushroomhead', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105480'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11054827', 'text': 'Licario\\n\\nLicario, called Ikarios () by the Greek chroniclers, was a Byzantine admiral of Italian origin in the 13th century. At odds with the Latin barons (the \"triarchs\") of his native Euboea, he entered the service of the Byzantine emperor Michael VIII Palaiologos (r. 1259–1282), and reconquered many of the Aegean islands for him in the 1270s. For his exploits, he was rewarded with Euboea as a fief and rose to the rank of \"megas konostaulos\" and \"megas doux\", the first foreigner to do so.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nSection::::Origins and early life.\\nLicario was born in Karystos in Latin-held Euboea (Negroponte), from a Vicentian father and a local woman. He was of humble origin, but able and ambitious. Serving as a knight under the Latin triarch Giberto II da Verona, he managed to win the heart of Felisa, sister of Giberto and widow of another triarch, Narzotto dalle Carceri. The match was met with disapproval by Felisa\\'s family. They secretly married, but the marriage was cancelled by her relatives. Fleeing from their wrath, Licario sought refuge in the fort of Anemopylae near Cavo D\\'Oro. He repaired the strong fortress, assembled a small group of followers, and began raiding the surrounding estates, belonging to the island\\'s nobles.\\n\\nSection::::Entry into Byzantine service.\\nAt that time, the newly restored Byzantine Empire, under the leadership of Michael VIII Palaiologos, sought to recover Euboea, which was the major Latin insular possession in the Aegean Sea, and the main naval base, not only of the Venetian fleet, but also of Latin piratical activity directed against his lands. Furthermore, along with the Principality of Achaea it presented the major obstacle to his complete recovery of Greece. Already in 1269/70, in retaliation for raids against the coasts of Asia Minor, a Byzantine fleet under Alexios Doukas Philanthropenos had attacked and captured many Latin nobles near the town of Oreos.\\n\\nFacing the persistent refusal of the island\\'s barons to treat with him, desiring vengeance and eager for glory and wealth, Licario presented himself to Philanthropenos, offering his services. He, in turn, took him to the Emperor, who was eager to use the services of talented Westerners whenever he could, and had already bankrolled several Latin corsairs in his service. Licario became the Emperor\\'s vassal according to Western feudal rules, and in turn was strengthened with imperial troops. Under the leadership of Licario, the Byzantines could now mount a serious attempt to conquer the island, while their forces were further augmented by many defections from the Greek population.\\n\\nIn 1272/73, the Byzantine forces, now under Licario\\'s command, launched a campaign that took the fortresses of Larmena, La Cuppa, Clisura and Manducho. The Lombard triarchs then appealed to their liege-lord, Prince William II of Achaea, and to Dreux de Beaumont, marshal of the Angevin Kingdom of Sicily. William was able to recover La Cuppa, but de Beaumont was defeated in a pitched battle and was subsequently recalled by Charles of Anjou. Between then and 1275, according to the Venetian chronicler Marino Sanudo, Licario himself served in the Byzantine army in Asia Minor, where he scored a victory against the Turks.\\n\\nSection::::Conquest of Euboea and campaigns in the Aegean.\\nIn 1276, following their great victory over the Lombard triarchs of Negroponte at the Battle of Demetrias, the Byzantines renewed their offensive in Euboea. Licario attacked his native Karystos, seat of the southern triarchy, and took it, after a long siege, in the same year. For this success, he was rewarded by Michael VIII with the whole island as a fief, and a noble Greek wife with a rich dowry. In turn, Licario pledged to provide 200 knights to the Emperor. Gradually, Licario reduced the Latin strongholds on the island, until, by 1278, he had seized almost all of it except for the capital, the city of Negroponte (Chalkis).\\n\\nFor his successes, Licario was rewarded with the post of \"megas konostaulos\", head of the Latin mercenaries, and eventually appointed as \"megas doux\" after Philanthropenos\\'s death in ; the first foreigner to be thus honoured. He commanded the Byzantine navy in a series of expeditions against the Latin-held Aegean islands. The first to fall was Skopelos, whose fortress was believed to be impregnable. Licario, however, knew that it lacked water supplies. Thus, he attacked it during the hot and dry summer of 1277 and forced its surrender. Its lord, Filippo Ghisi, was captured and sent to Constantinople; his other possessions, the islands of Skyros, Skiathos and Amorgos, were also taken soon after. After that, Licario went on to capture the islands of Kythera and Antikythera off the southern coast of the Morea, and later Kea, Astypalaia, and Santorini in the Cyclades. The great island of Lemnos was also captured, although its lord, Paolo Navigajoso, withstood a three-year siege before surrendering.\\n\\nFinally, in late 1279 or early 1280, he returned to Euboea, landing in the norther town of Oreos and moving south towards Negroponte. His forces by now included many Spanish and Catalan mercenaries (the first time the latter are mentioned in Greece) and even former adherents of Manfred of Sicily, who had fled to Greece after Manfred\\'s defeat and death at the hands of Charles of Anjou. As he reached Negroponte, the triarch Giberto II da Verona, Felisa\\'s brother, and John I de la Roche, the Duke of Athens, who were present at the city, rode out with their forces to meet him. The two armies met at the village of Vatondas, northeast of Negroponte. The battle resulted in a major victory for Licario: John de la Roche was unhorsed and captured, while Giberto was either killed (according to Sanudo) or captured and taken along with de la Roche as a prisoner to Constantinople, where, according to Nikephoros Gregoras, the sight of the hated renegade, moving triumphantly among the assembled Byzantine court, caused him to drop dead.\\n\\nAfter Vatondas, Negroponte seemed about to fall into Licario\\'s hands too. The city, however, was quickly reinforced by Jacques de la Roche, lord of Argos and Nauplia, who, along with the energetic Venetian \"bailo\" of Negroponte, Niccolo Morosini Rosso, led its defence. Facing determined resistance and possibly fearing an intervention of John I Doukas, ruler of Thessaly, Licario was forced to raise the siege. Licario then turned to reducing the remaining Latin strongholds on the island, becoming its total master except for the city of Negroponte itself, and ruling it from the fortress of Fillia. His fleet carried out further naval expeditions: the islands of Sifnos and Serifos were taken, and Licario\\'s ships raided the Morea.\\n\\nLicario himself sailed to Constantinople, presenting Emperor Michael VIII with his captives. Then, at the height of his fame and success in , Licario disappears from the sources, and his subsequent fate is unknown. Most likely he lived in Constantinople and died there.\\n\\nSection::::Assessment.\\nHis conquests proved temporary only, as the Byzantines were gradually evicted by the Venetians and the other Latin lords. Even in Euboea, Licario\\'s major gain and personal fief, the triarchs managed to complete their reconquest of the entire island by 1296. Nevertheless, Licario proved one of the most successful military leaders in Michael VIII\\'s employ, and his victories greatly enhanced the emperor\\'s own standing and prestige amongst the Latins. The historian Deno John Geanakoplos ranks him, along with Michael\\'s brother John Palaiologos, as the two men who caused the most damage to the Latin rulers of Greece.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Licario', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11054827'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '110563', 'text': 'Puhi, Hawaii\\n\\nPuhi (literally, \"blow\" in Hawaiian) is a census-designated place (CDP) in Kauai County, Hawaii, United States.

Although it was not the only such mission, it is the most well-known and possibly most significant in terms of its impact on the modernization of Japan after a long period of isolation from the West. The mission was first proposed by the influential Dutch missionary and engineer Guido Verbeck, based to some degree on the model of the Grand Embassy of Peter I.\\n\\nThe aim of the mission was threefold; to gain recognition for the newly reinstated imperial dynasty under the Emperor Meiji; to begin preliminary renegotiation of the unequal treaties with the dominant world powers; and to make a comprehensive study of modern industrial, political, military and educational systems and structures in the United States and Europe.\\n\\nThe Iwakura mission followed several such missions previously sent by the Shogunate, such as the Japanese Embassy to the United States in 1860, the First Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1862, and the Second Japanese Embassy to Europe in 1863.\\n\\nSection::::Participants.\\nThe mission was named after and headed by Iwakura Tomomi in the role of extraordinary and plenipotentiary ambassador, assisted by four vice-ambassadors, three of whom (Ōkubo Toshimichi, Kido Takayoshi, and Itō Hirobumi) were also ministers in the Japanese government. The historian Kume Kunitake as private secretary to Iwakura Tomomi, was the official diarist of the journey. The log of the expedition published in 1878 in five volumes as \"Tokumei Zenken Taishi Bei-O Kairan Jikki\" (特命全権大使米欧回覧実記), provided a detailed account of Japanese observations on the United States and rapidly industrializing Western Europe.\\n\\nAlso included in the mission were a number of administrators and scholars, totaling 48 people.

Several of the students were left behind to complete their education in the foreign countries, including five young women who stayed in the United States to study, including the then 6-year old Tsuda Umeko, who after returning to Japan, founded the Joshi Eigaku Juku (present day Tsuda University) in 1900, Nagai Shigeko, later Baroness Uryū Shigeko, as well as Yamakawa Sutematsu, later Princess Ōyama Sutematsu.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Itinerary.\\nSection::::United States.\\nOn 23 December 1871 the mission sailed from Yokohama on the , bound for San Francisco. Arriving in San Francisco on 15 January 1872, the group travelled by train via Salt Lake City and Chicago eventually reaching Washington, D.C. on 29 February. The mission\\'s stay in the United States was extended with an attempt to negotiate new treaty rights, a task that necessitated two members of the party to return to Japan to obtain necessary letters of representation. Members of the Iwakura Mission were keenly interested in observing schools and learning more about educational policy. Tours to schools, universities and industrial locations in Boston, New York and Washington DC were made as a result.\\n\\nUnsuccessful in their attempts to renegotiate the existing unequal treaties the party eventually set sail for the United Kingdom in August 1872.\\n\\nSection::::United Kingdom.\\nOn 17 August 1872 the Iwakura Mission arrived at Liverpool on the Cunard steamer Olympus. Traveling to London via Manchester the party spent much of late August and early September in and around the capital inspecting political, academic and military institutions, visiting the British Museum, travelling on the newly constructed London Underground and attending musical concerts at the Royal Albert Hall. After visits to the Royal dockyards at Portsmouth and a day visit to Brighton, the mission split into smaller groups to visit, among other places, Blair Atholl in the Highlands of Scotland, Edinburgh, the Yorkshire Dales and the industrial centers of Manchester, Glasgow, Edinburgh, Newcastle upon Tyne and Bradford.\\n\\nIwakura Tomomi led the Manchester-Liverpool delegation. A visit that culminated on 7 October in a civic reception and banquet where toasts highlighted the leading role of the region in world manufacturing, technology and municipal administration. In Glasgow, as guests of Lord Blantyre, the delegation stayed at Erskine House and given tours of shipbuilding and steel fabrication facilities on banks of the River Clyde.\\n\\nIn Newcastle upon Tyne the group arrived on 21 October staying in the Royal Station Hotel where they met the industrialist Sir William Armstrong. It had been ten years since the Bakufu mission had visited the town, but as a direct result of the visit significant new export orders were obtained for ships and armaments from Tyneside factories.\\n\\nThey visited the Elswick Engine and Ordnance Works with Captain Andrew Noble and George Rendell, inspected the hydraulic engines and the boring and turning departments and examined the construction of Armstrong and Gatling guns. They also visited the Gosforth Colliery, descending into the mine itself. Further visits were made to Bolkcow and Vaughan Iron Works in Middlesbrough and iron-ore mines in Cleveland. The Newcastle and Gateshead Chamber of Commerce arranged a river trip on the Tyne, taking in the High Level Bridge, the Tharsis Sulphur and Copper Company Hebburn and the Jarrow Chemical Works.\\n\\nFrom Newcastle upon Tyne the group travelled to Yorkshire, visiting the open countryside and Bolton Abbey prior to inspecting textile manufacturing facilities at Salts Mill in Saltaire and Dean Clough Mill in Halifax. Accompanied by the British Envoy to Japan, Sir Harry Smith Parkes, the group toured not only manufacturing facilities but also village accommodation, schools, almshouses, hospitals and parks provided by Sir Titus Salt and Sir John Crossley for their workers.\\n\\nA visit to Chatsworth House on 30 October was followed by visits to Burton-upon-Trent, Birmingham, Worcester, Stoke on Trent and Chester.\\n\\nThe delegation was presented at an official audience with Queen Victoria at Windsor Castle on 5 December 1872. Another audience with the Prince of Wales took place at Sandringham on 9 December. The party finally left for France on 16 December.\\n\\nSection::::France, Germany and the return to Japan.\\nFrance, Belgium, the Netherlands, Russia, Germany, Prussia, Denmark, Sweden, Bavaria, Austria, Italy, and Switzerland were all visited by the mission during the first half of 1873. On the return journey, Egypt, Aden, Ceylon, Singapore, Saigon, Hong Kong, and Shanghai were also stopping points en route, although visits in these locations were much shorter. The mission eventually reached Yokohama on 13 September 1873, almost two years after first setting out.\\n\\nSection::::Purpose and results.\\nOf the initial goals of the mission the aim of revision of the unequal treaties was not achieved, prolonging the mission by almost four months, but also impressing the importance of the second goal on its members. The attempts to negotiate new treaties under better conditions with the foreign governments led to criticism of the mission that members were attempting to go beyond the mandate set by the Japanese government. Members of the mission were nonetheless favorably impressed by industrial modernization seen in America and Europe and the experience of the tour provided them a strong impetus to lead similar modernization initiatives on their return.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Iwakura Mission', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1105944'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11059950', 'text': 'List of CDMA terminology\\n\\nThis page contains terminology related to CDMA International Roaming.

Until 1918, it was also associated with the princely titles of members of some German ruling and mediatised dynasties and with a few princely but non-ruling families. It was also the form of address used for cadet members of the dynasties of France, Italy, Russia and Ernestine Saxony, under their monarchies. Additionally, the treatment was granted for some, but not all, princely yet non-reigning families of Bohemia, Hungary, Italy, Poland, Romania and Russia by emperors or popes. In a handful of rare cases, it was employed by non-royal rulers in viceregal or even republican contexts.\\n\\nIn a number of older English dictionaries, \"serene\" as used in this context means \"supreme\"; \"royal\"; \"august\"; \"marked by majestic dignity or grandeur\"; or \"high or supremely dignified\".\\n\\nSection::::German-speaking lands.\\nThe current, legal usage of the style in the German-speaking countries is confined to the Princely Family of Liechtenstein, the entirety of which bears the treatment.\\n\\nThe German term is \"Durchlaucht\", a translation of the Latin \"(su)perillustris\". This is usually translated into English as \"Serene Highness\", however, it would be more literal to translate it as \"superior to, above, beyond or greater than illustrious\", as it is an augmentation of \"Erlaucht\" (\"illustrious\"), which was accorded to immediate counts (\"Reichsgrafen\") of the Holy Roman Empire and by mediatised counts of the German Confederation and the German Empire. The 1911 edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica wryly observes that a perfectly logical English version might be \"Your Serenity\".\\n\\nIn 1375 Emperor Charles IV bestowed the nobiliary style \"Durchlauchtig\" (Most Serene Highness) upon the seven Prince-electors designated by the Golden Bull of 1356. As from 1664 Emperor Leopold I vested all Imperial Princes with the title, it became so common that the Electors like the Archdukes of Austria began to use the superlative address \"Durchlauchtigst\". In the German Empire, the style of \"Serene Highness\" was usually held by princes of lower rank than those who were entitled to \"Highness\" (exceptions were the Wettin cadets of the Ernestine duchies), \"Grand Ducal Highness\", \"Royal Highness\", and \"Imperial Highness\". Therefore, if a woman entitled to the treatment of \"Royal Highness\" married a man who was addressed only as \"Serene Highness\", the woman usually retained her pre-marital style.\\n\\nIn 1905 Emperor Franz Joseph I of Austria granted the style of \"Durchlaucht\" to members of virtually every family which had held the title of prince in the former Holy Roman Empire, even if the family had never exercised sovereignty.\\n\\nIn the German and Austrian empires of the 19th and 20th centuries, the style \"Serene Highness\" was also officially borne by:\\n\\nBy tradition, \"Durchlaucht\" is still attributed to the princely dynasties which were sovereign until 1917 or had been mediatised under the Austro-Hungarian Empire and German Confederation in 1815, although the usage has been unofficial since 1918.\\n\\nN.B. The highest form of \"durchlauchtig\" (adjective) was allerdurchlauchtigst (absolutely most serene), which was reserved only to the Emperor in his style of adress: \"Allerdurchlauchtigster Großmächtigster Allergnädigster Kaiser und Herr\"\\n\\nSection::::Francophone dominions.\\nThere is some evidence that in pre-Revolutionary France, unlike Germany, one entitled to be addressed as \"Serene Highness\" was considered to outrank someone who was merely addressed as \"Highness\". Those members of the royal family who were not children or grandchildren of a king, i.e., the \"princes du sang\", were entitled to be addressed as \"Most Serene Highness\" (\"son altesse sérénissime\"). The simple style of \"Highness\" (\"altesse\") was claimed by the \"princes étrangers\" and the \"princes légitimés\". In fact, these formal styles were seldom employed in conversation, since the \"princes du sang\" used unique styles (e.g. \"Mademoiselle\", \"Monsieur le Prince\"), while the ducal peers, led by the proud Duc de Saint-Simon, avoided conceding the \"altesse\" to the \"princes étrangers\" and \"bâtards royals\", prompting nobles of lesser rank to do likewise.\\n\\nThe reigning Prince of Monaco, Albert II, is addressed as \"His Serene Highness\". His wife, children and younger sister, Princess Stéphanie, are also referred to as \"Serene Highness\". His elder sister, Princess Caroline, was also styled \"Her Serene Highness\" prior to her 1999 marriage, but is styled \"Royal Highness\" since then, even during the period when she was officially \"The Hereditary Princess of Monaco\" as heiress presumptive to the throne. In French, both male and female versions are \"Son Altesse Sérénissime\" (\"S.A.S.\"), which translates, literally, as \"His/Her \"Most\" Serene Highness\".\\n\\nSection::::Italy.\\nIn the Republic of Venice, also called \"the Serene Republic\", the Doge was known as \"Serenissimus\" (\"Most Serene\") as was the Duke of Mantua.\\n\\nChildren of the Savoy kings and crown princes of Italy were entitled to the treatment of \"Royal Highness\", but more remote male-line descendants were \"Serene Highnesses\" by right (although often the style of \"Royal Highness\" was granted to them \"ad personam\", e.g., the Dukes of Aosta or the Dukes of Genoa).\\n\\nThe mediatised House of Thurn and Taxis, entitled to the \"Serene Highness\" treatment in the German Empire, has a non-dynastic cadet branch, the Dukes di Castel Duino, which obtained naturalization in Italy in 1923. When incorporated into the Italian nobility, their use of the \"Serene Highness\" style was authorised by the Crown.\\n\\nSection::::San Marino.\\nSan Marino is styled as the Most Serene Republic.\\n\\nSection::::Poland.\\nIn the First Republic of Poland (1569-1795), also called \"the Most Serene Republic of Poland\" (\"Najjaśniejsza Rzeczpospolita Polska\"), His/Her \"Serene Reigning Majesty\" (SRM) was a style used by the reigning monarchs.\\n\\nSection::::Russia.\\nAfter 1886, great-grandchildren of Russian emperors in the male-line, and their descendants, were princes or princesses, and accorded the treatment of \"Serene Highness\". The exception was the senior male by primogeniture in the patrilineal descent of each great-grandson, who retained the higher style of \"Highness\". \\n\\nStrictly, the Russian term, \"Svetlost\", was an honorific used in adjectival form (\"Светлейший\": \"Svetleyshiy\") to refer to members of a select few of Russia\\'s princely families (e.g. \"The Serene\" Prince Anatoly Pavlovich Lieven or \"The Serene\" Prince Dmitri Vladimirovich Golitsyn). However, when translated into non-Slavic languages and used in reference to a member of the imperial Romanov family, it was usually rendered as \"Serene Highness\".\\n\\nSection::::United Kingdom.\\nQueen Victoria elevated each of the princes who married her daughters to \"Royal Highness\" (except for Crown Prince Friedrich of Prussia, husband of Victoria, Princess Royal, who already possessed the HRH). This included, on 30 January 1884, HSH Prince Henry of Battenberg, husband of Princess Beatrice. That couple\\'s children were granted the style of \"Highness\" by their British grandmother by letters patent 4 December 1886.\\n\\nSeveral morganatic branches of reigning German dynasties took up residence in the United Kingdom in the 19th century, where their German princely titles and style of \"Serene Highness\" were recognized by the sovereign. Included in this group were Princess Edward of Saxe-Weimar, Princess Victor of Hohenlohe-Langenburg, the dukes and princes of Teck and the princes of Battenberg.\\n\\nDuring World War I, King George V revoked recognition of the style \"Serene Highness\", hitherto used by some relatives of the British Royal Family who used German princely titles but lived in Britain. George V\\'s queen consort was born \"\"Her Serene Highness\" Princess Mary of Teck\", and Prince Philip\\'s mother had been born \"\"Her Serene Highness\" Princess Alice of Battenberg\". The Tecks (descended from the royal house of Württemberg) and the Battenbergs (descended from the Grand Dukes of Hesse and by Rhine) were compensated with multiple peerages, \"viz.\" Marquess of Cambridge and Earl of Athlone for the former, and Marquess of Milford Haven and Marquess of Carisbrooke for the latter.\\n\\nSection::::Belgium.\\nThe following titleholders or families are authorised by the Crown to use the style \"Serene Highness\": \\n\\n\\nSection::::Hungary.\\nBefore 1947, the style \"His/Her Serene Highness\" (Őfőméltósága, literally: \"His/Her High Dignity\") was in use in Hungary. Peers with the title of prince were entitled to it, and between 1920 and 1944 the regent, Miklós Horthy, was styled as His Serene Highness the Regent of the Kingdom of Hungary \"(Őfőméltósága, a Magyar Királyság kormányzója)\".\\n\\nSection::::Portugal.\\nAs the most powerful noble family in Portugal, the Dukes of Braganza had the official treatment of \"Serene Highness\" until 1640, when they mounted the Portuguese throne, thereby becoming entitled to the style of \"Royal Highness\", however the infantes not in direct line for the throne of Portugal were titled as \"His/Her Highness, the Serene Infante(a)\".\\n\\nSection::::Mexico.\\nFrom 1853 to 1855 the president of Mexico, Antonio Lopez de Santa Anna, enjoyed the official style of \"Most Serene Highness\", a treatment unique in that country.\\n\\nAgustin I de Mexico gave that title to several members of his family.\\n\\nSection::::Spain.\\nIn 1807 Manuel de Godoy, Prince de la Paz, was accorded the style of \"Most Serene Highness\", a treatment unique in that country at the time. Previous to this grant the style was sometimes used by the Catholic Monarch Isabella and Ferdinand as well as by other houses known anciently as illustrious or serene. A majority of these ancient houses lost the style through prescription. \\n\\nThe honorific () is one of the styles of the \"infantes\". \\nSection::::Thailand.\\nIn Thailand, the title of Serene Highness is the westernized style of the Thai title of Mom Chao (\"His/Her Serene Highness Prince/Princess\" | Thai: หม่อมเจ้า), denoting the grandchild of a king through one of his princely sons. In present-day Thailand, there are very few Mom Chao left after the royal family discontinued the traditional practice of polygamous marriages, and in Thailand all royal titles and styles decrease one level every generation for those not of the immediate royal family. Therefore, the child of a Mom Chao would only have the aristocratic title of Mom Rajawongse, which would then decrease in the next generation to Mom Luang, which would then decrease further, similar to a British life peerage.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Serene Highness', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106074'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1106101', 'text': 'Radiation hormesis\\n\\nRadiation hormesis is the hypothesis that low doses of ionizing radiation (within the region of and just above natural background levels) are beneficial, stimulating the activation of repair mechanisms that protect against disease, that are not activated in absence of ionizing radiation (similar to vaccinations). The reserve repair mechanisms are hypothesized to be sufficiently effective when stimulated as to not only cancel the detrimental effects of ionizing radiation but also inhibit disease not related to radiation exposure (see hormesis). This hypothesis has captured the attention of scientists and public alike in recent years.\\n\\nWhile the effects of high and acute doses of ionising radiation are easily observed and understood in humans (\"e.g.\" Japanese atomic bomb survivors), the effects of low-level radiation are very difficult to observe and highly controversial. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high and the risk of developing cancer fluctuates 40% because of individual life style and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low-level radiation. An acute effective dose of 100 millisieverts may increase cancer risk by ~0.8%. However, children are particularly sensitive to radioactivity, with childhood leukemias and other cancers increasing even within natural and man-made background radiation levels (under 4\\xa0mSv cumulative with 1\\xa0mSv being an average annual dose from terrestrial and cosmic radiation excluding radon which primarily doses the lung). There is also indication that exposures around this dose level will cause negative subclinical health impacts to neural development. Students born in regions of Sweden with higher Chernobyl fallout performed worse in secondary school, particularly in mathematics. “Damage is accentuated within families (i.e., siblings comparison) and among children born to parents with low education...\" who often don\\'t have the resources to overcome this additional health challenge.\\n\\nHormesis remains largely unknown to the public. Government and regulatory bodies disagree on the existence of radiation hormesis and research points to the \"severe problems and limitations\" with the use of hormesis in general as the \"principal dose-response default assumption in a risk assessment process charged with\\nensuring public health protection.\"\\n\\nQuoting results from a literature database research, the Académie des Sciences – Académie nationale de Médecine (French Academy of Sciences – National Academy of Medicine) stated in their 2005 report concerning the effects of low-level radiation that many laboratory studies have observed radiation hormesis. However, they cautioned that it is not yet known if radiation hormesis occurs outside the laboratory, or in humans.\\n\\nReports by the United States National Research Council and the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements and the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) argue that there is no evidence for hormesis in humans and in the case of the National Research Council hormesis is outright rejected as a possibility. Therefore, estimating Linear no-threshold model (LNT) continues to be the model generally used by regulatory agencies for human radiation exposure.\\n\\nSection::::Proposed mechanism and ongoing debate.\\nRadiation hormesis proposes that radiation exposure comparable to and just above the natural background level of radiation is not harmful but beneficial, while accepting that much higher levels of radiation are hazardous. Proponents of radiation hormesis typically claim that radio-protective responses in cells and the immune system not only counter the harmful effects of radiation but additionally act to inhibit spontaneous cancer not related to radiation exposure. Radiation hormesis stands in stark contrast to the more generally accepted linear no-threshold model (LNT), which states that the radiation dose-risk relationship is linear across all doses, so that small doses are still damaging, albeit less so than higher ones. Opinion pieces on chemical and radiobiological hormesis appeared in the journals Nature and Science in 2003.\\n\\nAssessing the risk of radiation at low doses (<100 mSv) and low dose rates (<0.1 mSv.min) is highly problematic and controversial. While epidemiological studies on populations of people exposed to an acute dose of high level radiation such as Japanese atomic bomb survivors () have robustly upheld the LNT (mean dose ~210 mSv), studies involving low doses and low dose rates have failed to detect any increased cancer rate. This is because the baseline cancer rate is already very high (~42 of 100 people will be diagnosed in their lifetime) and it fluctuates ~40% because of lifestyle and environmental effects, obscuring the subtle effects of low level radiation. Epidemiological studies may be capable of detecting elevated cancer rates as low as 1.2 to 1.3 \"i.e.\" 20% to 30% increase. But for low doses (1–100 mSv) the predicted elevated risks are only 1.001 to 1.04 and excess cancer cases, if present, cannot be detected due to confounding factors, errors and biases. \\n\\nIn particular, variations in smoking prevalence or even accuracy in reporting smoking cause wide variation in excess cancer and measurement error bias. Thus, even a large study of many thousands of subjects with imperfect smoking prevalence information will fail to detect the effects of low level radiation than a smaller study that properly compensates for smoking prevalence. Given the absence of direct epidemiological evidence, there is considerable debate as to whether the dose-response relationship <100 mSv is supralinear, linear (LNT), has a threshold, is \"sub-linear\", or whether the coefficient is negative with a sign change, i.e. a hormetic response.\\n\\nThe radiation adaptive response seems to be a main origin of the potential hormetic effect. The theoretical studies indicate that the adaptive response is responsible for the shape of dose-response curve and can transform the linear relationship (LNT) into the hormetic one. \\n\\nWhile most major consensus reports and government bodies currently adhere to LNT, the 2005 French Academy of Sciences-National Academy of Medicine\\'s report concerning the effects of low-level radiation rejected LNT as a scientific model of carcinogenic risk at low doses.\\n\\nUsing LNT to estimate the carcinogenic effect at doses of less than 20 mSv is not justified in the light of current radiobiologic knowledge.\\n\\nThey consider there to be several dose-effect relationships rather than only one, and that these relationships have many variables such as target tissue, radiation dose, dose rate and individual sensitivity factors. They request that further study is required on low doses (less than 100 mSv) and very low doses (less than 10 mSv) as well as the impact of tissue type and age. The Academy considers the LNT model is only useful for regulatory purposes as it simplifies the administrative task. Quoting results from literature research, they furthermore claim that approximately 40% of laboratory studies on cell cultures and animals indicate some degree of chemical or radiobiological hormesis, and state:\\n\\n...its existence in the laboratory is beyond question and its mechanism of action appears well understood.\\n\\nThey go on to outline a growing body of research that illustrates that the human body is not a passive accumulator of radiation damage but it actively repairs the damage caused via a number of different processes, including:\\n\\n\\nFurthermore, increased sensitivity to radiation induced cancer in the inherited condition Ataxia-telangiectasia like disorder, illustrates the damaging effects of loss of the repair gene Mre11h resulting in the inability to fix DNA double-strand breaks.\\n\\nThe BEIR-VII report argued that, \"the presence of a true dose threshold demands totally error-free DNA damage response and repair.\" The specific damage they worry about is double strand breaks (DSBs) and they continue, \"error-prone nonhomologous end joining (NHEJ) repair in postirradiation cellular response, argues strongly against a DNA repair-mediated low-dose threshold for cancer initiation\". Recent research observed that DSBs caused by CAT scans are repaired within 24-hours and DSBs maybe more efficiently repaired at low doses, suggesting the risk ionizing radiation at low doses may not by directly proportional to the dose. However, it is not known if low dose ionizing radiation stimulates the repair of DSBs not caused by ionizing radiation \"i.e.\" a hormetic response. \\nRadon gas in homes is the largest source of radiation dose for most individuals and it is generally advised that the concentration be kept below 150 Bq/m³ (4 pCi/L). A recent retrospective case-control study of lung cancer risk showed substantial cancer rate reduction between 50 and 123 Bq per cubic meter relative to a group at zero to 25 Bq per cubic meter. This study is cited as evidence for hormesis, but a single study all by itself cannot be regarded as definitive. Other studies into the effects of domestic radon exposure have not reported a hormetic effect; including for example the respected \"Iowa Radon Lung Cancer Study\" of Field et al. (2000), which also used sophisticated radon exposure dosimetry. In addition, Darby et al. (2005) argue that radon exposure is negatively correlated with the tendency to smoke and environmental studies need to accurately control for this; people living in urban areas where smoking rates are higher usually have lower levels of radon exposure due the increased prevalence of multi-story dwellings. When doing so, they found a significant increase in lung cancer amongst smokers exposed to radon at doses as low as 100 to 199 Bq m and warned that smoking greatly increases the risk posed by radon exposure \"i.e.\" reducing the prevalence of smoking would decrease deaths caused by radon. However, the discussion about the opposite experimental results is still going on, especially the popular US and German studies have found some hormetic effects.\\n\\nFurthermore, particle microbeam studies show that passage of even a single alpha particle (e.g. from radon and its progeny) through cell nuclei is highly mutagenic, and that alpha radiation may have a higher mutagenic effect at low doses (even if a small fraction of cells are hit by alpha particles) than predicted by linear no-threshold model, a phenomenon attributed to bystander effect. However, there is currently insufficient evidence at hand to suggest that the bystander effect promotes carcinogenesis in humans at low doses.\\n\\nSection::::Statements by leading nuclear bodies.\\nRadiation hormesis has not been accepted by either the United States National Research Council, or the National Council on Radiation Protection and Measurements (NCRP). In May 2018, the NCRP published the report of an interdisciplinary group of radiation experts who critically reviewed 29 high-quality epidemiologic studies of populations exposed to radiation in the low dose and low dose-rate range, mostly published within the last 10 years. The group of experts concluded:\\n\\nIn addition, the United Nations Scientific Committee on the Effects of Atomic Radiation (UNSCEAR) wrote in its most recent report:\\nof tumour induction proportionate to the radiation dose is consistent with developing knowledge and that it remains, accordingly, the most scientifically defensible approximation of low-dose response. However, a strictly linear dose response should not be expected in all circumstances.\\n\\nThis is a reference to the fact that very low doses of radiation have only marginal impacts on individual health outcomes. It is therefore difficult to detect the \\'signal\\' of decreased or increased morbidity and mortality due to low-level radiation exposure in the \\'noise\\' of other effects. The notion of radiation hormesis has been rejected by the National Research Council\\'s (part of the National Academy of Sciences) 16-year-long study on the Biological Effects of Ionizing Radiation. \"The scientific research base shows that there is no threshold of exposure below which low levels of ionizing radiation can be demonstrated to be harmless or beneficial. The health risks – particularly the development of solid cancers in organs – rise proportionally with exposure\" says Richard R. Monson, associate dean for professional education and professor of epidemiology, Harvard School of Public Health, Boston.\\n\\nSection::::Studies of low level radiation.\\nSection::::Very high natural background gamma radiation cancer rates at Kerala, India.\\nKerala\\'s monazite sand (containing a third of the world\\'s economically recoverable reserves of radioactive thorium) emits about 8 micro Sieverts per hour of gamma radiation, 80 times the dose rate equivalent in London, but a decade long study of 69,985 residents published in Health Physics in 2009: \"showed no excess cancer risk from exposure to terrestrial gamma radiation. The excess relative risk of cancer excluding leukemia was estimated to be -0.13 Gy_1 (95% CI: -0.58, 0.46)\", indicating no statistically significant positive or negative relationship between background radiation levels and cancer risk in this sample.\\n\\nSection::::Cultures.\\nStudies in cell cultures can be useful for finding mechanisms for biological processes, but they also can be criticized for not effectively capturing the whole of the living organism.\\n\\nA study by E.I. Azzam suggested that pre-exposure to radiation causes cells to turn on protection mechanisms. A different study by de Toledo and collaborators, has shown that irradiation with gamma rays increases the concentration of glutathione, an antioxidant found in cells.\\n\\nIn 2011, an \"in vitro\" study led by S.V. Costes showed in time-lapse images a strongly non-linear response of certain cellular repair mechanisms called radiation-induced foci (RIF). The study found that low doses of radiation prompted higher rates of RIF formation than high doses, and that after low-dose exposure RIF continued to form after the radiation had ended. Measured rates of RIF formation were 15 RIF/Gy at 2 Gy, and 64 RIF/Gy at .1 Gy. These results suggest that low dose levels of ionizing radiation may not increase cancer risk directly proportional to dose and thus contradict the linear-no-threshold standard model. Mina Bissell, a world-renowned breast cancer researcher and collaborator in this study stated “Our data show that at lower doses of ionizing radiation, DNA repair mechanisms work much better than at higher doses. This non-linear DNA damage response casts doubt on the general assumption that any amount of ionizing radiation is harmful and additive.”\\n\\nSection::::Animals.\\nAn early study on mice exposed to low dose of radiation daily (0.11 R per day) suggest that they may outlive control animals. A study by Otsuka and collaborators found hormesis in animals. Miyachi conducted a study on mice and found that a 200 mGy X-ray dose protects mice against both further X-ray exposure and ozone gas. In another rodent study, Sakai and collaborators found that (1 mGy/hr) gamma irradiation prevents the development of cancer (induced by chemical means, injection of methylcholanthrene).\\n\\nIn a 2006 paper, a dose of 1 Gy was delivered to the cells (at constant rate from a radioactive source) over a series of lengths of time. These were between 8.77 and 87.7 hours, the abstract states for a dose delivered over 35 hours or more (low dose rate) no transformation of the cells occurred. Also for the 1 Gy dose delivered over 8.77 to 18.3 hours that the biological effect (neoplastic transformation) was about \"1.5 times less than that measured at high dose rate in previous studies with a similar quality of [X-ray] radiation.\" Likewise it has been reported that fractionation of gamma irradiation reduces the likelihood of a neoplastic transformation. Pre-exposure to fast neutrons and gamma rays from Cs-137 is reported to increase the ability of a second dose to induce a neoplastic transformation.\\n\\nCaution must be used in interpreting these results, as it noted in the BEIR VII report, these pre-doses can also increase cancer risk:\\n\\nHowever, 75\\xa0mGy/d cannot be accurately described as a low dose rate – it is equivalent to over 27 sieverts per year. The same study on dogs showed no increase in cancer nor reduction in life expectancy for dogs irradiated at 3\\xa0mGy/d.\\n\\nSection::::Humans.\\nSection::::Effects of sunlight exposure.\\nIn an Australian study which analyzed the association between solar UV exposure and DNA damage, the results indicated that although the frequency of cells with chromosome breakage increased with increasing sun exposure, the misrepair of DNA strand breaks decreased as sun exposure was heightened.\\n\\nSection::::Effects of cobalt-60 exposure.\\nThe health of the inhabitants of radioactive apartment buildings in Taiwan has received prominent attention in popular treatments of radiation hormesis. In 1982, more than 20,000 tons of steel was accidentally contaminated with cobalt-60, and much of this radioactive steel was used to build apartments and exposed thousands of Taiwanese to gamma radiation levels of up to >1000 times background (average 47.7\\xa0mSv, maximum 2360\\xa0mSv excess cumulative dose) – it was not until 1992 that the radioactive contamination was discovered. A medical study published in 2004 claimed the cancer mortality rates in the exposed population were much lower than expected. However, this initial study failed to control for age, comparing a much younger exposed population (mean age 17.2 years at initial exposure) with the much older general population of Taiwan (mean age approx. 34 years in 2004), a serious flaw. Older people have much higher cancer rates even in the absence of excess radiation exposure.\\n\\nA subsequent study by Hwang \"et al.\" (2006) found the incidence of \"all cancers\" in the irradiated population was 40% lower than expected (95 vs. 160.3 cases expected), except for leukaemia in men (6 vs. 1.8 cases expected) and thyroid cancer in women (6 vs. 2.8 cases expected), an increase only detected amongst those exposed before the age of 30. Hwang \"et al.\" proposed that the lower rate of \"all cancers\" might be due to the exposed populations higher socioeconomic status and thus overall healthier lifestyle, but this was difficult to prove. Additionally, they cautioned that leukaemia was the first cancer type found to be elevated amongst the survivors of the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombings, so it may be decades before any increase in more common cancer types is seen.\\n\\nBesides the excess risks of leukaemia and thyroid cancer, a later publication notes various DNA anomalies and other health effects among the exposed population:\\nThere have been several reports concerning the radiation effects on the exposed population, including cytogenetic analysis that showed increased micronucleus frequencies in peripheral lymphocytes in the exposed population, increases in acentromeric and single or multiple centromeric cytogenetic damages, and higher frequencies of chromosomal translocations, rings and dicentrics. Other analyses have shown persistent depression of peripheral leucocytes and neutrophils, increased eosinophils, altered distributions of lymphocyte subpopulations, increased frequencies of lens opacities, delays in physical development among exposed children, increased risk of thyroid abnormalities, and late consequences in hematopoietic adaptation in children.\\n\\nSection::::Effects of no radiation.\\nGiven the uncertain effects of low-level and very-low-level radiation, there is a pressing need for quality research in this area. An expert panel convened at the 2006 Ultra-Low-Level Radiation Effects Summit at Carlsbad, New Mexico, proposed the construction of an Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory. The laboratory, if built, will investigate the effects of almost \"no radiation\" on laboratory animals and cell cultures, and it will compare these groups to control groups exposed to natural radiation levels. Precautions would be made, for example, to remove potassium-40 from the food of laboratory animals. The expert panel believes that the Ultra-Low-Level Radiation laboratory is the only experiment that can explore with authority and confidence the effects of low-level radiation; that it can confirm or discard the various radiobiological effects proposed at low radiation levels e.g. LNT, threshold and radiation hormesis.\\n\\nThe first preliminary results of the effects of almost no-radiation on cell cultures was reported by two research groups in 2011 and 2012; researchers in the US studied cell cultures protected from radiation in a steel chamber 650 meters underground at the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad, New Mexico and researchers in Europe reported the effects of almost no-radiation on mouse cells (pKZ1 transgenic chromosomal inversion assay).\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Radiation hormesis', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1106101'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'LxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11063687', 'text': 'Zoltán Blum\\n\\nZoltán Blum (also known as Zoltán Virág; 3 January 1892 – 25 December 1959) was a Hungarian amateur football (soccer) player who competed in the 1912 Summer Olympics.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nBlum was born in Pápa.

Her whereabouts remain unknown.\\n\\nMadeleine was on holiday from the UK with her parents, Kate and Gerry McCann; her two-year-old twin siblings; and a group of family friends and their children. She and the twins had been left asleep at 20:30 in the ground-floor apartment, while the McCanns and friends dined in a restaurant 55 metres (180\\xa0ft) away. The parents checked on the children throughout the evening, until Madeleine\\'s mother discovered she was missing at 22:00. Over the following weeks, particularly after misinterpreting a British DNA analysis, the Portuguese police came to believe that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment and that her parents had covered it up. The McCanns were given \"arguido\" (suspect) status in September 2007, which was lifted when Portugal\\'s attorney general archived the case in July 2008 because of a lack of evidence.\\n\\nThe parents continued the investigation using private detectives until Scotland Yard opened its own inquiry, Operation Grange, in 2011.

They were placed in 5A Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva, one of several privately owned properties rented to holidaymakers.\\n\\n5A was a two-bedroom, ground-floor apartment in the fifth block of a group of apartments known as Waterside Village, which lay on the perimeter of part of Mark Warner\\'s Ocean Club resort. Matthew and Rachel Oldfield were next door in 5B, Jane Tanner and Russell O\\'Brien in 5D, and the Paynes and Dianne Webster on the first floor. The apartment block was not gated and 5A was at the corner of two roads, making it accessible to the public from two sides. Sliding glass patio doors in the living room at the back overlooked the Ocean Club\\'s pool, tennis courts, tapas restaurant and bar. The patio doors could be accessed via a public street, Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins, where a small gate and set of steps led to 5A\\'s balcony and living room. 5A\\'s front door was on the opposite side of the block from the Ocean Club, on Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva.\\n\\nThe McCanns\\' children slept in a bedroom next to the front door, which the McCanns kept locked. The bedroom had one waist-high window with curtains and a metal exterior shutter, the latter controlled by a cord inside the window; the McCanns kept the curtains and shutter closed throughout the holiday. The window overlooked a narrow walkway and residents\\' car park, which was separated from the street by a low wall. Madeleine slept in a single bed next to the bedroom door, on the opposite side of the room from the window, while the twins were in travel cots in the middle of the room. There was an empty single bed beneath the window.\\n\\nSection::::Thursday, 3 May 2007.\\nSection::::20:30: Tapas restaurant.\\nThursday, 3 May, was the penultimate day of the family\\'s holiday. Over breakfast Madeleine asked: \"Why didn\\'t you come when [her brother] and I cried last night?\" After the disappearance, her parents wondered whether this meant someone had entered the children\\'s bedroom. Her mother also noticed a large brown stain on Madeleine\\'s pyjama top.\\n\\nThe children spent the morning in the resort\\'s Kids\\' Club, then the family lunched at their apartment before heading to the pool. The children returned to Kids\\' Club, then at 18:00 their mother took them back to 5A, while their father went for a tennis lesson. The McCanns put the children to bed at around 19:00. Madeleine was left asleep in short-sleeved, pink-and-white Marks and Spencer\\'s Eeyore pyjamas, next to her comfort blanket and a soft toy, Cuddle Cat.\\n\\nAt 20:30 the parents left 5A to dine with their friends in the Ocean Club\\'s open-air tapas restaurant, located on the other side of the pool. 5A lay about 55 metres (160\\xa0ft) from the restaurant as the crow flies, but getting to the restaurant involved walking along a public street to reach the doors of the Ocean Club resort, then walking through the resort to the other side of the pool, a distance of about 82 metres (295\\xa0ft). The top of the apartment was visible from the restaurant, but not the doors. The patio doors could be locked only from the inside, so the McCanns left them closed but unlocked, with the curtains drawn, so they could let themselves in that way when checking on the children. There was a child-safety gate at the top of the steps from the patio and a low gate at the bottom, which led to the street.\\n\\nThe resort\\'s staff had left a note in a message book at the swimming-pool reception area, asking that the same table, which overlooked the apartments, be block-booked for 20:30 for the McCanns and friends every evening for the last four evenings of the holiday. The message said the group\\'s children were asleep in the apartments. Madeleine\\'s mother believes the abductor may have seen the note. The McCanns and their friends left the restaurant roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine\\'s father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled having left the children\\'s bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open. He pulled it nearly closed again before returning to the restaurant.\\n\\nSection::::21:15: Tanner sighting.\\nThe sighting by Jane Tanner, one of the Tapas Seven, of a man carrying a child that night became an important part of the early investigation. She had left the restaurant just after 21:00 to check on her own daughter, passing Madeleine\\'s father on Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins on his way back to the restaurant from his 21:05 check. He had stopped to chat to a British holidaymaker, but neither man recalled having seen Tanner. This puzzled the Portuguese police, given how narrow the street was, and led them to accuse Tanner of having invented the sighting.\\n\\nTanner told the police that at around 21:15 she had noticed a man carrying a young child walk across the junction of Rua Dr Francisco Gentil Martins and Rua Dr Agostinho da Silva just ahead of her. He was not far from Madeleine\\'s bedroom, heading east, away from the front of apartment 5A. In the early days of the investigation, the direction in which he was walking was thought to be important, because he was moving toward the home of Robert Murat, the 33-year-old British-Portuguese man who lived near apartment 5A, and who became the case\\'s first suspect.\\n\\nThe child in the man\\'s arms was wearing light-coloured pink pyjamas with a floral pattern and cuffs on the legs, similar to Madeleine\\'s. Tanner described the man as white, dark-haired, 5\\xa0ft 7 in (1.70 m) tall, of southern European or Mediterranean appearance, 35–40 years old, wearing gold or beige trousers and a dark jacket, and said he did not look like a tourist. Tanner told the Portuguese police, but they did not pass the description to the media until 25 May. Madeleine\\'s Fund hired a forensic artist to create an image of the man \"(left)\", which was released in October 2007.\\n\\nThe sighting became important because it offered investigators a time frame for the abduction, but Scotland Yard came to view it as a red herring. In October 2013 they said that a British holidaymaker had been identified as the man Tanner had seen; he had been returning to his apartment after collecting his daughter from the Ocean Club night creche. Scotland Yard took photographs of the man wearing the same or similar clothes to the ones he was wearing on the night, and standing in a pose similar to the one Tanner reported. The pyjamas his daughter had been wearing also matched Tanner\\'s report. Operation Grange\\'s lead detective, DCI Andy Redwood, said they were \"almost certain\" the Tanner sighting was not related to the abduction.\\n\\nSection::::22:00: Smith sighting.\\nThe dismissal of the Tanner sighting allowed investigators to focus on a report made to Portuguese police on 26 May 2007 by Martin and Mary Smith.\\nAt around 22:00, the Smiths saw a man on Rua da Escola Primária, from the McCanns\\' apartment, walking away from the Ocean Club and toward Rua 25 de Abril and the beach. He was carrying a girl aged 3–4 years. She had blonde hair and pale skin, was wearing light-coloured pyjamas, and had bare feet. The man was mid-30s, 5\\xa0ft 7\\xa0in–5\\xa0ft 9\\xa0in (1.75–1.80 m), slim-to-normal build, with short brown hair, wearing cream or beige trousers. He did not look like a tourist, according to the Smiths, and had seemed uncomfortable carrying the child. E-fits based on the Smiths testimony were first created in 2008 by Oakley International, private investigators hired by the McCanns, and were publicized in 2013 by Scotland Yard on \"Crimewatch\".\\n\\nScotland Yard concluded in 2013 that the Smith sighting offered the approximate time of Madeleine\\'s kidnap.\\n\\nSection::::22:00: Reported missing.\\nMadeleine\\'s mother had intended to check on the children at 21:30, but Matthew Oldfield, one of the Tapas Seven, offered to do it when he checked on his own children in the apartment next door to 5A. He noticed that the McCanns\\' children\\'s bedroom door was wide open, but after hearing no noise, he left 5A without looking far enough into the bedroom to see whether Madeleine was there. He could not recall whether the bedroom window and its exterior shutter were open at this point. Early on in the investigation, the Portuguese police accused Oldfield of involvement because he had volunteered to do the check, suggesting to him that he had handed Madeleine to someone through the bedroom window.\\n\\nKate made her own check of 5A at around 22:00. Scotland Yard said in 2013 that Madeleine was probably taken moments before this. Kate recalled entering the apartment through the unlocked patio doors at the back, and noticing that the children\\'s bedroom door was wide open. When she tried to close the door, it slammed shut as though there was a draught, which is when she saw that the bedroom window and its shutter were open. Madeleine\\'s Cuddle Cat and pink blanket were still on the bed, but Madeleine was gone. After briefly searching the apartment, Kate ran back towards the restaurant, screaming \"Madeleine\\'s gone! Someone\\'s taken her!\"\\n\\nAt around 22:10 Madeleine\\'s father sent Matthew Oldfield to ask the resort\\'s reception desk to call the police, and at 22:30 the resort activated its missing-child search protocol. Sixty staff and guests searched until 04:30, at first assuming that Madeleine had wandered off. One of them told Channel 4\\'s \"Dispatches\" that, from one end of Luz to the other, you could hear people calling her name.\\n\\nSection::::Early response.\\nSection::::Portuguese police.\\nTwo officers from the gendarmerie, the Guarda Nacional Republicana (GNR), arrived at the resort at 23:10 from Lagos, five miles (8\\xa0km) away. At midnight, after briefly searching, they alerted the criminal police, the Polícia Judiciária (PJ), in nearby Portimão. Kate McCann said the PJ arrived just after 01:00. According to the PJ, they arrived within 10 minutes of being alerted. At 02:00 two patrol dogs were brought to the resort and at 08:00 four search-and-rescue dogs. Police officers had their leave cancelled and started searching waterways, wells, caves, sewers and ruins. Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, head of the PJ in Portimão, became the inquiry\\'s coordinator.\\n\\nIt was widely acknowledged that mistakes were made during the so-called \"golden hours\" soon after the disappearance. Neither border nor marine police were given descriptions of Madeleine for many hours, and officers did not make house-to-house searches. According to Kate, roadblocks were first put in place at 10:00 the next morning. Police did not request motorway surveillance pictures of vehicles leaving Praia da Luz the night of the disappearance, or of the road between Lagos and Vila Real de Santo António on the Spanish border. Euroscut, the company that monitors the road, said they were not approached for information. It took Interpol five days to issue a global missing-person alert.\\n\\nNot everyone in the resort at the time was interviewed; holidaymakers later contacted the British police to say no one had spoken to them. The crime scene was not secured. Police took samples from Madeleine\\'s bedroom, which were sent to three forensic labs in Portugal. It was reported on 1 June 2007 that DNA from one \"stranger\" had been found, but around 20 people had entered apartment 5A before it was closed off, according to Chief Inspector Olegário de Sousa of the PJ. According to Madeleine\\'s mother, an officer placed tape across the doorway of the children\\'s bedroom, but left at 03:00 without securing the apartment. The PJ case file, released in 2008, showed that 5A lay empty for a month after the disappearance, then was let out to tourists before being sealed off in August 2007 for more forensic tests. A similar situation arose outside the apartment. A crowd gathered by the front door of 5A, including next to the children\\'s bedroom window—through which an abductor may have entered or left—trampling on evidence. An officer dusted the bedroom window\\'s exterior shutter for fingerprints without wearing gloves or other protective clothing.\\n\\nSection::::British police.\\nIn the UK it was agreed that Madeleine\\'s home force, Leicestershire police—led by Chief Constable Matt Baggott—would coordinate the British response, although it remained a Portuguese inquiry. A strategic coordinating group, or \"gold\" group, was put together, representing Leicestershire police, the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA), the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP), and the National Police Improvement Agency. The PJ gave a team from the UK a room in which to work, but apparently resented their presence. The British police were used to feeding their data into HOLMES 2 (the Home Office Large Major Enquiry System). In Portugal, the information was collected in boxes. In addition the PJ had less autonomy than police in the UK, often having to wait for magistrates\\' decisions, which slowed things down. In an interview for Anthony Summers\\' and Robbyn Swan\\'s book \"Looking for Madeleine\" (2014), Jim Gamble, head of CEOP at the time, said the Portuguese police felt they were being condescended to, and that the British were acting as a \"colonial power\".\\n\\nAt her parents\\' request, Madeleine was made a ward of court in England shortly after her disappearance, giving the court statutory powers to act on her behalf.\\n\\nSection::::Media and PR.\\nA PJ officer acknowledged in 2010 that the Portuguese police had been suspicious of the McCanns from the start, because of the \"media circus\". Gerry McCann told \"Vanity Fair\" in 2008 that he had decided to \"market\" Madeleine to keep her in the public eye. To that end, a string of public relations people arrived in Praia da Luz, deeply resented by the local police, who saw the media attention as counterproductive. Alex Woolfall of the British PR firm Bell Pottinger, representing Mark Warner Ltd, dealt with the media for the first ten days, then the British government sent in press officers. This was apparently unprecedented.\\n\\nThe first government press officer was Sheree Dodd, a former \"Daily Mirror\" journalist, who was followed by Clarence Mitchell, director of media monitoring for the Central Office of Information. When the government withdrew Mitchell, the McCanns hired Justine McGuinness, who was reportedly headhunted for the job. When she left, Hanover Communications took over briefly, headed by Charles Lewington, formerly John Major\\'s private secretary. In September 2007 Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows stepped forward as a benefactor and offered to cover Clarence Mitchell\\'s salary so that he could return. Mitchell resigned from his government position and started working for the McCanns full-time; he was later paid by Madeleine\\'s Fund.\\n\\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine\\'s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007 to raise money and awareness; its website attracted 58 million hits in the first two days. Throughout May and June the couple\\'s PR team arranged events to give reporters a news peg. There was a visit to the Portuguese city of Fátima, where three children had reported a Marian apparition in 1917, as well as trips to Holland, Germany, Spain, and Morocco. On 30 May 2007, accompanied by reporters, the couple flew to Rome—in Sir Philip Green\\'s Learjet—to meet Pope Benedict XVI, a visit arranged by Cardinal Cormac Murphy-O\\'Connor, the Archbishop of Westminster. The following month balloons were let off in 300 cities around the world. From early June journalists began to voice concerns. The \"sheer professionalism of it\\xa0... troubled journalists\", according to Matthew Parris. Placing Madeleine on the front page of a British newspaper would sell up to 30,000 extra copies. She appeared on the cover of \"People\" magazine on 28 May 2007, on the front page of several British tabloids every day for almost six months, and became one of Sky News\\'s menu options: \"UK News\", \"Madeleine\", \"World News\". Between May 2007 and July 2008, the Portuguese tabloid \"Correio da Manhã\" published 384 articles about her. By June 2008 over seven million posts and 3,680 videos were returned in a search for her name on YouTube.\\n\\nSection::::First Portuguese inquiry (2007–2008).\\nSection::::First \"arguido\".\\nTwelve days after the disappearance, Robert Murat, a 34-year-old British-Portuguese property consultant, became the first \"arguido\". Born in Hammersmith, west London, Murat lived in his mother\\'s house, \"Casa Liliana\", 150 yards (137 m) from apartment 5A in the direction in which the man in the Tanner sighting had walked. He was made an \"arguido\" after a \"Sunday Mirror\" journalist told police he had been asking a lot of questions about the case. The PJ had briefly signed him up as an official interpreter; he said he had wanted to help because he had a daughter in England around Madeleine\\'s age.\\n\\nThree members of the Tapas Seven—Fiona Payne, Russell O\\'Brien and Rachael Oldfield—said they had seen Murat outside apartment 5A shortly after the disappearance, as did an Ocean Club nanny and two British holidaymakers, one a barrister and the other a businesswoman. This would not have been surprising considering how close Murat lived to 5A, but he and his mother said he had been at home all evening. The McCann circle was clearly suspicious of Murat: one of the McCanns\\' supporters offered Richard Bilton, a BBC reporter, \"exclusive access to any new developments in the case\" if Bilton would report back what the press pack was saying about Murat. Beginning on 15 May 2007, Murat\\'s home was searched, the pool drained, his cars, computers, phones and video tapes examined, his garden searched using ground radar and sniffer dogs, and two of his associates questioned. In March 2008, one of those associates had his car torched, with the word \"fala\" (\"speak\") sprayed in red on the pavement.\\n\\nThere was nothing to link Murat or his friends to the disappearance, and Murat\\'s \"arguido\" status was lifted on 21 July 2008 when the case was archived. In April 2008 he received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in what \"The Observer\" said was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue; his friends received £100,000 each. In July 2014, during Operation Grange, one of those friends was questioned again as a witness, this time by the PJ on behalf of Scotland Yard. In December that year Murat and his wife were questioned, also on behalf of Scotland Yard, along with eight others. In 2017 Murat\\'s mother, Jenny Murat, added her voice to those who had witnessed suspicious events around 5A that night: she told the BBC that she had driven past apartment 5A that night, and had seen a young woman in a plum-coloured top behaving suspiciously just outside it, information she said she passed to the police at the time. She also said she had seen a small brown rental car speeding toward the apartment, driving the wrong way down a one-way street.\\n\\nSection::::Witness statements.\\nIn statements to the PJ, witnesses described men behaving oddly near apartment 5A in the days leading up to the disappearance and on the day itself. Scotland Yard came to believe that these men may have been engaged in reconnaissance, either for an abduction or a burglary. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns\\' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which burglars had entered through windows.\\n\\nOn 20 April, four hundred yards from apartment 5A, a bedraggled-looking manpushy and intimidatingasked a tourist in her apartment for money for an orphanage. On 25 or 26 April, the tourist who rented apartment 5A before the McCanns encountered a man on his balcony who had entered via the steps from the street; polite and clean-shaven, the visitor asked for money for an orphanage. On the day of the disappearance, 3 May, there were four charity collections by two men in the streets around 5A. At 4 pm two black-haired men approached a British homeowner looking for funds for a hostel or hospice, and at 5 pm two men approached another British tourist with a similar story.\\n\\nAn \"ugly\" blonde-haired man was seen on 29 April on Rua do Ramelhete, and again on 2 May across the road from 5A, apparently watching it. On 30 April the granddaughter of 5A\\'s former owners saw a blonde-haired man leaning against a wall behind the apartments, and saw him again on 2 May near the tapas restaurant, looking at 5A. She described him as Caucasian, mid-30s, short cropped hair, \"ugly\" with spots. On the day of the disappearance or the day before, a man was seen staring at the McCanns\\' apartment block, where a white van was parked.\\n\\nIn the late afternoon of 3 May, a girl on the balcony of the apartment immediately above 5A saw a man leave through the gate belowas though from a ground-floor apartmentand look around before shutting the gate quietly, with both hands. At 14:30 two blonde-haired men were seen on the balcony of 5C, an empty apartment two doors from 5A. At 16:00–17:00 a blonde-haired man was seen near 5A. At 18:00 the same or another blonde-haired man was seen in the stairwell of the McCanns\\' block. At 23:00, after the disappearance, two blonde-haired men were seen in a nearby street speaking in raised voices. When they realized they had been noticed, they reportedly lowered their voices and walked away.\\n\\nSection::::McCanns as \"arguidos\".\\nSection::::Early suspicion.\\nThe first indication that the media was turning against the McCanns was on 6 June 2007, when a German journalist asked them during a Berlin press conference whether they were involved in the disappearance. On 30 June a 3,000-word article entitled \"The Madeleine Case: A Pact of Silence\" appeared in \"Sol\", a Portuguese weekly, stating that the McCanns were suspects, highlighting alleged inconsistencies between their statements, and implying that the Tanner sighting had been invented. The reporters had obtained the Tapas Sevens\\' mobile numbers and that of another witness, so it was apparent that the inquiry had a leak.\\n\\nThis and later articles in the Portuguese press, invariably followed up in the UK, made several allegations, based on no evidence, that would engulf the McCanns for years on social media. They included that the McCanns and Tapas Seven were \"swingers\", that the McCanns had been sedating their children, and that the group had formed a \"pact of silence\" regarding what had happened the night of the disappearance. Much was made of apparent inconsistencies within and between the McCanns\\' and Tapas Seven\\'s statements. The police had asked the group questions in Portuguese, and an interpreter had translated the replies. According to Kate McCann, the statements were then typed up in Portuguese, and verbally translated back into English for the interviewees to sign.\\n\\nAmong the inconsistencies was whether the McCanns had entered the apartment by the front or back door when checking on the children. According to the PJ case file, Gerry stated during his first interview, on 4 May 2007, that the couple had entered 5A through the locked front door for his 21:05 and her 22:00 checks, and in a second interview, on 10 May, that he had entered through the unlocked patio doors at the back. (The patio doors could be unlocked only from inside, so the parents had left them unlocked to let themselves in.) There was also an inconsistency about whether the front door had been locked. Gerry told the \"Sunday Times\" in December 2007 that they had used the front door earlier in the week, but it was next to the children\\'s bedroom, so they had started using the patio doors instead. The PJ also questioned why, when Kate discovered Madeleine was missing, she had run to the restaurant leaving the twins alone in 5A, when she could have used her cell phone or shouted to the group from 5A\\'s rear balcony.\\nAnother issue was whether the exterior shutter over Madeleine\\'s bedroom window could be opened from outside. According to journalist Danny Collins, the shutter was made of non-ferrous metal slats on a roller blind that was housed in a box at the top of the inside window, controlled by pulling on a strap. Once rolled down, the slats locked in place outside the window and could be raised only by using the strap on the inside. Kate said the shutter and window were closed when Madeleine was put to bed, but open when she discovered Madeleine was missing. Gerry told the PJ that, when he was first alerted to the disappearance, he had lowered the shutter, then had gone outside and discovered that it could be raised only from the outside. Against this, the police said the shutter could not be raised from the outside without being forced, but there was no sign of forced entry; they also said forcing the shutter open would have caused a lot of noise.\\n\\nThe apparent discrepancies contributed to the view of the PJ that there had been no abduction. Kate\\'s shout of \"they\\'ve taken her\" was viewed with suspicion, as though she had been paving the way for an abduction story. Particularly from August onwards, these suspicions developed into the theory that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident—perhaps after being sedated to help her stay asleep—and that her parents had hidden her body for a month, before retrieving her and driving her to an unknown place in a car they had hired over three weeks after the disappearance. In 2010 Carlos Anjos, former head of the Police Detectives Union in Portugal, told BBC \"Panorama\" that most Portuguese investigators still believed Madeleine had died as a result of an accident in the apartment.\\n\\nSection::::Portugal sends a letter rogatory.\\nOn 28 June 2007 the McCanns suggested to the PJ that the police request help from Danie Krugel, a South African former police officer who had developed a \"matter orientation system\", a handheld device that he claimed could locate missing people using DNA and satellites. On hearing about this years later, one scientist said it had caused his \"BS detector to go off the scale\". Kate McCann wrote in 2011 that Krugel\\'s claims made no sense, but the couple were desperate. In the second week of June they sent him hair and eyelashes from Madeleine collected from the family home by relatives in the UK. Krugel arrived in Praia da Luz on 15 July, and told the McCanns his equipment had picked up a \"static signal\" in an area of the beach near the Rocha Negra cliff.\\n\\nThe officer in charge of the PJ inquiry, Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, interpreted Kate\\'s support of Krugel as a ploy. By this point he believed the McCanns were involved in the disappearance, and that Kate was using Krugel—she had also considered using psychics—to \"disclose the location of her daughter\\'s body\" without compromising herself.\\n\\nWith this in mind, the PJ sent a letter rogatory to the British police to ask for assistance in their search for Madeleine\\'s body. In response Mark Harrison, the national search adviser for the British National Policing Improvement Agency, arrived in Praia da Luz in July. He walked around the search areas, and flew over them by helicopter. His report, dated 23 July 2007, described Krugel\\'s ideas as \"highly unlikely\". It said that 100 officers had searched up to 9.3 miles around Praia da Luz, but that the officer in charge and most of the team had no training in search procedures, with the exception of a search-and-rescue team from Lisbon. Search dogs had been used, but after five days instead of within two days as the handlers recommend. Harrison suggested searching the beach and shoreline, an open area near the village, Robert Murat\\'s property, apartment 5A, the Tapas Seven\\'s apartments, and any hired vehicles. He recommended using ground-penetrating radar and bringing in Keela and Eddie, two Springer spaniel sniffer dogs from South Yorkshire.\\n\\nSection::::British sniffer dogs arrive.\\nKeela was a crime-scene-investigation (CSI) dog trained to give her handler, Martin Grime, a \"passive alert\" to the scent of human blood by placing her nose close to the spot, then freezing in that position. Eddie was a cadaver dog or enhanced-victim-recovery dog (EVRD) who gave a \"bark alert\" to the scent of human cadavers, including shortly after the death of the subject, even if the remains were buried, incinerated or in water. He was trained to bark only in response to that scent and not for any other reason.\\n\\nThe dogs arrived in Praia da Luz on 31 July 2007, and were taken to apartment 5A, nearby wasteland, and the beach. Both dogs alerted behind the sofa in the living room of 5A, and Eddie gave an alert near the wardrobe in the main bedroom. There were no alerts on the beach or wasteland. The PJ obtained search warrants to search the house the McCanns had rented on Rua das Flores, and the silver Renault Scénic the couple had hired 24 days after Madeleine went missing. The house and grounds were searched on 2 August. The only alert was from Eddie when he encountered Cuddle Cat, which was lying in the living room; Keela did not give an alert. The police left with boxes of the McCanns\\' clothes, Cuddle Cat, a pair of latex gloves, suitcases, a notepad, two diaries, including one that Kate had started after the disappearance, and a friend\\'s Bible she had borrowed. A passage the Bible\\'s owner had marked from 2 Samuel, about the death of a child, was copied into the police case file along with a Portuguese translation. The items were taken to another location, where Eddie alerted to one of the boxes of clothes. A source close to the McCanns\\' lawyers told reporters that, if there was indeed a smell of corpses on Kate\\'s clothes, it could have been caused by her contact with corpses as a family doctor.\\n\\nThe police removed the silver Renault Scenic the McCanns had hired three weeks after the disappearance, and on 6 August Keela and Eddie were taken to an underground car park opposite the PJ headquarters in Portimão, where 10 cars were parked, 20–30 feet apart, including the McCanns\\' and Robert Murat\\'s. Eddie, the cadaver dog, gave an alert outside the McCanns\\' car by the driver\\'s door. \\nThe next morning Keela alerted to the rear driver\\'s side inside the boot (trunk) and the map compartment in the driver\\'s door, which contained the ignition key and key ring. When the key ring was hidden underneath sand in a fire bucket, she alerted again, as she did when the bucket was moved to a different floor of the car park. Almost immediately the Portuguese press began running stories that Madeleine had died inside apartment 5A.\\n\\nSection::::British DNA analysis.\\nHair and other fibres were collected from areas in the car and apartment 5A where Keela and Eddie had given alerts, and were sent to the Forensic Science Service (FSS) in Birmingham for DNA profiling, arriving around 8 August 2007. At this point, according to the \"Sunday Times\", the PJ \"abandoned the abduction theory\". On 8 August, without waiting for the results from Birmingham, the Portuguese police called the McCanns to a meeting in Portimão, where Guilhermino Encarnação, PJ regional director, and Luis Neves, coordinator of the Direcção Central de Combate ao Banditismo in Lisbon, told them the case was now a murder inquiry. When Encarnação died of stomach cancer in 2010, \"The Daily Telegraph\" identified him as a major source of the leaks against the McCanns. Both the McCanns were interrogated that day; the officers suggested that Kate\\'s memory was faulty.\\n\\nThe FSS used a technique known as low copy number (LCN) testing. Used when only a few cells are available, the test is controversial because it is vulnerable to contamination and misinterpretation. On 3 September John Lowe of the FSS emailed Detective Superintendent Stuart Prior of the Leicestershire police, the liaison officer between the British and Portuguese police. Lowe told Prior that a sample from the car boot contained 15 out of 19 of Madeleine\\'s DNA components, and that the result was \"too complex for meaningful interpretation\":\\n\\nA complex LCN [low copy number] DNA result which appeared to have originated from at least three people was obtained from cellular material recovered from the luggage compartment section\\xa0... Within the DNA profile of Madeleine McCann there are 20 DNA components represented by 19 peaks on a chart.\\xa0... Of these 19 components 15 are present within the result from this item; there are 37 components in total. There are 37 components because there are at least 3 contributors; but there could be up to five contributors. In my opinion therefore this result is too complex for meaningful interpretation/inclusion.\\xa0... [W]e cannot answer the question: Is the match genuine, or is it a chance match.\\n\\nSection::::McCanns made \"arguidos\".\\nThe Forensic Science Service email was translated into Portuguese on 4 September. The next day, according to Kate, the PJ proposed that, if she were to admit that Madeleine had died in an accident in the apartment, and that she had hidden the body, she might only serve a two-year sentence. Her husband would not be charged and would be free to leave. Both parents were given \"arguido\" status on 7 September, and were advised by their lawyer not to answer questions. The PJ told Gerry that Madeleine\\'s DNA had been found in the car boot and behind the sofa in 5A. Gerry did respond to questions, but Kate declined to reply to 48 questions she was asked during an 11-hour interview.\\n\\nThe DNA evidence was a \"100 percent match\", journalists in Portugal were told. British tabloid headlines included \"Brit Lab Bombshell: Car DNA is 100% Maddie\\'s\" (\"The Sun\", 11 September 2007) and \"Corpse in McCann Car\" (\"London Evening Standard\", 16 October 2007), while the \"Daily Star\" reported that a \"clump of Maddie\\'s hair\" had been found in the car. Jerry Lawton, a \"Daily Star\" reporter, told the Leveson Inquiry in March 2012 that the leaks had come directly from the Portuguese police. Matt Baggott—who when Madeleine disappeared was chief constable of Leicestershire Police, the force that coordinated the British side of the case—told the inquiry that, because the Portuguese were in charge of the case, he had made a decision not to correct reporters. His force\\'s priority, he said, was to maintain a good relationship with the PJ with a view to finding Madeleine.\\n\\nSection::::McCanns return to the UK, Almeida report.\\nDespite their \"arguido\" status, the McCanns were allowed to leave Portugal, and on legal advice did so immediately, arriving back in England on 9 September 2007. The following day Chief Inspector Tavares de Almeida of the PJ in Portimão signed a nine-page report concluding that Madeleine had died in apartment 5A as a result of an accident, that the restaurant meal and apparent regular checks on the McCann children had been part of the cover-up, that the Tapas Seven had helped to mislead the police, and that the McCanns had concealed the body, then faked an abduction. An 11-page document from the Information Analysis Brigade in Lisbon analysed alleged discrepancies in the McCanns\\' statements. On 11 September the public prosecutor, José Cunha de Magalhães e Meneses, handed the 10-volume case file to a judge, Pedro Miguel dos Anjos Frias. Meneses applied for the seizure of Kate\\'s diary and Gerry\\'s laptop. The police also wanted to trace telephone calls the McCanns and Tapas Seven had made, and there were details in the report about the number of suitcases the McCanns and their friends had taken back to England.\\n\\nOn 28 September 2007, according to a diplomatic cable published by WikiLeaks in 2010, the American ambassador to Portugal, Al Hoffman, wrote about a meeting he had had with the British ambassador to Portugal, Alexander Ellis, on 21 September 2007. The cable said: \"Without delving into the details of the case, Ellis admitted that the British police had developed the current evidence against the McCann parents, and he stressed that authorities from both countries were working co-operatively. He commented that the media frenzy was to be expected and was acceptable as long as government officials keep their comments behind closed doors.\"\\n\\nIn the UK Control Risks, a British security company—paid by an anonymous donor to assist the McCanns since 7 May 2007—took hair samples from the McCann twins on 24 September 2007, at their parents\\' request. The twins had slept through the commotion in apartment 5A after Madeleine was reported missing; Kate wrote that she was concerned the abductor might have given the children sedatives. According to the PJ files, Kate had asked them to take samples, three months after the disappearance, but they had not done so. Control Risks took a sample from Kate too, to rebut allegations that she was on medication. No trace of drugs was found. \\n\\nSection::::Gonçalo Amaral\\'s removal, later developments.\\nOn 2 October 2007 Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaral, the inquiry\\'s coordinator, was removed from his post and transferred from Portimão to Faro after telling the newspaper \"Diário de Notícias\" that the British police had only pursued leads helpful to the McCanns and had ignored that the couple were suspects. As an example, he criticized their decision to follow up an anonymous email to Prince Charles that claimed a former Ocean Club employee had taken Madeleine.\\n\\nAmaral was himself an \"arguido\" in relation to his investigation of another case, the disappearance of Joana Cipriano. Amaral was made \"arguido\" one day after Madeleine\\'s disappearance; the following month he was charged with making a false statement and four other officers were charged with assault. Eight-year-old Joana Cipriano had vanished in 2004 from Figueira, seven miles (11\\xa0km) from Praia da Luz. Her body was never found, and no murder weapon was identified. Her mother and the mother\\'s brother were convicted of her murder after confessing, but the mother retracted her confession, saying she had been beaten by police. Amaral was not present when the beating is alleged to have taken place, but he was accused of having covered up for others. The other detectives were acquitted. Amaral was convicted of perjury in May 2009 and received an 18-month suspended sentence.\\n\\nThe Madeleine inquiry was taken over by Paulo Rebelo, deputy national director of the PJ, which expanded its team of detectives and began a case review. On 29 November 2007 four members of the Portuguese inquiry, including Francisco Corte-Real, vice-president of Portugal\\'s forensic crime service, were briefed at Leicestershire police headquarters by the British Forensic Science Service. In April 2008 the Tapas Seven were interviewed by Leicestershire police in England, with the PJ in attendance. The PJ planned the following month to hold a reconstruction in Praia da Luz, using the McCanns and Tapas Seven rather than actors, but the Tapas Seven declined to participate. The poor relationship between the McCanns and Portuguese police was evident again that month when, on the day the couple were at the European Parliament to promote a monitoring system for missing children, transcripts of their interviews with the PJ were leaked to Spanish television. The national director of the PJ, Alípio Ribeiro, resigned not long after this, citing media pressure from the investigation; he had publicly said the police had been hasty in naming the McCanns as suspects. Portuguese prosecutors were examining several charges against the McCanns, including child abandonment, abduction, homicide and concealment of a corpse.\\n\\nSection::::Inquiry closed (21 July 2008).\\nOn 21 July 2008 the Portuguese Attorney General, Fernando José Pinto Monteiro, announced that there was no evidence to link the McCanns or Robert Murat to the disappearance. Their \"arguido\" status was lifted and the case was closed. Monteiro said in a statement:\\n\\nThe case involving Madeleine McCann will be shelved following the decision by the two magistrates in charge that no evidence was found to implicate the arguidos. Hereby the condition of all three arguidos ceases\\xa0... and the bail measures imposed upon the same have expired. If they appeal against the decision it can be reopened.\\xa0... The inquiry may be reopened by decision of prosecuting council or by request of any of those involved if new, serious and relevant evidence emerges.\\n\\nOn 4 August Portugal\\'s Ministério Público released 17 case files containing 11,233 pages on CD-ROM to the media, including 2,550 pages of sightings. The files included a 58-page prosecutors\\' report, which concluded: \"No element of proof whatsoever was found which allows us to form any lucid, sensible, serious and honest conclusion about the circumstances.\" In 2009 Portugal released a further 2,000 pages. Days after the case closed, excerpts from Kate McCann\\'s diary, which had been taken by the PJ in August 2007, were published in translation by a Portuguese tabloid, \"Correio da Manhã\", despite a Portuguese judge\\'s ruling in June 2008 that the seizure had been a privacy violation and that any copies must be destroyed. On 14 September 2008 a News International tabloid, \"News of the World\", published the extracts, again without permission and now translated poorly back into English.\\n\\nSection::::Amaral\\'s book (24 July 2008).\\nIn July 2008, Chief Inspector Gonçalo Amaralby then retiredpublished a book alleging that Madeleine had died in the McCann\\'s appartment. By November 2008 it had sold 180,000 copies and by 2010 had been translated into six languages. A documentary based on the book, broadcast in Portugal in 2009, was seen by 2.2 million people.\\n\\nIn 2015 the McCanns were awarded over €600,000 in libel damages against Amaral and his publisher, but this was overturned on appeal. A 2009 injunction halting sale of the book was overturned in 2010, reinstated in conjunction with the libel ruling, then lifted again when the libel judgment was overturned in 2016. The McCanns appealed to Portugal\\'s Supreme Court, which ruled that they had not, in fact, been cleared by the archiving of the criminal case in 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Madeleine\\'s Fund inquiry (2007–2011).\\nSection::::Raising money.\\nThe McCanns set up Madeleine\\'s Fund: Leaving No Stone Unturned Ltd on 15 May 2007, 12 days after the disappearance. Over 80 million people visited the fund\\'s website, \"Find Madeleine\", in the three months after the disappearance. From September 2007, Brian Kennedy of Everest Windows supported the couple financially, and Kennedy\\'s lawyer joined the fund\\'s board of directors.\\n\\nAppeals were made by public figures and screened at football matches across Britain. Between May 2007 and March 2008, the Fund received £1,846,178, including £1.4 million through the bank, £390,000 online, and £64,000 from merchandise. Donations included £250,000 from the \"News of the World\", £250,000 from Sir Philip Green, $50,000 from Simon Cowell, and $25,000 from Coleen Rooney. J. K. Rowling and Richard Branson made large donations; Branson donated £100,000 to a legal fund for the McCanns. The fund did not cover the couple\\'s legal costs arising from their status as \"arguidos\", but it was criticized in October 2007 for having made two of the McCanns\\' mortgage payments, before they were made \"arguidos\".\\n\\nA reward of £2.5 million was also offered, including from the \"News of the World\", Rowling, Branson, Green, and a Scottish businessman, Stephen Winyard. In March 2008 the Express Group paid the fund £550,000 and £375,000 in the form of libel damages arising out of articles about the McCanns and Tapas Seven respectively. In 2011 Kate McCann\\'s book, \"Madeleine\", was serialized by \"The Sun\" and \"The Sunday Times\", both owned by News International, for a payment to the fund of ₤500,000 to ₤1 million. In December 2015 the fund stood at around ₤750,000. it had seven directors, including the McCanns.\\n\\nSection::::Private investigators.\\nMadeleine\\'s Fund hired several firms of private investigators, causing friction with the Portuguese police. Shortly after the disappearance, an anonymous benefactor paid for the services of a British security company, Control Risks. There had reportedly been four independent sightings from North Africa; Brian Kennedy went to Morocco himself in September 2007 to look into one sighting. A Norwegian woman had reported seeing a girl matching Madeleine\\'s description in a petrol station near Marrakesh, Morocco, on 9 May 2007; the child had reportedly asked the man she was with, in English, \"Can we see Mummy soon?\" When the witness returned home to Spain, she learned about the disappearance and telephoned the Spanish police. A month later, according to Kate McCann, the police had still not formally interviewed the woman, which led the McCanns to fear that leads were not being pursued. The McCanns themselves travelled to Morocco on 10 June 2007 to raise awareness. They spent the night at the British ambassador\\'s residence and were briefed by consular staff and a Metropolitan police attaché.\\n\\nBrian Kennedy hired a Spanish agency, Método 3, for six months at £50,000 a month, which put 35 investigators on the case in Europe and Morocco. It seems the relationship came to an end in part because the head of the agency made several public statements that concerned the McCanns, including to CBS that \"We know the kidnapper. We know who he is and how he has done it.\" Another private investigator was David Edgar, a retired detective inspector hired in 2009 on the recommendation of the head of Manchester\\'s Serious Crime Squad. Edgar released an e-fit in August that year of a woman said to have asked two British men in Barcelona, Spain, shortly after the disappearance, whether they were there to deliver her new daughter. Other private initiatives included a Portuguese lawyer financing the search of a reservoir near Praia da Luz in February 2008, and the use of ground radar by a South African property developer, Stephen Birch, who said in 2012 that scans showed there were bones beneath the driveway of a house in Praia da Luz.\\n\\nSection::::Oakley International.\\nIn 2008 Madeleine\\'s Fund hired Oakley International, a Washington, D.C.-registered detective agency, for over £500,000 for six months. (The company owner, Kevin Halligen, was arrested in 2009 in connection with an unrelated fraud allegation. He died in 2018.) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer who had worked for MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among paedophile rings and the Roma community.\\n\\nExton questioned the significance of the Tanner sighting of a man carrying a child at 21:15 near apartment 5A, and focused instead on the Smith sighting at 22:00—the sighting by Martin and Mary Smith of a man carrying a child toward the beach. The Oakley team based on the Smiths\\' description. This was a sensitive issue, because on 9 September 2007 Martin Smith had watched BBC footage of the McCanns arrive in the UK from Portugal, at the height of public debate about their alleged involvement. As Gerry McCann exited the aircraft with his son in his arms, Smith believed he recognized him as the man he had seen carrying the child in Praia da Luz. He reported his suspicion to Leicestershire police but later came to accept that he was mistaken: at 22:00 witnesses placed Gerry in the tapas restaurant. Nevertheless, publication of the Smith e-fits, which bore some resemblance to Gerry, would have fed the conspiracy theories about the McCanns.\\n\\nExton submitted his report to Madeleine\\'s Fund in November 2008, and suggested releasing the e-fits, but the fund told Exton that the report and its e-fits had to remain confidential. The relationship between the company and the fund had soured, in part because of a dispute over fees, and in part because the report was critical of the McCanns and their friends; it suggested that Madeleine may have died in an accident after leaving the apartment herself through its unlocked patio doors. Madeleine\\'s Fund passed the e-fits to the police—the PJ and Leicestershire police had them by October 2009, and Scotland Yard received them when they became involved in August 2011—but did not otherwise release them. Kate McCann did not include them with the other images of suspects in her book, \"Madeleine\" (2011), although she suggested that both the Tanner and Smith sightings were crucial. Scotland Yard released the e-fits in October 2013 for a BBC \"Crimewatch\" reconstruction. After it had aired, \"The Sunday Times\" published that the McCanns had had the e-fits since 2008. In response the couple complained that the \"Sunday Times\" story implied (wrongly) that the McCanns had not only failed to publish the e-fits but had withheld them from the police. The newspaper published an apology on an inside page in December 2013. The McCanns subsequently sued and received £55,000 in damages, which Gerry McCann said would be donated to charity.\\n\\nSection::::Further police inquiries (2011–present).\\nSection::::Gamble report.\\nThe McCanns met the British Home Secretary Alan Johnson in 2009 to request a review of the case. Johnson commissioned a scoping report from Jim Gamble, then head of the Child Exploitation and Online Protection Centre (CEOP). By March 2010 the Home Office had begun discussions with the Association of Chief Police Officers about setting up a British inquiry.\\n\\nDelivered in May 2010, the Gamble report examined how several British agencies had become involved in the search for Madeleine, including CEOP itself, Leicestershire police, the Metropolitan Police Service, the Serious Organised Crime Agency, the National Police Improvement Agency, Crimestoppers, the Home Office, Foreign Office and 10 Downing Street.\\n\\nGamble criticized the lack of coordination. Everyone had wanted to help, and some had wanted \"to be seen to help\", he wrote, which had \"created a sense of chaos and a sense of competition\", hampering the inquiry by causing resentment among the Portuguese police. He recommended renewed cooperation between the British and Portuguese, that all relevant information be exchanged between the police forces, that police perform an analysis of telephone calls made on the night of the disappearance, and that all leads be pursued, including those developed by private detectives.\\n\\nSection::::Operation Grange.\\nIn May 2011, under Home Secretary Theresa May, Scotland Yard launched an investigative review, Operation Grange, with a team of 29 detectives and eight civilians. The announcement of the review appeared to have been triggered by a News International campaign, by way of one of its British tabloids, \"The Sun\". On 11 May 2011, as it was serializing Kate McCann\\'s book, \"Madeleine\", \"The Sun\"s front page hosted an open letter from the McCanns in which they asked Prime Minister David Cameron to set up a new inquiry; 20,000 people signed the newspaper\\'s petition that day. On the same day, according to her testimony to the Leveson Inquiry, Theresa May spoke by telephone, at her instigation, to Rebekah Brooks, chief executive of News International, and Dominic Mohan, editor of \"The Sun\". The next day she wrote to the commissioner of the Metropolitan Police, Sir Paul Stephenson, to say that the Portuguese police had agreed to cooperate with a British inquiry. Within 24 hours, Cameron made the announcement about Operation Grange, to be financed by a Home Office contingency fund.\\n\\nOperation Grange was led by Commander Simon Foy. Detective Chief Inspector (DCI) Andy Redwood of Scotland Yard\\'s Homicide and Serious Crime Command was the first senior investigating officer, reporting to Detective Chief Superintendent Hamish Campbell. The team consisted of three detective inspectors, five detective sergeants, 19 detective constables, and around six civilian staff. When Redwood retired in 2014, he was replaced by DCI Nicola Wall. By July 2013 the review had become an investigation.\\n\\nThe team had tens of thousands of documents translated, released an age-progressed image, and investigated over 8,000 potential sightings. By 2015 they had taken 1,338 statements, collected 1,027 exhibits, and investigated 650 sex offenders and 60 persons of interest. The inquiry was scaled back in October 2015 and the number of officers reduced to four. In April 2016 the Home Secretary approved additional funding of £95,000 for what the Metropolitan Police Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, said was one remaining line of inquiry; another £85,000 in 2017 to cover up to September that year; and £150,000 in November 2018 to cover until 31 March 2019, taking the cost of the inquiry to £11.75 million.\\n\\nSection::::Theories: Planned abduction, burglary, wandered off.\\nDCI Redwood made clear that Operation Grange was looking at a \"criminal act by a stranger\", most likely a planned abduction or a burglary that Madeleine had disturbed. There had been a fourfold increase in local burglaries between January and May 2007, including two in the McCanns\\' block in the 17 days before the disappearance, during which intruders had entered through windows. In an interview in April 2017, just before the 10th anniversary of the disappearance, Scotland Yard\\'s Assistant Commissioner, Mark Rowley, appeared to dismiss the \"burglary gone wrong\" hypothesis, while adding that it was \"not entirely ruled out\". Referring to the suspects who might have been involved in burglaries in the area, he said that police had \"pretty much closed off that group of people\". The remaining detectives were focusing on a small number of inquiries that they believed were significant. Also that month there were claims that Scotland Yard was looking for a woman seen near 5A at the time of the disappearance.\\n\\nRedwood said in 2013 that, \"on one reading of the evidence\", the disappearance did look like a pre-planned abduction, which \"undoubtedly would have involved reconnaissance\". Several witnesses described men hanging around near apartment 5A in the days before the disappearance and on the day itself. In May 2013 Scotland Yard wanted to trace 12 manual workers who were at the Ocean Club when Madeleine disappeared, including six British cleaners in a white van who were offering their services to British expats. In October 2013 Scotland Yard and the BBC\\'s \"Crimewatch\" staged a reconstruction—broadcast in the UK, the Netherlands and Germany—during which they released e-fits of the men seen near 5A and of the Smith sighting. Days after \"Crimewatch\" aired, Portugal\\'s attorney general reopened the Portuguese inquiry, citing new evidence.\\n\\nAnother theory is that Madeleine, nearly four at the time, left the apartment by herself, perhaps to look for her parents, and was abducted by a passer-by or fell into one of the open construction sites nearby. This is widely regarded as unlikely. According to her mother, Madeleine would have had to open the unlocked patio doors, close the curtains behind her, close the door again, open and close the child gate at the top of the stairs, then open and close the gate leading to the street.\\n\\nSection::::Tracking mobile phone calls.\\nUsing mobile-phone tracking techniques, police were able to trace who had used cell phones near the scene of the disappearance within the important time frame. Tracking the calls apparently required the cooperation of over 30 countries. The analysis turned up several telephone calls and texts between three men near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance: a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver, and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. Detectives interviewed them in June 2014; they denied any connection to the disappearance.\\n\\nPolice also found that the cell phone of a former Ocean Club restaurant worker had been used near the resort that night. Originally from Cape Verde, West Africa, Euclides Monteiro died in 2009 in a tractor accident after being fired from the Ocean Club in 2006 for theft. The suspicion was that he had been breaking into apartments to finance a drug habit. His widow said he had been questioned previously about break-ins involving the sexual assault of children, but had been cleared by DNA evidence.\\n\\nSection::::Holiday-home sexual assaults.\\nScotland Yard issued another appeal in March 2014 for information about a man who had entered holiday homes occupied by British families in four incidents in the western Algarve between 2004 and 2006, two of them in Praia da Luz. On those occasions he sexually assaulted five white girls, aged 7–10, in their beds. The man spoke English with a foreign accent and his speech was slow and perhaps slurred. He had short, dark, unkempt hair, tanned skin, and in the view of three victims a distinctive smell; he may have worn a long-sleeved burgundy top, perhaps with a white circle on the back. These were among 12 incidents in the area between 2004 and 2010. The PJ reportedly believed the intruder in the four incidents between 2004 and 2006 was Euclides Monteiro, the former Ocean Club employee from Cape Verde who died in 2009.\\n\\nSection::::Searches and interviews in Praia da Luz.\\nIn June 2014 officers from Scotland Yard and the PJ, accompanied by archaeologists and sniffer dogs, searched drains and dug in 60,000 square metres of wasteland in Praia da Luz. Nothing was found. The following month, at Scotland Yard\\'s request, the PJ in Faro interviewed four Portuguese citizens, with Scotland Yard in attendance. No evidence was found to implicate them. One man, an associate of Robert Murat, was first questioned shortly after the disappearance. Pedro do Carmo, deputy director of the PJ, told the BBC in 2017 that the interviews had been conducted only because Scotland Yard had requested them: \"We never saw or looked at those people as suspects of the crime.\" Eleven people, including three Britons, were interviewed in December 2014. According to the Portuguese media, Scotland Yard compiled 253 questions for the interviewees, including \"Did you kill Madeleine?\" and \"Where did you hide the body?\" Robert Murat, his wife, and her ex-husband were questioned, as were a 30-year-old former Ocean Club bus driver and his 24-year-old and 53-year-old associates. The bus driver and associates had telephoned or texted each other near the Ocean Club around the time of the disappearance. They admitted to having broken into Ocean Club apartments but denied having taken Madeleine.\\n\\nSection::::Other inquiries.\\nIn the early days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from paedophile investigations, and Madeleine\\'s parents were shown photographs of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who had been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.\\n\\nA man from Northern Ireland who died in 2013 was discussed in the media in connection with the disappearance; after being released from prison for the sexual assault of his four daughters, he had moved to Carvoeiro, Portugal, not far from Praia da Luz, and was there when Madeleine went missing. Another focus of Operation Grange was Urs Hans von Aesch, a deceased Swiss man who had been living in Spain when Madeleine disappeared; Aesch was implicated in the murder of five-year-old Ylenia Lenhard, who disappeared in Switzerland three months after Madeleine and was later found poisoned. In June 2016 Operation Grange officers interviewed a victim of the deceased broadcaster Clement Freud, who was accused that year of having a history of child sexual abuse. Freud had had a home in Praia da Luz, and had befriended the McCanns in July 2007, weeks after the disappearance. His family said he was in the UK when Madeleine went missing.\\n\\nSection::::Tabloids and social media.\\nSection::::\"Trial by media\".\\nEilis O\\'Hanlon wrote that the disappearance \"could almost stand as a metaphor for the rise of social media as the predominant mode of public discourse\". Twitter, one year old when Madeleine went missing, became the source of much of the vitriol against the McCanns. Ten years later, the McCann hashtag was still producing over 100 tweets an hour, according to researchers at the University of Huddersfield. Social media\\'s attacks included a threat to kidnap one of the McCanns\\' twins, and when Scotland Yard and \"Crimewatch\" staged their reconstruction in 2013, there was apparently talk of phoning in with false information to sabotage the appeal. One man who ran an anti-McCann website received a three-month suspended sentence in 2013 after leafleting their village with his allegations. The following year a Twitter user was found dead from a helium overdose after Sky News confronted her about her 400 anti-McCann tweets.\\n\\nThe couple\\'s status as photogenic, articulate and professional was at first beneficial and protective. A white middle-class family caught up in a nightmare of evil abroad offered everything the media could latch onto, writes feminist scholar Nicola Rehling, and every institution in the UK wanted to help, from 10 Downing Street down. The McCanns took full advantage of the interest by hiring public-relations consultants and offering regular events to give the media a daily news peg. But the frenzy soon turned against them, and there began what PR consultant Michael Cole called the \"monstering of the McCanns\". They were harshly criticized for having left their children alone in an unlocked apartment, despite the availability of Ocean Club babysitters and a crèche. The argument ran that a working-class couple would have faced child-abandonment charges. Seventeen thousand people signed an online petition in June 2007 asking Leicestershire Social Services to investigate how the children came to be left unattended.\\n\\nKate McCann\\'s appearance and demeanour were widely discussed, with much of the commentary coming from other women, including Booker Prize-winner Anne Enright in the \"London Review of Books\". Kate was deemed cold and controlled, too attractive, too thin, too well-dressed, too intense. She had apparently been advised by abduction experts not to cry on camera because the kidnapper might enjoy her distress, and this led to more criticism: the Portuguese tabloid \"Correio da Manhã\" cited sources complaining that she had not \"shed a single tear\". Journalism professor Nicola Goc argued that Kate had joined a long list of mothers deemed killers because of unacceptable maternal behaviour. Commentators compared her experience to that of Lindy Chamberlain, convicted of murder after her baby was killed by a dingo. Like Kate, she was suspected, in part, because she had not wept in public. There was even a similar (false) story about supposedly relevant Bible passages the women were said to have highlighted. Chamberlain asked: \"How can you apologise to me and do this again to someone else?\"\\n\\nIn November 2011 the McCanns testified before the Leveson Inquiry into British press standards. The inquiry heard that the editor of the \"Daily Express\", in particular, had become \"obsessed\" with the couple. \"Express\" headlines included that Madeleine had been \"killed by sleeping pills\", \"Find body or McCanns will escape\", and McCanns or a friend must be to blame, the latter based on an interview with a waiter. \"Maddie \\'Sold\\' By Hard-Up McCanns\" ran a headline in the \"Daily Star\", part of the Express group. Lord Justice Leveson called the articles \"complete piffle\". Roy Greenslade described them as \"no journalistic accident, but a sustained campaign of vitriol against a grief-stricken family\".\\n\\nSection::::Libel actions.\\nIn addition to the McCanns\\' legal efforts against Gonçalo Amaral and his publisher, the McCanns and Tapas Seven brought libel actions against several newspapers. The \"Daily Express\", \"Daily Star\" and their sister Sunday papers, owned by Northern & Shell, published front-page apologies in 2008 and donated £550,000 to Madeleine\\'s Fund. The Tapas Seven were awarded £375,000 against the Express group, also donated to Madeleine\\'s Fund, along with an apology in the \"Daily Express\". The McCanns received £55,000 from \"The Sunday Times\" in 2013 when the newspaper implied that they had withheld e-fits from the police.\\n\\nRobert Murat received £600,000 in out-of-court settlements for libel in relation to 100 articles published by 11 newspapers—\"The Sun\" and \"News of the World\" (News International), \"Daily Express\", \"Sunday Express\" and \"Daily Star\" (Northern & Shell), \"Daily Mail\", \"London Evening Standard\" and \"Metro\" (Associated Newspapers), \"Daily Mirror\", \"Sunday Mirror\" and \"Daily Record\" (Mirror Group Newspapers). According to \"The Observer\", it was the largest number of separate libel actions brought in the UK by the same person in relation to one issue. His two associates were each awarded $100,000, and all three received public apologies.

The population was 203 at the 2010 census.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe community was named for President Benjamin Harrison, due to a large wood mill and stop for mining boats coming off the nearby Coeur d\\'Alene River.\\n\\nHarrison was incorporated in 1899 and was once the largest city on Lake Coeur d\\'Alene.\\n\\nHarrison developed from a squatters homestead to a thriving village in about twelve years. A branch of the O.R. & N. Railroad from Tekoa, Washington, to Harrison was completed in 1890 and was a prime factor in the development of Harrison.\\n\\nIn 1891, Silas W. Crane settled on a timbered tract which joins the present city on the south and east. He built the first house in Harrison which remained in the Crane family until 1936. The building is now used as the Crane House Museum. The same year Fred Grant purchased the Fisher Brothers Sawmill in St. Maries and moved it to Harrison. Known as Grants Mill, it had a capacity of 60 thousand feet per day.\\n\\nIn 1892, S.W. Crane opened a general store. The first post office was established in 1893, the name was chosen and W.E. Crane became the first postmaster. W.S. Bridgeman opened a Gen. Merc. in 1893, and another general store was opened in 1894 by W.A. Reiniger.\\n\\nThe first newspaper, \"The Signal\", was established in 1895, later it was known as the \"Mountain Messenger\" and in 1900 became known as \"The Searchlight\". A paper with that name is still published annually by the Oldtime Picnic Committee.\\n\\nIn 1895, a Methodist church was erected and School District #29 was formed. The first year of school was taught by Mr. Edelbute in the Methodist Church. The first school was erected in 1896 and by 1903 there were 59 students.\\n\\nThe original townsite was in the form of a triangle and covered approximately . The Village of Harrison was incorporated on July 21, 1899. The first meeting of the Board of Trustees for the Village of Harrison was held July 24, 1899. George W. Thompson was elected chairman.\\n\\nIn August 1905, a Spokane company was granted a franchise to put in a water system with a pumping plant at a cost of $20,000. An electric light plant was also installed in 1901 by Kimmel Brothers at a cost of $8,000.\\n\\nThe following year came the telephone, connecting Harrison with points up the St. Joe and Coeur d’Alene rivers. Rocky Mountain Bell purchased the property later that year and Harrison was connected to outside world.\\n\\nThe next few years saw the opening of the First National Bank of Harrison, the Opera House, various drug, grocery, hardware, furniture, clothing & jewelry stores along with tailoring, blacksmithing and shoemaker shops, and restaurants, hotels and a hospital. For a time around the turn of the century, Harrison was the largest town in Kootenai County; the city directory in 1911 reported a population of 1,250. Harrison\\'s growth was a result of the development of eight or more sawmills & box factories. With the mills and woods jobs, approx. 280 men were employed with a combined monthly payroll around $25,000. Millions of board feet of timber were stored in the lake at Harrison. Lake Coeur d’Alene and the St.Joe and Coeur d’Alene rivers were the major transportation routes for timber coming out of the areas forests.\\n\\nIn 1917, the Grant Lumber Company caught fire and the ensuing blaze consumed about half of the residential area of Harrison and about half of the business district. Much of the town was never rebuilt. The easiest way to get to Harrison was by water. The OWR&N Company which absorbed the OR&N railroad, constructed a 600-passenger steamer called “The Harrison” for transportation. There were several other steamers such as the Georgie Oakes that carried pas-sengers and freight making the depot a popular place for area children. Passenger service was discontinued in the early 1920s but they continued to haul freight until 1932 when the line was abandoned.\\n\\nMany early day photos are on display at the Crane Historical Society Museum along with a lot of information about Harrison. Community spirit continues today with the Old Time Picnic, which is always held the last weekend in July.\\n\\nHarrison\\'s trail head for the Trail of the Coeur d\\'Alenes rail trail is a welcome addition to the area and helps to keep the town \"alive\" during the off season of lake traffic. The Trail is of easy riding and runs from Plummer to Mullan on the former right-of-way of the Union Pacific Railroad.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nHarrison is located at (47.449779, -116.780674).\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the city has a total area of , of which is land and is water.\\n\\nHarrison is located south of Interstate 90 on the Lake Coeur d\\'Alene Scenic Byway, Highway 97.\\n\\nThe Coeur d\\'Alene River flows into Lake Coeur d\\'Alene on Harrison\\'s northern edge. The lower reaches of the river\\'s valley are filled with smaller lakes, and as such water dominates much of the local geography. The Saint Joe Mountains of the Bitterroot Range rise high above the flat lakes around Harrison.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nSection::::2010 census.\\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 203 people, 100 households, and 54 families residing in the city.

Honyaki as a term alone can refer to either mizu honyaki (water-quench) or abura honyaki (oil quench). The goal is to produce a sharper, longer lasting edge than is usually achievable with the lamination method. The term has been adapted to describe high-end mono-stainless in Japan and carbon blades by non-Japanese bladesmiths that have a hamon but are made with Western steel, heat treat, equipment, finishing (etching and polishing), and design.\\n\\nSection::::Traditional process.\\nFuel and steel: Pine charcoal is cut to size for use in the fire as gentle heat for the blade before quench. Coke is the most common fuel to forge the blade to shape and is preheated to remove remaining sulfur and phosphorus. Gas is cheaper and may also be used but may yield lower quality, whereas pine charcoal may yield higher quality but it is more expensive. An electric fan is used or a box bellow to feed air into the forge. The steel is usually one of the carbon knife steels Hitachi produces at Yasugi Specialty Steel. These are the unalloyed White steel (1, 2, 3) and the tungsten and chromium alloyed Blue steel (1, 2, Super), with White 2 the most common and Blue 2 the next most produced. Less common is White 1 and White 3 and rarely used is Blue Super used (because it is much harder to forge due the resiliency to stretching from the alloying), and even less common is tamahagane (as the steel is expensive, much more difficult to process, and must be correctly forge welded and flattened).\\n\\nSteel qualities and quenchant: Blacksmith skill aside and specific heat treatment aside, the 1 versions (higher carbon) are harder, more wear resistant, more fragile and harder to forge, harder to sharpen, and harder to straighten.. The 3 versions (lower carbon, at the eutectoid point) are not necessarily softer, but often tougher, easier to sharpen, and easier to make. Blue steel is more difficult to forge, sharpen, and straighten (because the \"soft\" steel covered by clay still hardens). To perform traditional water quench on this steel can exacerbate the formation of cracks because of its deeper hardening. White steel 1 is difficult to forge and to quench from its higher carbon and can become harder and more brittle than White 2. A water quench with these traditional steels and processes will result in a blade that is harder, stiffer, sharper with longer lasting sharpness but that is harder to sharpen and relatively less tough. An oil quench with the same steels will result in a blade that is marginally less hard, stiff, sharp with less lasting sharpness but that is easier to sharpen and more tough. The choice of quenchant depends on user preference of blade qualities.\\n\\nForging: Unlike awase bocho, honyaki in general have no need to raise to forge welding heat. This skips the possible carbon migration to the mild steel and decarburization from the heating to around 1000 degrees Celsius. Furthermore, the smith skips the need to weld the layers careful under careful heating and to evenly forge the core steel. In this regard to forging white 2 steel, honyaki is easier than in awase bocho. More alloy and higher carbon make this more difficult. There are multiple re-heatings and forging from high temperatures downward. Blades are cooled and annealed in carbonized rice straw or ash, cut to rough shape, cold forged, and corrected for distortion multiple times. They are preferably left to stabilize for a bit between each step to help reduce distortion. The knife is rough ground to shape with the omote, urasuki, and profile. These steps generally require more effort than with laminated knives.\\n\\nQuenching: A paste is applied to the blade using water, charcoal, clay, ground natural sharpening stone, and other ingredients in a proprietary way and composition. This thicker paste goes on the blade spine on both sides and traditionally mimics the wavy hamon of nihonto. A thinner slip goes on the hard edge to help heat transfer there. It then must dry in air or over heat. The quench water or oil is prepared and brought to the right temperature. The forge is heated. Lights are turned off and the room shut from the outside. Once ready, the blade is buried and shuffled around in the charcoal and when it reaches the correct temperature it is thrust into water and moved forward and back (so as to prevent lateral distortion) and then after a couple seconds side to side. The knife could also be brought up slightly above temperature and then held in the room to the correct temperature before quench. The quench could be interrupted toward the end for more rough grinding or to correct distortion. The blade is tempered either immediately over fire, or in oil, or in an oven. The water quench regularly destroys many blades by cracking them or warping them too badly to reasonably sell.\\n\\nSharpening and finishing: It is preferably left to sit while the knife age hardens so that when the knife is made straight, few if any distortions appear as the knife ages further. If is made under the Sakai, Osaka production system, the knife is sent to a sharpener who corrects for distortion and sharpnens simultaneously to make the final geometry and profile of the knife, and then finished by polishing, engraving, and installation of handle by other craftsmen. It may be mirror polished or finished with natural stones to highlight the hamon, resist rusting, and improve balance and some honyaki display alloy banding upon polish. The handle is installed and a saya is usually made. Ebony fittings denote ornamental display as the wood is hard enough to scratch the blade in the saya and the ebony can crack under changes in humidity, and the extra weight may make holding the knife more tiring but can help balance with longer blades. If used for work, it represents the status of the cost and knowledge of proper care and use. The extra labor in manufacture, sharpening, and finishing, time lost to failed blades, and skill in temperature control and forging contributes to the higher price compared to usual laminated blades.\\n\\nSection::::Culture and use.\\nCraftsman: Honyaki is the application of Japanese swordsmithing tradition. Blacksmithing backgrounds (specialty, personality, geography, family lineage, teacher, knowledge, money, tradition, business structure) differ and accordingly produce different interpretation of the technique. It usually represents the best work of all craftsmen involved.\\n\\nChef: Traditionally chefs first learn to use stainless, then kasumi, hon-kasumi, and finally mizu or abura honyaki. The honyaki knives are usually used only after completion of an apprenticeship after becoming proficient in ingredients, cooking, sharpening, and knife use. Honyaki knives are usually harder to sharpen in comparison to laminated blades because they have no mild steel that is quickly removed and are usually even harder. They usually chip more easily in use and sharpening and are extra sensitive to hard surfaces including in sharpening. As the edge is more fragile, the user must know how to hold, cut, sharpen, store, and care for it.\\n\\nLaminated vs Honyaki: From a strictly heat treat and microscopy point of view, there should be no difference between a laminated and honyaki steel with the same observed structure and heat threat process, but the heat treat necessarily differs, and many users say there is benefit to honyaki. Many users also prefer laminated blades for ease of maintenance, sharpening feel, cost, and toughness. Many blacksmiths prefer laminated blades because at the minimum, they are easier to produce. At the highest levels they have core steel of comparable hardness and sharpness and are not necessarily easier to make due to the skill to forge weld at lower temperatures, with minimal loss of carbon, less flux and iron powder, and with minimal scars while stretching out the laminate. Pattern welding (suminagashi) requires its own skill as well and can produce a stiffer awase knife with less distortion during use and sharpening.\\n\\nSection::::Makers and brands.\\nAs Sakai is the kitchen knife capital of Japan, many honyaki come from there.\\n\\nBrands that offer honyaki include Akifusa, Aritsugu, Ashi Hamono, Carter Cutlery, Fudo Kuniyuki, Gesshin, Ino, Ittotsai Kotetsu, Kikuichimonji, Hiromoto, Konosuke, Masamoto Sohonten, Masamoto Tsukiji, Minamoto Izumimasa, Mizuno Tanrenjo, Monzaburo, Nenohi, Sakai Takayuki, Singatirin, Suisin, Sukenari, Tesshu, Tsubaya, Yamamoto Haken (Hide), Yoshihiro/Yamawaki.\\n\\nBlacksmiths who have produced honyaki include Futoshi Nagao, Genkai, Hiroki Ashi, Kenichi Shiraki, Kenji Togashi, Kiyoshi Kato, Jyunichi Takagi, Okishiba Masakuni, Tatsuo Ikeda, Watanabe, Yasha Yukawa, and Yoshikazu Ikeda.\\n\\nStainless \"honyaki\" (actually zenko) include Suisin Inox Honyaki and Masahiro MV Honyaki.\\n\\nMakers of Western style \"honyaki\" include Cris Anderson, Mert Tansu, Bill Burke, Bryan Raquin, William Catchside, and Bob Kramer.\\n', 'title': 'Honyaki', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11077547'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'OhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11078032', 'text': '2005 Fed Cup World Group II\\n\\nThe World Group II was the second highest level of Fed Cup competition in 2005.

Eaton co-founded the Rensselaer School in 1824 with Stephen van Rensselaer III \"in the application of science to the common purposes of life\". His books in the eighteenth century were among the first published for which a systematic treatment of the United States was attempted, and in a language that all could read. His teaching laboratory for botany in the 1820s was the first of its kind in the country. Eaton\\'s popular lectures and writings inspired numerous thinkers, in particular women, whom he encouraged to attend his public talks on experimental philosophy. Emma Willard would found the Troy Female Seminary (Emma Willard School), and Mary Mason Lyon, the Mount Holyoke Female Seminary (Mount Holyoke College). Eaton held the rank of senior professor at Rensselaer until his death in 1842.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nAmos Eaton was born at Chatham, Columbia County, New York on May 17, 1776. His father, Captain Abel Eaton was a farmer of comfortable means. He belonged to a family that traced its lineage to John Eaton, who arrived from Dover, England in 1635, settling two years later in Dedham, Massachusetts Bay Colony. Amos Eaton showed early preference for nature, by the age of sixteen constructing his own compass and chain to survey land as a chain bearer.\\n\\nEaton was sent to Williamstown with the Rev. Dr. David Potter, of Spencertown, to study at Williams College. After graduating in 1799 with high marks in natural philosophy, he married the daughter of Malachi and Mary (née McCall) Thomas in October the same year, who died in 1802, leaving him a son. He arranged to study in the legal profession, studying law with the Hon. Elisha Williams, of Spencertown, and the Hon. Josiah Ogden, of New York, receiving admittance to the bar of the Supreme Court of New York. An association that he formed in New York with Dr. David Hosack and Dr. Samuel L. Mitchell, marked another determining point in his career; for, under their instruction, Eaton, became committed to the natural sciences, and in particular botany. Eaton practiced as a lawyer and as a land agent in Catskill, New York until 1810, when he was jailed on charges of forgery, spending nearly five years in prison. On his release in 1815, Eaton removed to New Haven at Yale College to take up the study of botany, chemistry and mineralogy under the tuition of Benjamin Silliman and Eli Ives. He then returned to Williams College to offer a course of lectures and volunteer classes of the students on botany, mineralogy zoology, and geology and published a botanical dictionary. In 1817, he published his \"Manual of Botany for the Northern States\", the first comprehensive flora of the area; it ultimately went through eight editions. From Williams College the lectures were extended, in the shape of courses, with practical instructions to classes, to the larger towns of New England and New York.\\n\\nHe returned to New York State in 1818 to Albany on DeWitt Clinton\\'s preparations for him to deliver a series of lectures to the New York State Legislature on the state\\'s geology in connection with the building of the Erie Canal and agriculture. Among the legislators who heard these lectures was Stephen Van Rensselaer III, patroon of Rensselaerswyck, who, in 1820, hired him to produce \"A geological Survey of the County of Albany\", which was followed by geological surveys of much of the area through which the canal was built. Ultimately, Eaton would complete a survey of a section fifty miles wide from Buffalo to Boston.\\n\\nEaton delivered talks at the Lenox Academy and the Medical College at Castleton, Vermont, where he was appointed professor of natural history in 1820. He gave lectures and practical instructions in Troy, laying the foundation as a result of his work, of the Lyceum of Natural History. In 1820 and 1821, Eaton initiated geological and agricultural surveys of Albany and Rensselaer counties at the expense of Van Rensselaer. Eaton\\'s efforts led Troy as a depository of an extensive collection of geological specimens and comprehensive land surveys.\\n\\nSection::::Rensselaer School.\\nAfter co-founding the Rensselaer School in 1824, Van Rensselaer appointed Eaton to teach chemistry, experimental philosophy, geology, surveying, and the \"laws regulating town officers and jurors.\" By then Eaton was a well established public speaker on natural philosophy, touring and delivering lectures in the northeast. He was also a recognized pioneer in botany and principal land surveyor in the country. Eaton immediately set about to develop a new kind of institution devoted to the application of science to life, to a modern scientific prospectus, to new methods of instruction and examination, to recognize women in higher education a possibility, and to be practical in training for adults. Eaton\\'s original aim was to also train teachers and disciples, which he did in large numbers. Students learned by doing, in sharp contrast with the conventional method of learning by rote. Students were made into experimenters and workers, and, in place of recitations, delivered lectures to one another. Eaton also often led day excursions, taking students to observe the application of science on nearby farms and in workshops, tanneries, and bleaching factories. They then returned to the laboratory, analyzing the principles involved. This, too, was an innovation, as it represented a reversal of the usual pedagogical method, which began with the principle and proceeded to the application. Eaton\\'s principal focus was the training of students to teach science and its applications to the New York farming community via experimental demonstrations, a goal in keeping with Britain\\'s mechanics\\' institutes and lyceum movements on diffusing useful knowledge. As a result, Eaton\\'s system of instruction posed a challenge, if not a threat, to the traditional liberal-arts colleges, causing them to expand their own curricula and set up departments or schools of engineering and science. Formal engineering education would not be added at Rensselaer until 1828. After becoming professor of natural history at Harvard University in 1842, Asa Gray required some practical work of all of his students in botany along the lines established by Amos Eaton. Under his leadership, Troy, New York rivaled London, England as a center for geological studies in the first part of the 19th century.\\n\\nEaton was interested in education for women, he had lectured them on his tour of New England, and he was persuaded that their failure in science was caused by inferior opportunity, not \"perversion of female genius.\" Eaton, clearly hoped to educate females at the school. He believed that women were capable of learning practical science and mathematics; they simply had not been taught the subjects at traditional female academies. His commitment to the cause led Eaton to enroll a class of eight young women in a special mathematics course to show that they could advance beyond \"the speculative geometry and algebra as generally practiced in female seminaries.\" When the students completed their course of study in 1835, Eaton requested a review of their progress by the school\\'s less-than-enthusiastic board of examiners. The eight young ladies who participated in Eaton\\'s experiment continued their education at the Troy Female Seminary. Eaton trained a bevy of future, notable, scientists and lectured to countless later educationists.\\n\\nToday Amos Eaton Hall houses the mathematics department, and the Amos Eaton Professorship is a faculty endowment named at the institute. The Amos Eaton Chair was originally given by students to Amos Eaton in 1839, but was later returned to the institute by the Eaton family.\\n\\nSection::::Personal life.\\nFollowing the death of his first wife, Polly Thomas, Eaton was remarried to Sally Cady in 1803, who bore him five sons. After her death he was remarried to Anna Bradley in 1816, by whom he had three sons and two daughters. She having died, Eaton married Alice Johnson in 1827, who bore him one son, and survived him about four years. Three of his children showed a preference for natural philosophy. Hezekiah Hulbert Eaton (1809-1832) became a chemist at Transylvania University but died at the age of twenty-three. Major General Amos Beebe Eaton (1806-1877) was a U.S. Army officer interested in natural philosophy. Sara Cady Eaton (1818-1881) taught natural sciences and modern languages in a young woman\\'s seminary at Monticello, Illinois. Eaton\\'s grandson, Daniel Cady Eaton (1834-1895), professed botany at Yale College in the 1860s.\\n\\nSection::::Works.\\nAmos Eaton published on agriculture, botany, engineering, geology, surveying, and zoology. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Amos Eaton', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1108089'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'PhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11081302', 'text': 'San Francisco Fog (soccer)\\n\\nThe San Francisco Fog was a Major Indoor Soccer League franchise which existed for only one season, 1980–1981.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Fog, which played their home games at the Cow Palace, finished their single season of existence at 11–29.

It was effectively replaced in 1951 with the launch of Ford UK\\'s Zephyr Six and Consul models, though V8 Pilots were still offered for sale, being gradually withdrawn during that year. In its production run 22,155 cars were made.\\n\\nSection::::Engine and running gear.\\nThe Pilot was the first large post-war British Ford. It was based on the pre-war 22 bhp Model 62 chassis, and was initially offered in 1946 with the 2227\\xa0cc side-valve V8 60 engine from the 1939 model. . This engine was totally inadequate for the vehicle size and was quickly replaced by the E71A Dagenham 30hp engine: \\'Enfo\\' (English Ford) Dagenham cast their own version of the US 1937 Model 78, 21 stud, 30 indicated hp, 221 cubic inch/3.6 litre block and probably all ancillaries, most of which had ENFO part numbers. This was the E71A engine. which has many differences to the US 1937 engine such as; the block had one frost plug at rear on each side, just below the heads, the heads had the firing order cast in, the crankshaft had a long snout allowing double pulley fan belts for trucks, Big End bearings were flanged 1/4 shells (4 per journal), no US engine had these. The sump, on most, was also different, it had a pear shaped locating hole to accommodate the Lucas starter. Exhaust manifolds had a nice flowing design, a rare improvement on US versions.\\n\\nThe E71 30hp 3622\\xa0cc engine developed 81 hp, with a stroke of 3. 3/4\" and a bore of 3.1/16\" and fed by a single Solex carburettor. This engine, with twin sheave belt pulleys, was also used in Thames trucks.\\n\\nThe gears are changed by means of a gear lever on the steering column. The gearbox has three forward ratios and one reverse. Steering uses a form of worm and roller mechanism called a Marles steering box, which has an \"hour-glass cam and a double roller\". The car was considered rather old-fashioned even when new, but its front brakes are hydraulically operated. The rear brakes are cable-operated.\\n\\nThe Pilot was built with 6-volt Lucas electrics including the starter & generator. A twin exhaust system was standard providing a quality sound.\\n\\nThe wide stud pattern 16\" wheels were the same as 1936 to 1939 US cars. Front & rear Brake drums were ENFO made but same dimensions as the 1936 US Model 68.\\n\\nMost Pilots were four-door saloons, based on the 1935 USA Model 48, but Estate (Shooting Brake (Woody)) and pick-up versions were built, the latter for export only. The chromed brass front windscreen can be opened for ventilation, pivoted about a top hinge. Leather upholstery was standard, all interior window frame trim & the dashboard were made of Bakelite plastic. Trafficators, (indicators) were standard issue with a hydraulic four jack system optional. Production ended in 1951 when Ford replaced the Pilot with the Zephyr.\\n\\nLike other Fords of its era, the Pilot had vacuum-driven wipers powered from the engine manifold with a vacuum reservoir tank improving performance under load whereas US cars without the reservoir option tended to work much more slowly or even stop under full throttle or under load. The car was reputed to accelerate from 0 to in 21 seconds, have a top speed of , and return .\\n\\nWAR PRODUCTION of the E71A Engine. as quoted in \\'The Illustrated History Of Ford Trucks & PSVs by Michael Allen & Les Geary.

Among them was the British ship \"Eliza Russell\", the capture of which caused a diplomatic incident as Texas was seeking official recognition from the United Kingdom. When \"Brutus\" returned to Galveston to face official sanctions, Mexican ships attacked her and \"Invincible\"; both ran aground in Galveston harbor and were battered apart by storms. With the destruction of \"Brutus\", the first Texas Navy ceased to exist.\\n\\nSection::::As a private warship.\\nAt the beginning of the Texas War of Independence, businessmen John and Augustus Allen endeavored to keep the Texans\\' supply channels open. At their own expense, they outfitted a ship called \"Brutus\" for the purpose of protecting the Texas coast and assisting troops and supplies from the United States to arrive safely in Texas.\\n\\nIn January 1836, the Allen brothers sold \"Brutus\" to the Texas Navy, and it became the second ship in the fledgling fleet of schooners.\\n\\nSection::::In the Texas Navy.\\nCaptain William A. Hurd took command of \"Brutus\" when she was commissioned into the small Texas Navy on 25 January 1836, in New Orleans. She did not reach Texan waters again until early February 1836.\\n\\nAfter the Battle of San Jacinto, \"Brutus\" put in at New Orleans for supplies and to be refitted. Upon returning to sea duty, Brutus found herself blockaded at Matagorda by the Mexican brig \"Vencedor del Álamo\". Word was sent to Galveston and \"Invincible\", along with the private ships \"Ocean\" and \"Union\", successfully broke the blockade and Captain Hurd was able to take \"Brutus\" to New York City for repairs. This was apparently done without consulting Commodore Charles Hawkins who promptly sacked Hurd as commander upon his return from New York in April 1837.\\n\\nSection::::Yucatan campaign.\\nJames D. Boylan was appointed Captain of the \"Brutus\" and he acted with vigor. He immediately escorted the supply ship \"Texas\" from Galveston to Matagorda and returned by midnight the same day, 10 June 1837. Within an hour \"Brutus\" was back at sea on a mission to harry Mexican commercial shipping at the mouth of the Mississippi River. Before arriving on post, \"Brutus\" was ordered to join \"Invincible\" and move to the Yucatan peninsula. \"Invincible\" under the command of Commodore Hawkins, had aboard the Texas Secretary of the Navy, Samuel Rhoads Fisher. Fisher had personally witnessed the surrender of \"Independence\" at Matagorda in April 1837. Determined to show the value of the navy, Fisher took to sea with the last two ships of the Texas Navy.\\n\\n\"Brutus\" and \"Invincible\" reached the Yucatan on 8 July 1837 and sailed to Isla Mujeres, which they claimed for Texas.\\nThe ships cruised off the Yucatan coast attacking shipping and towns with abandon. By 16 July, the two Texas schooners made prizes of the \"Union\", the \"Telégrafo\", and the \"Adventure\" off Sisal and on 26 July they engaged the batteries defending Campeche\\'s harbor. Describing the attack on that city, Tom Wells writes, \"Continuing up the Yucatan coast, the expedition boarded ships and landed shore parties until finally they were attacked by a cavalry force and driven back to their ships. The Texans burned two villages in reprisal, then tried to force Campeche to pay $25,000 in tribute. However, the city was surrounded by heavy stone walls and was well-fortified. After an inconclusive three-hour exchange of gunfire, the two ships departed.\" After the unsuccessful attempt to extort money from Campeche, the tiny flotilla sailed north and captured the \"Obispo\" and the British vessel \"Eliza Russell\" off the Alacranes and then doubled back down the Yucatan coast and then, on 12 August, captured the \"Correo de Tabasco\". The seizure of the \"Eliza Russell\" proved to be a diplomatic incident of some note, almost resulting in the United Kingdom\\'s refusal to recognize the Republic of Texas. The ships, running low on water, started back to Galveston, but not before \"Brutus\" captured \"Rafaelita\" on 17 August and blockaded Matamoros.\\n\\nSection::::Final struggle.\\nOn 27 August 1837, both ships arrived in Galveston and \"Brutus\" crossed the sandbar and entered Galveston harbor. \"Invincible\" delayed and was caught by two Mexican brigs of war, the \"Iturbide\" and \"Libertador\". \"Brutus\" made ready to join \"Invincible\" in the battle but she ran aground on a sandbar. \"Invincible\" also ran aground and was destroyed by the breakers. \"Brutus\" survived but would never be floated again.

The name literally means \"apple slices\" in Danish, although apples are not usually an ingredient in present-day versions. Somewhat similar in texture to European pancakes crossed with a popover or Yorkshire pudding, æbleskiver are solid like a pancake but light and fluffy like a popover. The English language spelling is usually aebleskiver or ebleskiver.\\n\\nSection::::Æbleskiver pan.\\nÆbleskiver are cooked on the stove top by baking in a special pan with several hemispherical indentations. The pan exists in versions for gas and electrical stoves (the latter with a plain bottom). Pans are usually made of cast iron, allowing good heat retention. Traditional models in hammered copper plate exist but are today used primarily for decoration.\\n\\nSection::::Preparation.\\nThe batter for æbleskiver usually includes wheat flour, which is mixed with buttermilk, milk or cream, eggs, sugar and a pinch of salt. Some recipes also include fat (usually butter), cardamom and lemon zest to improve taste, and a leavening agent, most often baking powder, but sometimes yeast, to aerate the batter.\\n\\nBatter is poured into the oiled indentations and as the æbleskiver begin to cook, they are turned with a knitting needle, skewer or fork to give the cakes their characteristic spherical shape. They were traditionally cooked with bits of apple (\"æble\") or applesauce inside but these ingredients are very rarely included in modern Danish forms of the dish. Æbleskiver are not sweet themselves but are traditionally served dipped in raspberry, strawberry, black currant or blackberry jam and sprinkled with powdered sugar.\\n\\nÆbleskiver can be bought fried and frozen at supermarkets, only needing heating in an oven.\\n\\nSection::::Traditions.\\nIn Denmark æbleskiver are traditionally eaten during the Christmas season and are often served with gløgg, Scandinavian mulled wine. They are often sold at Christmas markets, charity markets, Scouting functions, local sports gatherings and similar venues. They are also served at children\\'s birthday parties, due to their popularity and easy preparation. Voluntary associations gain profit from preparing them from the pre-fried, frozen stage and selling them, usually three at a time, with the usual condiments.\\n\\nIn North America there are several annual events that celebrate æbleskiver and Danish culture, with churches and museums holding \"Æbleskiver Suppers\" and similar events.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Æbleskiver', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1108917'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'QxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1109076', 'text': 'Youth of the Progress Party\\n\\nYouth of the Progress Party () is the youth wing of the Progress Party of Denmark.\\n', 'title': 'Youth of the Progress Party', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1109076'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11091644', 'text': 'Spokane (horse)\\n\\nSpokane was a chestnut Thoroughbred stallion foaled in 1886.

He scored Canada's first and only goal from a header in a 1–0 win against Cuba in Havana, during the opening match of the semi-final round of 2014 FIFA World Cup qualification. On February 11, 2013 FIFA ruled that Occéan had committed an act of unsporting conduct, displayed several acts of unsporting behavior, and used offensive language towards match officials during a 2014 World Cup qualifying match against Cuba on October 12, 2012. As part of the ruling, Occéan received a 6-match suspension. It was later determined that only Canada's official competitive matches, not friendlies, count toward the suspension meaning that the earliest that Occéan would be available for selection would be the final of the 2013 CONCACAF Gold Cup, if Canada were to advance that far in the tournament.\\n\\nSection::::Honours.\\nSection::::Norway.\\nLillestrøm SK\\n\\nSection::::Germany.\\nSpVgg Greuther Fürth\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Olivier Occéan', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1109407'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11094380', 'text': 'Enzootic\\n\\nEnzootic is the non-human equivalent of endemic and means, in a broad sense, \"belonging to\" or \"native to\", \"characteristic of\", or \"prevalent in\" a particular geography, race, field, area, or environment; native to an area or scope. \\n\\nIt also has two specific meanings:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Enzootic', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11094380'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11097038', 'text': 'List of Superfund sites in Georgia (U.S. state)\\n\\nThis is a list of Superfund sites in Georgia designated under the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act (CERCLA) environmental law.

One day she starts receiving phone calls from people thinking that she is the popular singer Tianyou. It turns out that someone has leaked 600 phone numbers of famous people to the internet and Yishu's phone number got mixed up in the bunch.\\n\\nWhile Yishu finds it annoying at first, she soon receives a text message from Xiaowen, who is the singer in an amateur rock band. He wishes to write a song for Tianyou and wants Yishu - who he thinks is Tianyou's assistant - to deliver the song to Tianyou. Tianyou is a popular singer, but hasn't had a hit number lately. While she wants to sing for the sake of art, her cruel agent cares only for money and pressures her into recording an album she does not want to record because it doesn't contain any good songs. This decision gets her into a lot of trouble and she is attacked, furthering her personal depression.\\n\\nWhile Yishu hears more of Xiaowen's song through their phone calls and text messages, Yishu is distracted from the problems she attributes to her bad luck. However, Xiaowen conceals the fact he is dying from a terminal illness, thus his desperation to finish his song and have it delivered to Tianyou. Meanwhile, Tianyou has lost interest in singing, since none of the songs she has been forced to record mean anything to her, and she contemplates suicide, a path that her agent secretly delights in because it will mean her unreleased record will sell-out after her death.\\n\\nOn the night that Tianyou is about to commit suicide, Xiaowen calls her cellphone from his hospital bed, having received the correct phone number from Yishu's efforts to find it, and sings her his song. Tianyou is inspired to continue and her career is revitalized; at her next concert, she dedicates the song Xiaowen has written to him and thanks him for saving her before singing it. Tianyou sends Yishu tickets to her concert, for one each for Yishu and Xiaowen, and Yishu invites Xiaowen, hoping to finally meet him. However, at the end of the concert, she finds Xiaowen's bandmates and learns from them that Xiaowen has already died.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': 'The 601st Phone Call', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11097772'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'SRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11098098', 'text': 'Summertime on Icarus\\n\\n\"Summertime on Icarus\" is a science fiction short story by British writer Arthur\\xa0C.

Other sources claim she was from Rome, Jerusalem or Gaul (modern France). According to legend, she performed miraculous healings and converted the Georgian queen, Nana, and eventually the pagan king Mirian III of Iberia, who, lost in darkness and blinded on a hunting trip, found his way only after he prayed to \"Nino’s God\". Mirian declared Christianity the official religion (c. 327) and Nino continued her missionary activities among Georgians until her death.\\n\\nHer tomb is still shown at the Bodbe Monastery in Kakheti, eastern Georgia. St. Nino has become one of the most venerated saints of the Georgian Orthodox Church and her attribute, a grapevine cross, is a symbol of Georgian Christianity.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nMany sources agree that Nino was born in the small town of Colastri, in the Roman province of Cappadocia, although a smaller number of sources disagree with this. On her family and origin, the Roman Catholic Church and the Eastern Orthodox Church have different traditions.\\n\\nAccording to the Eastern Orthodox Church tradition, she was the only child of a famous family. Her father was Roman general Zabulon and her mother Sosana (Susan). On her father\\'s side, Nino was related to St. George, and on her mother\\'s, to the patriarch of Jerusalem, Houbnal I.\\n\\nDuring her childhood, Nino was brought up by the nun Niofora-Sarah of Bethlehem. Nino’s uncle, who was the patriarch of Jerusalem, oversaw her traditional upbringing. Nino went to Rome with the help of her uncle where she decided to preach the Christian gospel in Iberia, known to her as the resting place of Christ’s tunic. According to the legend, Nino received a vision where the Virgin Mary gave her a grapevine cross and said:\\n\\nSaint Nino entered the Iberian Kingdom in Caucasus from the Kingdom of Armenia, where she escaped persecution at the hands of the Armenian King Tiridates III. She had belonged to a community of virgins numbering 35, along with martyr Hripsime, under the leadership of St. Gayane, who preached Christianity in the Armenian Kingdom. They were all, with the exception of Nino, tortured and beheaded by Tiridates. All 35 of the virgins were soon canonised by the Armenian Apostolic Church, including Nino (as St. Nune).\\n\\nContrasting with this, the Roman Catholic tradition, as narrated by Rufinus of Aquileia, says Nino was brought to Iberia not by her own will, but as a slave, and that her family tree is obscure.\\n\\nSection::::St Nino in Iberia.\\nNino reached the borders of the ancient Georgian Kingdom of Iberia from the south about 320. There she placed a Christian cross in the small town of Akhalkalaki and started preaching the Christian faith in Urbnisi, finally reaching Mtskheta (the capital of Iberia). The Iberian Kingdom had been influenced by the neighbouring Persian Empire which played an important role as the regional power in the Caucasus. The Iberian King Mirian III and his nation worshiped the syncretic gods Armazi and Zaden. Soon after the arrival of Nino in Mtskheta, Nana, the Queen of Iberia requested an audience with the Cappadocian.\\n\\nQueen Nana, who suffered from a severe illness, had some knowledge of Christianity but had not yet converted to it. Nino, restoring the Queen\\'s health, won to herself disciples from the Queen\\'s attendants, including a Jewish priest and his daughter, Abiathar and Sidonia. Nana also officially converted to Christianity and was baptized by Nino herself. Mirian, aware of his wife’s religious conversion, was intolerant of her new faith, persecuting it and threatening to divorce his wife if she did not leave the faith. He secluded himself, however, from Nino and the growing Christian community in his kingdom. His isolation to Christianity did not last long because, according to the legend, while on a hunting trip, he was suddenly struck blind as total darkness emerged in the woods. In a desperate state, King Mirian uttered a prayer to the God of St Nino:\\n\\nAs soon as he finished his prayer, light appeared and the king hastily returned to his palace in Mtskheta. As a result of this miracle, the King of Iberia renounced idolatry under the teaching of St Nino and was baptized as the first Christian King of Iberia. Soon, the whole of his household and the inhabitants of Mtskheta adopted Christianity. In 326 King Mirian made Christianity the state religion of his kingdom, making Iberia the second Christian state after Armenia.\\n\\nAfter adopting Christianity, Mirian sent an ambassador to Byzantium, asking Emperor Constantine I to have a bishop and priests sent to Iberia. Constantine, having learned of Iberia’s conversion to Christianity, granted Mirian the new church land in Jerusalem and sent a delegation of bishops to the court of the Georgian King. Roman historian Tyrannius Rufinus in \"Historia Ecclesiastica\" writes about Mirian\\'s request to Constantine:\\n\\nIn 334, Mirian commissioned the building of the first Christian church in Iberia which was finally completed in 379 on the spot where now stands the Svetitskhoveli Cathedral in Mtskheta.\\nNino, having witnessed the conversion of Iberia to Christianity, withdrew to the mountain pass in Bodbe, Kakheti. St Nino died soon after; immediately after her death, King Mirian commenced with the building of monastery in Bodbe, where her tomb can still be seen in the churchyard.\\n\\nNino and its variants remains the most popular name for women and girls in the Republic of Georgia. There are currently 88,441 women over age 16 by that name residing in the country, according to the Georgia Ministry of Justice. It also continues to be a popular name for baby girls.\\n\\nThe Georgian name \"Nino\" is \"Nune\" or \"Nuneh\" in Armenian, thus St. Nino is known as St. Nune in Armenia. Her history as the only one of the 35 nuns of the company of Sts. Gayane and Hripsime to escape the slaughter at the hands of the pagan Armenian King Tiradates III in 301 is recounted in the book \"The History of the Armenians\" by Movses Khorenatzi (Moses of Khoren), which was written about the year 440.\\n\\nSection::::Legacy.\\nThe Sacred Monastery of Saint Nina is the home of a monastic community of Orthodox Christian nuns in the Patriarchate of Georgia.

With over 7,000 items and more than 10,000 individual fragments, the Collection is by far the largest collection of papyrus in the country, and offers a glimpse into the everyday life and language of the ancient world. Of keen interest to historians, linguists, classicists, philosophers, archaeologists, as well as others, the collection includes biblical fragments, religious writings, public and private documents, private letters, and writings on astronomy, astrology, mathematics, and magic. The papyri span nearly two millennia of history, dating from about 1000 BC to AD 1000, with the majority dating from the third century BC to the seventh century AD.\\n\\nMany of the papyri in U-M\\'s collection were written by Greek-speaking people living in Egypt. Their use of common Greek, known as koine, is instructive as to how the ancient dialects gave way to a more standardized language. Although most examples of papyrus originate from Egypt, papyrologists generally study documents which are written in Greek—the official language of the government from the time of Alexander the Great until the Muslim conquest of Egypt.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe Michigan Papyrus Collection was initially developed by Professor Francis W. Kelsey, Chairman of the Department of Latin from 1889 to 1927. While in Italy in 1915, Professor Kelsey learned of the possibility of purchasing papyri from dealers. But, since World War I was in progress, any purchasing had to wait until after the armistice of 1918. Kelsey then traveled to Egypt to acquire papyri. In February 1920, he arrived in Cairo and secured the codex of the Minor Prophets, among many other pieces. Dr. W.W. Bishop, University Librarian of the University of Michigan, was very eager to enlarge the Library\\'s manuscript resources, and assumed responsibility for the housing and care of the papyri, as well as for providing in the Library a work room for those entrusted with their decipherment and publication. \\n\\nAll these papyrus documents provide a unique insight into the ancient world, the social structure of ancient life in general and in detail. The contribution of the papyrus collection has been very important in the understanding of the history of Egypt under Greek and Roman rule, the structure of the society from the Ptolemaic to the Byzantine period, the administration, the personal religious beliefs of individuals, the official religions and their dogmatic clashes, the history of ancient scholarship, the schools, higher education and changes in literary taste over the periods mentioned. Among the most intriguing texts to have been unearthed are passages from sorcerers\\' handbooks that disclose magic spells and give instructions on their proper use.\\n\\nThe collection of papyri is augmented by the University\\'s collection of ostraca, which is housed in the Kelsey Museum of Archaeology. Other ancient materials in the Collection include wood and wax tablets (unique in the ancient world because they were eraseable and re-usable).\\n\\nSection::::Professional Activities and Affiliations.\\nFrom July 29-August 4, 2007, The U-M Papyrus Collection hosted the XXV International Congress of Papyrology. The Congress is an important gathering of international scholars and researchers.\\n\\nThe U-M Papyrus Collection also produces the \"Bulletin of the American Society of Papyrologists\", the only professional journal published in America for the advanced study of papyri and related topics.\\n\\nSection::::Digitization efforts.\\nThe University of Michigan Papyrus Collection has for many years been involved in digitizing its papyrology collection. New technology has aided the study of the fragile materials, making it more easily accessible. The first digital scanner purchased by the U-M Library was used to begin digitizing its papyrus holdings, according to the Winter 2007 issue of \"Search and Discovery: Research at Michigan\".\\n\\nThe University of Michigan, along with UC Berkeley, Columbia, Duke, Princeton, and Yale, is a member of the Advanced Papyrological Information System (APIS), a consortium that is working to digitize the member institutions\\' collections and make them available online. The Michigan APIS database currently has over 35,000 records with images, searchable in a variety of fields including date, language, origin, type of text, author, names of persons, and many more.

In general, a forceps birth is likely to be safer for both the mother and baby than the alternatives — either a ventouse birth or a caesarean section — although caveats such as operator skill apply.\\n\\nAdvantages of forceps use include avoidance of caesarean section (and the short and long-term complications that accompany this), reduction of delivery time, and general applicability with cephalic presentation (head presentation). Common complications include the possibility of bruising the baby and causing more severe tears than would otherwise be the case (although it is important to recognise that almost all women will sustain some form of tear when delivering their first baby). Severe and rare complications (occurring less frequently than 1 in 200) include nerve damage, Descemet\\'s membrane rupture, skull fractures, and cervical cord injury.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nObstetric forceps consist of two branches (blades) that are positioned around the head of the fetus. These branches are defined as left and right depending on which side of the mother\\'s pelvis they will be applied. The branches usually, but not always, cross at a midpoint, which is called the articulation. Most forceps have a locking mechanism at the articulation, but a few have a sliding mechanism instead that allows the two branches to slide along each other. Forceps with a fixed lock mechanism are used for deliveries where little or no rotation is required, as when the fetal head is in line with the mother\\'s pelvis. Forceps with a sliding lock mechanism are used for deliveries requiring more rotation.\\n\\nThe blade of each forceps branch is the curved portion that is used to grasp the fetal head. The forceps should surround the fetal head firmly, but not tightly. The blade characteristically has two curves, the cephalic and the pelvic curves. The cephalic curve is shaped to conform to the fetal head. The cephalic curve can be rounded or rather elongated depending on the shape of the fetal head. The pelvic curve is shaped to conform to the birth canal and helps direct the force of the traction under the pubic bone. Forceps used for rotation of the fetal head should have almost no pelvic curve.\\n\\nThe handles are connected to the blades by shanks of variable lengths. Forceps with longer shanks are used if rotation is being considered.\\n\\nSection::::Anglo-American types.\\nAll American forceps are derived from French forceps (long forceps) or English forceps (short forceps). Short forceps are applied on the fetal head already descended significantly in the maternal pelvis (i.e., proximal to the vagina). Long forceps are able to reach a fetal head still in the middle or even in the upper part of the maternal pelvis. At present practice, it is uncommon to use forceps to access a fetal head in the upper pelvis. So, short forceps are preferred in the UK and USA. Long forceps are still in use elsewhere.\\n\\n\"Simpson forceps\" (1848) are the most commonly used among the types of forceps and has an elongated cephalic curve. These are used when there is substantial molding, that is, temporary elongation of the fetal head as it moves through the birth canal.\\n\\n\"Elliot forceps\" (1860) are similar to Simpson forceps but with an adjustable pin in the end of the handles which can be drawn out as a means of regulating the lateral pressure on the handles when the instrument is positioned for use. They are used most often with women who have had at least one previous vaginal delivery because the muscles and ligaments of the birth canal provide less resistance during second and subsequent deliveries. In these cases the fetal head may thus remain rounder.\\n\\n\"Kielland forceps\" (1915, Norwegian) are distinguished by having no angle between the shanks and the blades and a sliding lock. The pelvic curve of the blades is identical to all other forceps. The common misperception that there is no pelvic curve has become so entrenched in the obstetric literature that it may never be able to be overcome, but it can be proved by holding a blade of Kielland\\'s against any other forceps of one\\'s choice. Kielland forceps are probably the most common forceps used for rotation. The sliding mechanism at the articulation can be helpful in asynclitic births (when the fetal head is tilted to the side) since it is no longer in line with the birth canal. Because the handles, shanks, and blades are all in the same plane the forceps can be applied in any position to affect rotation. Because the shanks and handles are not angled, the forceps cannot be applied to a high station as readily as those with the angle since the shanks impinge on the perineum.\\n\\n\"Wrigley\\'s forceps\" are used in \"low\" or \"outlet deliveries\" (see explanations below), when the maximum diameter is about above the vulva. Wrigley\\'s forceps were designed for use by general practitioner obstetricians, having the safety feature of an inability to reach high into the pelvis. Obstetricians now use these forceps most commonly in cesarean section delivery where manual traction is proving difficult. The short length results in a lower chance of uterine rupture.\\n\\n\"Piper\\'s forceps\" has a perineal curve to allow application to the after-coming head in breech delivery.\\n\\nSection::::Technique.\\nThe cervix must be fully dilated and retracted and the membranes ruptured. The urinary bladder should be empty, perhaps with the use of a catheter. High forceps are never indicated in the modern era. Mid forceps can occasionally be indicated but require operator skill and caution. The station of the head must be at the level of the ischial spines. The woman is placed on her back, usually with the aid of stirrups or assistants to support her legs. A regional anaesthetic (usually either a spinal, epidural or pudendal block) is used to help the mother remain comfortable during the birth. Ascertaining the precise position of the fetal head is paramount, and though historically was accomplished by feeling the fetal skull suture lines and fontanelles, in the modern era, confirmation with ultrasound is essentially mandatory. At this point, the two blades of the forceps are individually inserted, the left blade first for the commonest occipito-anterior position; posterior blade first if a transverse position, then locked. The position on the baby\\'s head is checked. The fetal head is then rotated to the occiput anterior position if it is not already in that position. An episiotomy may be performed if necessary. The baby is then delivered with gentle (maximum 30\\xa0lb or 130 Newton) traction in the axis of the pelvis.\\n\\nSection::::Outlet, low, mid or high.\\nThe accepted clinical standard classification system for forceps deliveries according to station and rotation was developed by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) and consists of:\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe obstetric forceps were invented by the eldest son of the Chamberlen family of surgeons. The Chamberlens were French Huguenots from Normandy who worked in Paris before they migrated to England in 1569 to escape the religious violence in France. William Chamberlen, the patriarch of the family, was most likely a surgeon; he had two sons, both named Pierre, who became maverick surgeons and specialists in midwifery. William and the eldest son practiced in Southampton and then settled in London. The inventor was probably the eldest Peter Chamberlen the elder, who became obstetrician-surgeon of Queen Henriette, wife of King Charles I of England and daughter of Henry IV, King of France. He was succeeded by his nephew, Dr. Peter Chamberlen (barbers-surgeons were not Doctors in the sense of physician), as royal obstetrician. The success of this dynasty of obstetricians with the Royal family and high nobles was related in part to the use of this \"secret\" instrument allowing delivery of a live child in difficult cases.\\nIn fact, the instrument was kept secret for 150 years by the Chamberlen family, although there is evidence for its presence as far back as 1634. Hugh Chamberlen the elder, grandnephew of Peter the eldest, tried to sell the instrument in Paris in 1670, but the demonstration he performed in front of François Mauriceau, responsible for Paris Hotel-Dieu maternity, was a failure which resulted in the death of mother and child. The secret may have been sold by Hugh Chamberlen to Dutch obstetricians at the start of the 18th century in Amsterdam, but there are doubts about the authenticity of what was actually provided to buyers.\\n\\nThe forceps were used most notably in difficult childbirths. The forceps could avoid some infant deaths when previous approaches (involving hooks and other instruments) extracted them in parts. In the interest of secrecy, the forceps were carried into the birthing room in a lined box and would only be used once everyone was out of the room and the mother blindfolded.\\n\\nModels derived from the Chamberlen instrument finally appeared gradually in England and Scotland in 1735. About 100 years after the invention of the forceps by Peter Chamberlen Sr. a surgeon by the name of Jean Palfyn presented his obstetric forceps to the Paris Academy of Sciences in 1723. They contained parallel blades and were called the Hands of Palfyn.\\n\\nThese \"hands\" were possibly the instruments described and used in Paris by Gregoire father and son, Dussée, and Jacques Mesnard. \\n\\nIn 1813, Peter Chamberlen’s midwifery tools were discovered at Woodham Mortimer Hall near Maldon (UK) in the attic of the house. The instruments were found along with gloves, old coins and trinkets. The tools discovered also contained a pair of forceps that were assumed to have been invented by the father of Peter Chamberlen because of the nature of the design.\\n\\nThe Chamberlen family\\'s forceps were based on the idea of separating the two branches of \"sugar clamp\" (as those used to remove \"stones\" from bladder), which were put in place one after another in the birth canal. This was not possible with conventional tweezers previously tested. However, they could only succeed in a maternal pelvis of normal dimensions and on fetal heads already well engaged (i.e. well lowered into maternal pelvis). Abnormalities of pelvis were much more common in the past than today, which complicated the use of Chamberlen forceps. The absence of pelvic curvature of the branches (vertical curvature to accommodate the anatomical curvature of maternal sacrum) prohibited blades from reaching the upper-part of the pelvis and exercising traction in the natural axis of pelvic excavation.\\n\\nIn 1747, French obstetrician Andre Levret, published \"Observations sur les causes et accidents de plusieurs accouchements laborieux\" (\"Observations on the Causes and Accidents of Several difficult Deliveries\"), in which he described his modification of the instrument to follow the \"curvature\" of the maternal pelvis, this \"pelvic curve\" allowing a grip on a fetal head \"still high\" in the pelvic excavation, which could assist in more difficult cases.\\n\\nThis improvement was published in 1751 in England by William Smellie in the book \"A Treatise on the theory and practice of midwifery\". After this fundamental improvement, the forceps would become a common obstetrical instrument for more than two centuries.\\n\\nThe last improvement of the instrument was added in 1877 by a French obstetrician, Stephan Tarnier in \"descriptions of two new forceps.\" This instrument featured a \"traction system\" misaligned with the instrument itself, sometimes called the \"third curvature of the forceps\". This particularly ingenious traction system, allowed the forceps to exercise traction on the head of the child following \"the axis of the maternal pelvic excavation\", which had never been possible before.\\n\\nTarnier\\'s idea was to \"split\" mechanically the grabbing of the fetal head (between the forceps blades) on which the operator does not intervene after their correct positioning, from a mechanical accessory set on the forceps itself, the \"tractor\" on which the operator exercises traction needed to pull down the fetal head in the correct axis of the pelvic excavation. Tarnier forceps (and its multiple derivatives under other names) remained the most widely used system in the world until the development of the cesarean section.\\n\\nForceps had a profound influence on obstetrics as it allowed for the speedy delivery of the baby in cases of difficult or obstructed labour. Over the course of the 19th Century, many practitioners attempted to redesign the forceps, so much so that the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynecologists\\' collection has several hundred examples. In the last decades, however, with the ability to perform a cesarean section relatively safely, and the introduction of the ventouse or vacuum extractor, the use of forceps and training in the technique of its use has sharply declined.\\n\\nSection::::Historical role in the medicalisation of childbirth.\\nThe introduction of the obstetrical forceps provided huge advances in the medicalisation of childbirth. Before the eighteenth century, childbirth was thought of as a medical phase that could be overseen by a female relative. Usually if a doctor had to get involved that meant something had gone wrong. Around this era, (eighteenth century) there were no female doctors. Since males were only exclusively called in under extreme circumstances, the act of childbirth was thought to better known to a midwife or female relative rather than a male doctor. Usually the male doctor’s job was to save the mother’s life if, for example, the baby had become stuck on his or her way exiting the mother. Before the obstetrical forceps, this had to be done by cutting the baby out piece by piece. In other cases, if the baby was deemed undeliverable, then the doctor would use an item called a crochet. This was used to crush the baby’s skull allowing the baby to be pulled out of the mother’s womb. Still in other cases, a caesarean section (c section) could be performed, but this would almost always result in the mother’s death. \"In addition, women who had forceps deliveries had shorter after childbirth complications than those who had caesarean sections performed.\" These procedures came with various risks to the mother’s health along with the death of the baby. However, with the introduction of the obstetrical forceps the male doctor had a more important role. In many cases, they could actually save the baby’s life if called early enough. Although the use of the forceps in childbirth came with its own set of risks, the positives included a significant decrease in risk to the mother, a decrease in child morbidity, and a decrease risk to the baby. The forceps gave male doctors a way to deliver babies. Since the forceps in childbirth were made public around 1720, they gave male doctors a way to assist and even oversee childbirths. Around this time, in large cities some notable being London and Paris, some men would become devoted to obstetrical practices. It became stylish among wealthy women of the era to have their childbirth overseen by male midwives. A notable male midwife was William Hunter. He popularised obstetrics. \"In 1762, he was appointed as obstetrician to Queen Charlotte.\" In addition, with the use of forceps, male doctors invented lying in hospitals to provide safe, somewhat advanced obstetrical care because of the use of the obstetrical forceps.\\n\\nSection::::Historical complications.\\nChild birth was not considered a medical practice before the eighteenth century. It was mostly overseen by a midwife, mother, stepmother, neighbor, or any female relative. \"Around the 19th and 20th Century, childbirth was considered dangerous for women.\" With the introduction of obstetrical forceps, this allowed non-medical professionals, such as the aforementioned individuals, to continue to oversee childbirths. In addition, this gave some of the public more comfort in trusting childbirth oversight to common people. However, the introduction of obstetrical forceps also had a negative effect, because there was no medical oversight of childbirth by any kind of medical professional, this exposed the practice to unnecessary risks and complications for the fetus and mother. These risks could range from minimal effects to lifetime consequences for both individuals. The baby could develop cuts and bruises in various body parts due to the forcible squeezing of his or her body through the mother’s vagina. In addition, there could be bruising on the baby’s face if the forceps\\' handler were to squeeze too tight. In some extreme cases, this could cause temporary or permanent facial nerve injury. Furthermore, if the forceps\\' handler were to twist his or her wrist while the grip was on the baby’s head, this would twist the baby’s neck and cause damage to a cranial nerve, resulting in strabismus. In rare cases, a clavicle fracture to the baby could occur. The addition of obstetrical forceps came with complication to the mother during and after childbirth. The use of the forceps gave rise to an increased risk in cuts and lacerations along the vaginal wall. This, in turn, would cause an increase in post-operative recovery time and increase the pain experienced by the mother. In addition, the use of forceps could cause more difficulty evacuating during the recovery time as compared to a mother who did not use the forceps. While some of these risks and complications were very common, in general, many people overlooked them and continued to use them.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Obstetrical forceps', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11101049'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'UBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11102373', 'text': 'Hōrin-ji\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hōrin-ji', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11102373'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'URhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11105423', 'text': 'Gelenkhüü\\n\\nGelenkhüü (, 1877–1938), full name Khainzangiin Gelenkhüü (\"Хайнзангийн Гэлэнхүү\"), also known as Gelenkhüü Shükherch (\"Гэлэнхүү Шүхэрч\" - Parachute-Gelenkhüü), is a semi-legendary figure from Northern Mongolia.

C. Athavale and the late Ganpat Rao Purohit. At a very young age, he rubbed shoulders with all-time greats at the Bhatkhande College of Music, Lucknow, in the 1930s\\xa0— the first great attempt at institutionalising traditional music instruction. Jog began his training at the age of twelve and was subsequently trained by some of the finest musicians of India, like Baba Allauddin Khan and Pandit S. N. Ratanjankar. Sri Lanka's Pandith Amaradeva studied under Jog. Jog had his early training under Shri Shankar Rao Athavie, Ganpat Rao Purohit, and V. Shastry. Later he received extensive training from Dr.S.N.Ratanjankar and Ustad Allauddin Khan. Subsequently, he was trained by Vishweswar Shastry, by the renowned musician and musicologist Dr. S. N. Ratanjankar, and for a short time by the celebrated Ustad Allauddin Khan.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nJog earned a master's degree in music from Bhatkhande Music Institute in Lucknow in 1944 and went on to teach there. He also taught at the Ali Akbar College of Music. He was a disciple of Baba Allauddin Khan. He performed and recorded with many of the greatest Hindustani musicians of the 20th century (including Bismillah Khan) and toured the world. He frequently performed for All India Radio's Calcutta division.\\n\\nHis book 'Behala Shiksha', published in 1944, is recognized as a major piece of authoritative literature on the subject. He joined All India Radio in 1953 and served as music producer. He had made successful tours to foreign countries and issued many LP and EP gramophone records of both solo performances and jugalbandi with sangeet maestros. He toured extensively both in India and abroad, significantly in East Africa, Nepal, Sri Lanka, United Kingdom, France, the United States, and West Germany. In 1985, he performed to great acclaim under the auspices of the Festival of India in the United States\\n\\nHe received many honors from various cultural institutions, including the Padma Bhushan in 1983 by the president of India\\n. By the time he retired he had risen to deputy chief producer, All India Radio.\\n\\nSection::::Style.\\nTrained in the Gwalior, Agra and Bakhale gharanas, Jog evolved his own characteristic style, which was a blend of gayaki and gatkari, noted for purity of melody and tradition, a formidable layakari ability, dignity, crispness and easy musical communication. He often enlightened audiences according to their taste with lighter themes and folk tunes, flowing with lilting and sparkling grace. His virtuosity, mastery of ragas and uncanny realisation of space and time in the construction and knowledge of rhythm are his hallmarks.\\n\\nJog, whose name is almost synonymous with the violin genre in Hindustani classical music, was a performer with the unique distinction of having occupied the top rungs of the classical musicians' hierarchy with three consecutive generations of performers. His career as a highly active and successful performer spanned almost five decades. An unassuming person of infinite charm, he was also regarded as an incomparable accompanist.<nowiki> His duets with Ustad Bismillah Khan met with spectacular successes in India and abroad.

It primarily infects \"Rubus\" species.\\n\\nIt has been used in the biological control of invasive blackberry species in Chile, Australia, and New Zealand. In 2005, it was discovered growing on Himalayan blackberry plants in Oregon. This accidental introduction does not appear to be infecting native vegetation, so it offers hope for reducing the impact of invasive blackberries in the Pacific Northwest.\\n\\nSection::::Symptoms.\\nThe foliar symptoms that can be found include purple leaf spots along with yellow and tan centers. These can be found on the upper surface of the leaf and can resemble \"Septoria\" leaf spot. On the lower surface of the leaf yellow to orange pustules will be surrounded by a purple tinge. These can resemble cane and leaf rust. The leaves that are severely infected can start to dehydrate as well as start to curl. The leaves that are older and closer to the cane will get infected first and can die as well. The flowers and the fruits that are infected may fail to ripen. Stem infections as well as the continuous defoliation may cause the dieback of the canes. During the summer and fall the infected leaves can start to develop black pustules otherwise known as telia among the uredinia.\\n\\nSection::::Disease Cycle.\\nThe pathogen is a macrocyclic, autoecious rust fungus, and produces five different spore states that represent the asexual and sexual components of the life cycle. Dikaryotic urediniospores are released during the summer as well as the spring while teliospores represent the overwintering stage. When the sexual outcrossing occurs the dikaryotic aeciospores and urediniospores are initiated. The teliospores in the spring will then undergo meiosis in order to produce haploid basidiospores. This follows the insect-mediated transfer of spermatia from the spermogonia of the different types of mating to the receptive hyphae. The spores are spread very easily and can be spread by wind.\\n\\nSection::::Management.\\nCultural tactics along with dormant season lime sulfur can help to reduce the initial inoculums source. The chemical tactics function to protect the healthy younger plant tissues. By removing the old fruiting canes early, after the harvest it will prevent the spreading of the infection. Chemical controls can be effective as well. Chemical protection will need to start by applying lime sulfur to the leaves that are infected. Fungicide application during fall, in the month of September, is the most beneficial for the health of the plant. There may be development of fungal resistance if there is overuse of any single product. The fungicides are primarily protectants therefore, cannot eradicate the disease after it becomes established. The biological control works when an uncharacterized population and or a mixture of strains of a pathogen from the native range of the target weed is released in the area into which the weed is introduced. The strain F15 was released as a biological control agent in 1991 and 1992. The release of the additional strains can originate the potential to increase the genetic diversity of the population of \"P. violaceum\". The occurrence through recombination or the increase in the effective population size can in turn improve the impact of the biological control agent. Biological control agent is likely to be successful, however there is a high potential for the failure of additional strains due to the amount of inoculums involved in the pathogen strain recruitment. The amount of inoculums released is small when compared with the well adapted pathogen that exists in the population\\n\\n', 'title': 'Phragmidium violaceum', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11128241'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'XRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111311', 'text': 'Thawville, Illinois\\n\\nThawville is a village in Ridgeland Township, Iroquois County, Illinois, United States.

Since the latter are strings of numbers, one can view this as a kind of numeral system for representing \"N\", although the main utility is representing a \"k\"-combination by \"N\" rather than the other way around. Distinct numbers correspond to distinct \"k\"-combinations, and produce them in lexicographic order; moreover the numbers less than formula_1 correspond to all \"k\"-combinations of }. The correspondence does not depend on the size\\xa0\"n\" of the set that the \"k\"-combinations are taken from, so it can be interpreted as a map from N to the \"k\"-combinations taken from N; in this view the correspondence is a bijection.\\n\\nThe number \"N\" corresponding to (\"c\"...,\"c\",\"c\") is given by\\n\\nThe fact that a unique sequence so corresponds to any number \"N\" was observed by D. H. Lehmer. Indeed a greedy algorithm finds the \"k\"-combination corresponding to \"N\": take \"c\" maximal with formula_3, then take \"c\" maximal with formula_4, and so forth. Finding the number \"N\", using the formula above, from the \"k\"-combination (\"c\"...,\"c\",\"c\") is also known as \"ranking\", and the opposite operation (given by the greedy algorithm) as \"unranking\"; these operations are known by those names in most computer algebra systems, and in computational mathematics.\\n\\nThe originally used term \"combinatorial representation of integers\" is shortened to \"combinatorial number system\" by Knuth,\\nwho also gives a much older reference;\\nthe term \"combinadic\" is introduced by James McCaffrey (without reference to previous terminology or work).\\n\\nUnlike the factorial number system, the combinatorial number system of degree \"k\" is not a mixed radix system: the part formula_5 of the number \"N\" represented by a \"digit\" \"c\" is not obtained from it by simply multiplying by a place value.\\n\\nThe main application of the combinatorial number system is that it allows rapid computation of the \"k\"-combination that is at a given position in the lexicographic ordering, without having to explicitly list the \"k\"-combinations preceding it; this allows for instance random generation of \"k\"-combinations of a given set. Enumeration of \"k\"-combinations has many applications, among which software testing, sampling, quality control, and the analysis of lottery games.\\n\\nSection::::Ordering combinations.\\nA \"k\"-combination of a set \"S\" is a subset of \"S\" with \"k\" (distinct) elements. The main purpose of the combinatorial number system is to provide a representation, each by a single number, of all formula_1 possible \"k\"-combinations of a set \"S\" of \"n\" elements. Choosing, for any \"n\", } as such a set, it can be arranged that the representation of a given \"k\"-combination \"C\" is independent of the value of \"n\" (although \"n\" must of course be sufficiently large); in other words considering \"C\" as a subset of a larger set by increasing \"n\" will not change the number that represents\\xa0\"C\". Thus for the combinatorial number system one just considers \"C\" as a \"k\"-combination of the set N of all natural numbers, without explicitly mentioning \"n\".\\n\\nIn order to ensure that the numbers representing the \"k\"-combinations of } are less than those representing \"k\"-combinations not contained in }, the \"k\"-combinations must be ordered in such a way that their largest elements are compared first. The most natural ordering that has this property is lexicographic ordering of the \"decreasing\" sequence of their elements. So comparing the 5-combinations \"C\"\\xa0=\\xa0{0,3,4,6,9} and \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>\\xa0=\\xa0{0,1,3,7,9}, one has that \"C\" comes before \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>, since they have the same largest part\\xa09, but the next largest part\\xa06 of \"C\" is less than the next largest part\\xa07 of \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>; the sequences compared lexicographically are (9,6,4,3,0) and (9,7,3,1,0). Another way to describe this ordering is view combinations as describing the \"k\" raised bits in the binary representation of a number, so that \"C\"\\xa0=\\xa0{\"c\"...,\"c\"} describes the number\\n(this associates distinct numbers to \"all\" finite sets of natural numbers); then comparison of \"k\"-combinations can be done by comparing the associated binary numbers. In the example \"C\" and \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki> correspond to numbers 1001011001\\xa0=\\xa0601 and 1010001011\\xa0=\\xa0651, which again shows that \"C\" comes before \"C\"<nowiki>\\'</nowiki>. This number is not however the one one wants to represent the \"k\"-combination with, since many binary numbers have a number of raised bits different from \"k\"; one wants to find the relative position of \"C\" in the ordered list of (only) \"k\"-combinations.\\n\\nSection::::Place of a combination in the ordering.\\nThe number associated in the combinatorial number system of degree \"k\" to a \"k\"-combination \"C\" is the number of \"k\"-combinations strictly less than \"C\" in the given ordering. This number can be computed from \"C\"\\xa0=\\xa0{ \"c\", ..., \"c\", \"c\"\\xa0} with \"c\"\\xa0>\\xa0...\\xa0> \"c\" > \"c\" as follows. From the definition of the ordering it follows that for each \"k\"-combination \"S\" strictly less than\\xa0\"C\", there is a unique index\\xa0\"i\" such that \"c\" is absent from \"S\", while \"c\", ..., \"c\" are present in \"S\", and no other value larger than \"c\" is. One can therefore group those \"k\"-combinations \"S\" according to the possible values 1, 2, ..., \"k\" of \"i\", and count each group separately. For a given value of \"i\" one must include\\n\"c\", ..., \"c\" in \"S\", and the remaining \"i\" elements of \"S\" must be chosen from the \"c\" non-negative integers strictly less than \"c\"; moreover any such choice will result in a \"k\"-combinations \"S\" strictly less than\\xa0\"C\". The number of possible choices is formula_5, which is therefore the number of combinations in group \"i\"; the total number of \"k\"-combinations strictly less than \"C\" then is\\nand this is the index (starting from\\xa00) of \"C\" in the ordered list of \"k\"-combinations. Obviously there is for every \"N\"\\xa0∈\\xa0N exactly one \"k\"-combination at index\\xa0\"N\" in the list (supposing \"k\"\\xa0≥\\xa01, since the list is then infinite), so the above argument proves that every \"N\" can be written in exactly one way as a sum of \"k\" binomial coefficients of the given form.\\n\\nSection::::Finding the \"k\"-combination for a given number.\\nThe given formula allows finding the place in the lexicographic ordering of a given \"k\"-combination immediately. The reverse process of finding the \"k\"-combination at a given place \"N\" requires somewhat more work, but is straightforward nonetheless. By the definition of the lexicographic ordering, two \"k\"-combinations that differ in their largest element \"c\" will be ordered according to the comparison of those largest elements, from which it follows that all combinations with a fixed value of their largest element are contiguous in the list. Moreover the smallest combination with \"c\" as largest element is formula_10, and it has \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa0\"i\"\\xa0−\\xa01 for all \"i\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"k\" (for this combination all terms in the expression except formula_10 are zero). Therefore \"c\" is the largest number such that formula_3. If \"k\"\\xa0>\\xa01 the remaining elements of the \"k\"-combination form the -combination corresponding to the number formula_13 in the combinatorial number system of degree , and can therefore be found by continuing in the same way for formula_13 and instead of \"N\" and \"k\".\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nSuppose one wants to determine the 5-combination at position 72. The successive values of formula_15 for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa04, 5, 6, ... are 0, 1, 6, 21, 56, 126, 252, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 72 is 56, for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa08. Therefore \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa08, and the remaining elements form the 4-combination at position . The successive values of formula_16 for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa03, 4, 5, ... are 0, 1, 5, 15, 35, ..., of which the largest one not exceeding 16 is 15, for \"n\"\\xa0=\\xa06, so \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa06. Continuing similarly to search for a 3-combination at position one finds \"c\"\\xa0=\\xa03, which uses up the final unit; this establishes formula_17, and the remaining values \"c\" will be the maximal ones with formula_18, namely . Thus we have found the 5-combination }.\\n\\nSection::::National Lottery example in Excel.\\nFor each of the formula_19 lottery combinations \"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0\"c\"\\xa0<\\xa0, there is a list number \"N\" between 0 and formula_20 which can be found by adding\\n\\nSuppose you want to find a position of a British National Lottery result 3,6,15,17,18,35 in a list of possible results. Excel function COMBIN(49,6) would show that number of results is 13983816. Now if you put numbers 3,6,15,17,18,35 each in its cell and formulas COMBIN(49-3,6), COMBIN(49-6,5), COMBIN(49-15,4), COMBIN(49-17,3), COMBIN(49-18,2), 49−35 under each of them. Use cell references instead of actual values, the actual values are provided for readability. You would get a row of numbers of 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14. Adding these would show particular position 10381232. Note that you do not need use formula COMBIN(49-35,1) to get 14. You can have it by subtraction 49-35 alone. Also the COMBIN function does not return 0 in case 49-X becomes less than 6. You\\'d need to use IF with ISNUMBER function to convert #NUM! into 0.\\n\\nNow the reverse engineering is a bit trickier. You could use 49 IF statements in one cell or use solver to find maximum argument for COMBIN result to be less or equal than position number. Instead let\\'s use a table of 6 by 49 and use MATCH function where resulting row number would be the argument and a ball number. If you make column headings from 6 to 1 (B1:G1) in descending order and row labels of 1 to 49 (A2:A50) in ascending order (vertically ascending in Excel means numbers growing from top to bottom). Then if you fill up the table with formula COMBIN($A2,B$1) starting from left top corner. $ signs will make sure that index values are always taken from heading row and label column. Replace #NUM! with zeros. You should get something like this:\\n\\nNow if you create a new row of six cells and fill them with formulas which would find the largest values in each column which are less than or equal to position number in question:\\nThe first cell with =INDEX(B2:B50,MATCH(10381232,B2:B50)), the rest of the cells with\\n\\nThis would present you with a row of values you have already seen 9366819,962598,46376,4960,465,14\\nNow in a next row first cell write =49-MATCH(10381232,B2:B50) and similarly\\n\\nAgain use the references to cells instead of actual values. You should be presented with original ball numbers of 3,6,15,17,18,35.\\n\\nNow you can generate a fresh Lottery number combination from single =randbetween(1,combin(49,6)) or you could look at the list position numbers of earlier results to see if there is a trend.\\n\\nSection::::Applications.\\nOne could use the combinatorial number system to list or traverse all \"k\"-combinations of a given finite set, but this is a very inefficient way to do that. Indeed, given some \"k\"-combination it is much easier to find the next combination in lexicographic ordering directly than to convert a number to a \"k\"-combination by the method indicated above. To find the next combination, find the smallest \"i\"\\xa0≥\\xa02 for which \"c\"\\xa0≥\\xa0\"c\"+2 (if there is no such \"i\", take \"i\" = \"k\"+1); then increase \"c\" by one and set all \"c\" with to their minimal value . If the \"k\"-combination is represented by its characteristic vector, that is as a binary value with \"k\" bits\\xa01, then the next such value can be computed without any loop using bitwise arithmetic: the following C++ function will advance x to that value or return false:\\n\\n// find next k-combination\\nbool next_combination(unsigned long& x) // assume x has form x\\'01^a10^b in binary\\n\\nThis is called Gosper\\'s hack;\\ncorresponding assembly code was described as item 175 in HAKMEM.\\n\\nOn the other hand the possibility to directly generate the \"k\"-combination at index \"N\" has useful applications. Notably, it allows generating a random \"k\"-combination of an \"n\"-element set using a random integer \"N\" with formula_22, simply by converting that number to the corresponding \"k\"-combination. If a computer program needs to maintain a table with information about every \"k\"-combination of a given finite set, the computation of the index \"N\" associated with a combination will allow the table to be accessed without searching.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Combinatorial number system', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1113115'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'XxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111313', 'text': 'Wellington, Illinois\\n\\nWellington is a village in Lovejoy Township, Iroquois County, Illinois, United States.

It governed the country from 1964 to 1991 under the socialist presidency of Kenneth Kaunda, and which was the sole legal party between 1973 and 1990.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nUNIP was founded in October 1959 by Mainza Chona as a successor of the Zambian African National Congress (ZANC), banned earlier that year. UNIP was initially led Chona as the ZANC leader, Kaunda, had been imprisoned. Kaunda later assumed power as leader of UNIP after he was released from prison in 1960.\\n\\nIn the general elections, UNIP won 14 seats, in second position, the first being taken by United Federal Party(UFP). Although Northern Rhodesian African National Congress leader Harry Nkumbula had made a secret electoral pact with the UFP, he later opted to form a government with UNIP. After a convincing victory in the Northern Rhodesian general elections in 1964, when UNIP won 55 of the 75 seats, Kaunda became Prime Minister of Northern Rhodesia, leading the country to independence on 24 October 1964, when he became President.\\n\\nIn the 1968 general elections Kaunda was re-elected president with 82% of the vote, and UNIP won 81 of the 105 elected seats in the National Assembly. \\n\\nIn 1973 the country became a one-party state with UNIP as the sole legal party, with an amended constitution being promulgated on 25 August 1973. The general election that year described as the final steps in achieving what was called a \"one-party participatory democracy.\" National policy was formulated by the Central Committee of UNIP. According to the constitution, UNIP\\'s president was selected at the party\\'s general conference, and the second-ranking person in the Zambian hierarchy was UNIP\\'s secretary general. The constitution also stipulated that UNIP\\'s president was the sole candidate for president of the republic; he was confirmed in office every five years via a yes/no referendum. Voters chose between multiple UNIP candidates for the 125 parliamentary seats, with three candidates running in each constituency. Kaunda was confirmed as president with 89% of the vote. Elections were held under the same system in 1978, 1983 and 1988, with Kaunda receiving at least 80% of the vote each time.\\n\\nAt the end of 1990 multi-party democracy was reintroduced, and UNIP was roundly defeated in the 1991 general elections by the Movement for Multi-Party Democracy (MMD); Kaunda was defeated in the presidential vote by MMD candidate Frederick Chiluba, receiving just 24% of the vote, whilst in the National Assembly elections UNIP won 25 seats to the MMD\\'s 125.\\n\\nFollowing changes to the constitution which effectively barred Kaunda from running for president again, UNIP boycotted the 1996 elections, although two members contested National Assembly seats. The party returned to contest the 2001 elections with Kenneth Kaunda\\'s son, Tilyenji, as its presidential candidate; he received 10% of the vote, finishing fourth out of the eleven candidates. In the National Assembly elections the party won 13 seats.\\n\\nPrior to the 2006 elections the party joined the United Democratic Alliance alongside the other two largest opposition parties. United Party for National Development leader Hakainde Hichilema was the alliance\\'s presidential candidate, finishing third.

Fernandez\\n\\nPando v. Fernandez, 127 Misc.2d 224 (N.Y. Sup. Ct. 1984), is a New York case that arose when Christopher Pando, a deeply religious minor, sought to impose a constructive trust on the proceeds of a winning $2.8 million (21 annual payments; no cash option) ticket that he purchased with Dasyi Fernandez\\'s money. Pando alleged that Mrs. Fernandez agreed to share the prize money equally with him if he prayed to a saint to cause the numbers he picked for her to be the winning numbers. At the time that Pando purchased the ticket, Mrs. Fernandez was 38 and the mother of three children on welfare. Christopher Pando was 16 (too young to buy lottery tickets) and was a friend of her son. Mrs. Fernandez denied that she ever asked Pando to buy the tickets or pick the numbers, and also denied the fact that she offered to share her money with him.\\n\\nSection::::Holding.\\nThe New York Supreme Court for New York County, the trial level court in New York, held that Pando had no legally enforceable claim on the proceeds of the winning lottery ticket since it would be impossible for him to prove in court that his faith and prayers brought about a miracle that caused the defendant to win. The court granted summary judgment for the defendants.\\n\\nSection::::Plaintiff\\'s Claims.\\nPando, through his father and guardian, John Pando, claimed a breach of a partnership agreement. In his complaint, Pando stated two causes of action. The first was that he entered into an oral partnership agreement with Mrs. Fernandez, who believed that Pando was deeply religious and a strong believer in St. Eleggua, and promised that if Pando took her $4 and bought a lottery ticket and selected the numbers, that they would share any of the prize money equally. One of the tickets he bought did in fact win the jackpot, and Pando claims that Mrs. Fernandez\\'s failure to give him 50% of the money constitutes a breach of contract. The second cause of action seeks a declaratory judgment as to the rights of the parties and an imposition of a constructive trust, along with an accounting of the money already paid out and received.\\n\\nSection::::Defendant\\'s Motion to Dismiss.\\nMrs. Fernandez moved to dismiss on three grounds. First she alleged that the oral agreement was barred by the Statute of Frauds, second that the agreement called upon Pando, a minor, to do an illegal act and is unenforceable, and third that it is impossible to prove in a court of law that the conditions precedent to the effectiveness of the contract had taken place.\\n\\nSection::::Court\\'s Reasoning.\\nStatute of Frauds\\n\\nAs to the defendant\\'s argument that the plaintiff\\'s claim was barred by the Statute of Frauds, the court held that the alleged agreement did not violate the Statute of Frauds, as it was able to be carried out within the one-year period for oral contracts mandated by statute in New York.\\n\\nIllegal Act\\n\\nIn addressing the defendant\\'s argument that the alleged agreement called upon Pando, who was under 18, to purchase the lottery ticket, it called for the performance of an illegal act so that enforcement of the contract by the courts would be against public policy, the court held that there was \"no pervasive requirement that the protection of public morals calls for denial of this contract.\" The court acknowledged that the law in the state of New York prohibits a person under 18 from purchasing a lottery ticket, but stated also that the law does not prohibit prizes from being paid to people under age 18.\\n\\nPlaintiff\\'s Ability to Prove Contract Conditions\\n\\nThe court then addressed the question of \"whether, in a court of law, plaintiff can prove compliance with the conditions of the contract, as he has set it forth.\" The court quoted the following statement from the plaintiff\\'s affidavit:\\n\\nMrs. Fernandez, knowing that I am religious and a strong believer in St. Eleggua asked me, after noticing that the Lotto prize was several million dollars, whether or not I could get my Saint to win the Lottery. I told her that I did not know, but I would try. She thereupon told me that she would give me $4.00 to select four different tickets and that if my St. Eleggua made my selection of the Lottery numbers win, she would go equal partners with me on the prize.\\n\\nThe court stated that the condition precedent for the sharing of the prize is that Pando\\'s \"piety and prayer would cause heavenly intervention so that his selections would win,\" and then asked the question \"[h]ow can plaintiff prove on a trial that \\'St. Eleggua made my selection of Lottery numbers win?\\'\" \\n\\nThe court noted that at trial Pando would have the ability to testify to his version of what the defendant said to him, that is that he purchased the tickets, selected the numbers and that he prayed. But the court rhetorically asked \"[w]ho is going to provide the proof that his prayers were efficacious, and that the saint caused the numbers to win?\" \\n\\nThe court looked into the identity of St. Eleggua and the closest it was able to come was a saint with the Latin name of St. Eligius, the patron saint of goldsmiths, who showered his riches on the poor, and possessed the gifts of miracles and prophecy. The plaintiff was only to share in the lottery winnings if his efforts and prayers to St. Eleggua caused Fernandez to win the money. In essence, the court said, Fernandez wanted a miracle from St. Eleggua arranged by the plaintiff, so the plaintiff has the burden of proving that his prayers caused the miracle to occur.\\n\\nThis presented the court with the problem of determining whether a miracle occurred. The court summarized its problem as follows:\\n\\nHow can we really know what happened? Is a court to engage in the epistemological inquiry as to the acquisition of knowledge and belief through proof or through faith? Faith is the antithesis of proof. It is a belief which is firmly held even though demonstrable proof may be lacking. It is instructive, spiritual, and profound, arrived at not through a coldly logical appraisal of the facts but, in Wordsworth\\'s phrase, by \\'a passionate institution.\\' \\n\\nThe court held that it was impossible to prove in a court of law, which requires tangible proof, that a litigant\\'s faith and prayers brought about a miracle. The court did not discount the fact that perhaps Pando\\'s prayers did bring about a miracle, just that it was impossible to prove in a \"modern courtroom.\"\\n\\nThe court noted that in the past, under Roman law and in Medieval law, there was acceptance of the demonstration of miracles in the courtroom, but distinguished that time from the present because the function of the secular and ecclesiastical courts was not separated in the past, and there was no distinction between \"the law of the earth\" and \"the law of heaven.\" The court stated that in the modern era \"the chasm between the temporal and the spiritual world has become unbridgeable. Theology is to be protected against the law, just as the law is to be protected from theology.\"\\n\\nTherefore, the court concludes, there is no way for the plaintiff to prove that his prayer caused Fernandez to have the winning ticket. He cannot prove the existence of saints, the power of prayer, nor divine intervention in temporal affairs.\\n\\nConstructive Trust\\n\\nFinally, the court addressed the plaintiff\\'s argument that a constructive trust be imposed. The court decides that because there is no close or confidential relationship between the parties that would call for the imposition of a trust, nor would defendant be unjustly enriched if she retained the full proceeds of her winning ticket that there is no basis for the imposition of a constructive trust.\\n\\nSection::::Appellate Court Decision.\\nIn Pando v. Fernandez, 118 A.D.2d 474 (N.Y. App. Div. 1986), the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division reversed the Supreme Court\\'s decision, denying defendant\\'s motion to dismiss and reinstating the complaint, as well as granting the plaintiff\\'s cross motion to direct defendant to comply with all previously ordered discovery within 30 days of the date of the order.\\n\\nSection::::Court\\'s Holding and Reasoning.\\nThe court disagreed with the lower court\\'s holding that there was a cause to dismiss the action for impossibility of proof. The court agreed that saintly intervention is not provable in a court of law, but said it is not evident that the alleged agreement between Pando and Fernandez required such intervention as a condition of enforceability. The court bases this holding on the fact that in at least three places in the record that the lower court did not cite the plaintiff describes the agreement in terms that do not impose a condition of saintly intervention for enforcement. The court says that these versions of the agreement show only that the plaintiff was obligated to use his best efforts to enlist St. Eleggua\\'s help, and that in exchange the defendant would pay for the tickets and split any potential winnings.\\n\\nThe court said that if the defendant bargained for the plaintiff\\'s assistance and she received that assistance, she cannot disown her obligations under the agreement by imposing the additional condition that Pando prove the effectiveness of his prayers. It was possible, according to the court, that the defendant bargained simply for the benefit of the plaintiff\\'s prayers which she felt would enhance her chances of winning the lottery. Therefore, the plaintiff was required to purchase the tickets, select the numbers and pray to the Saint to fulfill his end of the bargain. The court said that none of these actions are impossible to prove in a court of law.\\n\\nThe court concluded that the lower court erred in dismissing the complaint for impossibility of proof it decided the central factual issue of the case, which was what the parties agreed to.\\n\\nJury ultimately awarded 1/2 of $2.8 million prize to Pando finding that he had entered into a legally binding contract with Ms. Fernandez.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Pando v.

Pothan. It stars Kamal Haasan, Prabhu and Amala in lead roles and Sasikala and Kushboo in supporting roles. The film was a blockbuster and completed 175-day run at the box office. It is loosely based on the novel \"The Bourne Identity\" by Robert Ludlum.\\n\\nSection::::Summary.\\nA man (Kamal Haasan) is being chased by heavily armed men in a coastline. He takes out a couple of them with his superior skills, but is shot down from a hanging ladder in the helicopter trying to rescue him. He washes up on the shores of Goa unconscious and is rescued by Shirley (Sasikala), who brings him to her doctor aunt (Sowcar Janaki).\\n\\nWhen he wakes up, he realizes that he is suffering from amnesia and has a few flashes of sculptures and a karate class, but does not recognize them. Meanwhile, the local rowdy has been harassing the doctor and her niece. The man manages to thwart their next attack easily, which makes him believe that he might be trained in martial arts. Since the man has enraged the rowdy, the doctor pleads with him to marry her niece for her own protection. He does so and thwarts another attack from the rowdy during their wedding.\\n\\nRight after, he decides to leave for Madras to find his identity with his new wife in tow. Soon they find out that the earlier flashes he had are of the sculptures in Connemara Hotel and he used to be a regular there. After getting the bank account number he has used previously in the Hotel, he visits the bank and is once again surprised to find out that he was a regular to the bank too and has a locker with a large amount of money, multiple passports of him and a hand gun.\\n\\nWhile leaving the bank, he is attacked by an unknown assailant in the lift but he once again successfully maims the assailant and escapes, but leaves a shocked witness. His bank locker contents along with his martial arts skills make him believe that he might have been involved in gangs before and decides to surrender to police but is talked out it by his wife.\\n\\nVijay (Prabhu) and Jaya (Kushboo) are part of a wedding band. The man decides to uncover another one of his image flashes and tries to locate the karate class. In one such class, the instructor recognizes him, but guides him towards a singer Disco Shanti and tells him that he might be in danger. Another group of assailants attack him, and Vijay and Jaya are caught in the chaos. Believing Vijay to be helping the man, they kidnap Jaya and demand the surrender of the man, but Vijay and the man team up to rescue Jaya, which makes Vijay pledge to help the man in his quest.\\n\\nThe man then goes to talk to the singer, but is soon recognized and is shot at. The singer helps him escape and gives him a phone number to contact but is seriously wounded. He contacts the number and barely escapes another attempt on his life, but manages to meet the person who the singer referred to, which happens to be Nithyanandam, the Deputy Inspector General of Police.\\n\\nHe finally learns of his true identity. His name is Vetrivel, and he was a happily married to Lalitha (Amala Akkineni), and was undercover IPS officer who teamed up with the DIG to bring down a notorious hit man Zinda (Salim Ghouse). Unable to find any information about Zinda\\'s whereabouts, they devise a plan to make Vetri go undercover and make him a bigger and more dangerous hit man than Zinda, hoping Zinda would get in touch with his fiercest competitor. The plan works, and soon Zinda and Vetri become friends. But soon, Zinda learns about an undercover police officer in his gang through a spy and kidnap Lalitha to oust the spy. Vetri breaks his cover to protect Lalitha, but she is shot and killed in the shooting that ensues, and Vetri is chased (the opening in the movie), but escapes barely.\\n\\nVetri puts the pieces back together and uncovers a plot by Zinda to assassinate a very popular priest, Baba Appaji (Janagaraj) when he went to visit the singer. Vijay and Vetri thwart the plot, but Zinda still manages to escape. In order to avenge this Zinda kidnaps both Vijay\\'s and Vetri\\'s wives and sends them a photographic evidence of the kidnap. But Vetri and Vijay soon find the location with the background signboard in the photo, rescue their wives, and arrest Zinda.\\n\\nAwaiting Zinda\\'s presence in the courtroom for his trial, they are surprised to see an unknown man being presented in the trial as Zinda. This makes them think that the commissioner may be the spy who swapped Zinda out and rushes to his house to confront him, but finds him murdered in the arms of his crying wife. Suspicions still exist, and Vetri and Vijay find that the real spy is the commissioner\\'s wife, and they confront her. She shows them a lot of cash and asks them to let her go. Vijay sees this, and shoots and kills Vetri for the money, and asks the wife to give him the money and leave. Believing that Vetri is finally dead, she rushes back to Zinda. But Vetri is alive, and this was a plan to make her lead them to Zinda\\'s location. Vetri and Vijay follow her to a ship docked on the port, and go in to arrest Zinda. Zinda and his men are soon overpowered by the two-man fighting machine, but before he dies, he arms a bomb in the ship. Vetri and Vijay collaborate once and successfully disarm the bomb, thus relieving the port of the threat. The movie ends with both of them shaking hands.\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nThe film is Pratap Pothen\\'s fifth directorial and third in Kollywood after \"Meendum Oru Kaathal Kathai\" and \"Jeeva\" and was loosely inspired by the novel \"The Bourne Identity\", written by Robert Ludlum in 1980. Bollywood actor Salim Ghouse made his Tamil debut with this film, portraying the antagonist. Prabhu\\'s character was not present in the novel, and was created for the film. It was dubbed in Telugu as \"Vijethalu\" and released in 1989. Prabhu Deva working as dance assistant to his father Sundaram Master choreographed a song independently for \"Vetri Vizha\".\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Soundtrack.\\nThis music and background score was composed by Illayaraja.\\n\\nSection::::Re-release.\\nA digitally restored version of the film was released in August 4, 2017.\\n', 'title': 'Vetri Vizha', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11141646'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ahhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11145524', 'text': 'Lionheart: Tussle with the Beast\\n\\nLionheart: Tussle with the Beast is the second studio album from English rapper Klashnekoff, released in 2007 on Riddim Killa Records.

The book is a biographical novel about the life of Cedric Jennings through his last years in high school and first years in college. It details his life in Ballou High School, an inner city school in Washington, D.C., and onto Brown University, which Cedric attends after high school. The book portrays the problems of inner-city education systems and how the students from these systems are affected throughout their lives. In 2008, the book was selected as part of the \"One Maryland, One Book\" program.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nCedric Jennings is an anomaly at Ballou High School in the Southeast neighborhood of Washington, D.C.: in a \\npoorly performing school where academic achievement is scorned, Cedric proudly strives for high grades with \\na desire to attend a top university. The sub-par standards at Ballou place him at a distinct disadvantage \\nacademically, while frequent taunts and physical threats from other students have alienated him socially. Cedric \\nlives with his mother, Barbara Jennings, who works for the Department of Agriculture; his father Cedric Gilliam \\nis a drug dealer currently in jail. \\nIn his junior year, Cedric is admitted to the Minority Introduction to Engineering and Science (MITES) summer \\nprogram at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He believes this is the start of a new life for him, but \\nwhen summer arrives he finds the classes much more difficult than his fellow MITES students who attended \\nbetter schools and were better versed in math and science. Although he makes friends at MIT, he also sees that his \\nghetto background sets him apart from them. At the end of the program, Cedric is told by faculty director Leon \\nTrilling that he would not be welcome in MIT as a college student.\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nAt Ballou Senior High, a school besieged by violence in Washington, D.C., honor students have learned to keep their heads down. Like most inner-city kids, they know that any special attention in a place this dangerous can make you a target of violence. But Cedric Jennings will not swallow his pride, and with unwavering support from his mother, he studies and strives as if his life depends on it—and it does. The summer after his junior year, at a program for minorities at MIT, he gets a fleeting glimpse of life outside, a glimpse that turns into a face-on challenge one year later: acceptance into Brown University, an Ivy League school.\\nAt Brown, finding himself far behind most of the other freshmen, Cedric must manage a bewildering array of intellectual and social challenges. Cedric had hoped that at college he would finally find a place to fit in, but he discovers he has little in common with either the white students, many of whom come from privileged backgrounds, or the middle-class blacks. Having traveled too far to turn back, Cedric is left to rely on his faith, his intelligence, and his determination to keep alive his hope in the unseen—a future of acceptance and reward that he struggles, each day, to envision.\\n\\nSection::::Critical Response and Reaction.\\nThe book was met with overwhelming critical and commercial success. It was chosen by the New York Times, Chicago Tribune, Washington Monthly and Booklist as one of the best books of the year. The New York Times Book Review called it “An extraordinary, formula-shattering book”. David Halberstam called it \"A beautiful book of a heroic American struggle.\" The book has been a regular selection in college courses on American culture, education, sociology and creative writing, and has been a required reading for incoming freshmen at many Universities. In 2008, the book was selected as part of the “One Maryland, One Book” program.\\n\\nThe book was especially noted for its influence on the debate over affirmative action. Upon its release in 1998, affirmative action had become one of the preeminent domestic social issues facing the country. In their review of the book, CNN declared \"As more voters, politicos and talk-show hosts write off affirmative action as a well-intentioned anachronism, \"A Hope in the Unseen\" should be required reading for would-be opinion-mongers.\" In his review for Newsday, Bill Reel stated \"I changed my thinking about affirmative action. I was against it, now I am for it. The agent of change was a mind-opening book - \"A Hope in the Unseen\" by Ron Suskind.\"\\n\\nThe book also drew high praise for its innovations to writing style - using exhaustive reporting to place readers inside the heads of characters. The Chicago Tribune called the book, \"the new, new nonfiction. \"\\n\\nOn March 25, 2009 \"All Things Considered\" ran a segment about A Hope in the Unseen on NPR. During the segment, Susan Jane Gilman, the author of \"Undress Me in the Temple of Heaven\", described her affinity for Suskind\\'s work. \"Suskind\\'s literary talent is double barreled. He\\'s a Pulitzer Prize–winning journalist who lived with the Jennings at close range for several years.

It is 8\\xa0miles north of Liverpool city centre and is located on the coast near the boundary of the Mersey Estuary and Liverpool Bay. The River Alt joins the sea at this point and forms an estuary. There is a pumping station on the River Alt at Altmouth, built 1972, as part of a programme to alleviate flooding in the area. This is on the Altcar Rifle Range, a Territorial Army base originally established in 1860 by Lt. Col. Gladstone.\\n\\nThe village is featured in \\'Lancashire Life\\' magazine, May 2004 \\'Tales of the sea at Hightown, near Southport\\' pp.\\xa0150–154\\nby Harold Brough, photographs by John Cocks.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nA dictionary of English Place-Names, A. D. Mills (OUP, Oxford, 1991) lists only a Hightown as a part of Congleton in Cheshire (there is also part of Banbury in Oxfordshire called Hightown). However specific books on Lancashire place names do list this Hightown in what was formerly Lancashire. Altmouth as a settlement features on many old maps prior to the 18th Century, north of where the village is now, bordering Altcar parish. Alt Grange is recorded as 13th Century. David Mills in his book \"The place-names of Lancashire\" does give High Town dated 1702. However he gives no source or reference. Understandably Mills appears to have not visited the small West Lancashire coastal village or he would not have given the description \"the major town .. The name appears to be modern and self-explanatory\". The first recorded mention of the place name Hightown is in Nicholas Blundell\\'s Diaries. Nicholas Blundell\\'s Diaries, Vol. 3 1720 (published 1972) refers to visiting High-Town Greene on the 18 May 1722 (p.\\xa077). There is still a village green today (oddly triangular) near the pub and railway station but unlike when Nicholas Blundell visited there are no cattle pens on it. However the earliest record of the place is probably in a probate record for Richard Riding of Moorhouses in Little Crosby husbandman from 1715. Moorhouses was a hamlet on the shore where Hightown is today, it is remembered in the name of one of the modern closes. The inventory for Richard Riding\\'s property records it as being of the property of “Richard Rydeing of the Hytown within Crosbie Parava.” High Town is recorded on Greenwood\\'s Map of Lancashire, 1818, north east of where the village is today, approximately at the junction of Orrell Hill Lane with the modern A565\\n\\nHightown is historically part of the estate of the Blundell family of Little Crosby and many houses still pay a nominal ground rent annually to the Whitlock-Blundell estate. Hightown beach is the site of a former wartime military base known as Fort Crosby. The fort was situated midway between Hightown and Hall Road and housed a number of Italian and German POW\\'s during WWII. Following its decommission at the end of the war a small cinema screen within the complex was reputedly used by local residents for a number of years until the camp was finally demolished in the mid-1960s. Remains of many of the buildings, pathways and fences can still be seen today.\\n\\nDuring the early part of the 20th century the village formed its own voluntary fire service following a number of deaths and injuries resulting from the excessive time taken for the Crosby Fire Service to reach the village. The most notable of these incidents was the loss of a family during a blaze within the lighthouse which once stood close to the site of Fort Crosby. The lighthouse was built in 1839. The most prominent buildings at the turn of the 20th Century were the Truant School, next to the railway line, and the Hightown Hotel (the village pub). In 1901 “There were 20 officials and 114 boys in the truant school at Hightown, belonging to the Liverpool education authority.”\\n\\nListed buildings and Second World War remains. heritagegateway.org.uk (a partnership project of English Heritage) lists Hightown Cross and three listed buildings in Hightown: the Cross itself, Whitedge Farmhouse (Alt Road) and Rose Cottage. In the immediate vicinity Moss Farmhouse, North End Lane, is also listed. Three World War Two invasion defence pillboxes can be seen near Gorsey Lane and are listed in the database, each as: Type 23 World War II concrete pillbox, constructed in the period 1940 to 1941. These are found in the Defence of Britain Archive of the Council for British Archaeology, 2002.\\n\\nListed as in poor condition (surveyed in 2000) is Coastal Battery S0011771 (Crosby Point Battery), between Coastguard Station and Hightown, north of Crosby. This is near the end of the West Lancs Golf Course, a mile south from Hightown station just off the footpath from Hall Road to Hightown. When Sefton Council upgraded the Sefton Coastal Footpath they blocked up two gun emplacements that remained of the Fort Crosby site. A former resident alleged in 2011 that Sefton Council had deliberately neglected the World War II heritage at Hightown, but there is no evidence of deliberate neglect. An exhibition by artist Tom Fairclough \\'Collateral\\' contained peaceful but evocative pictures of the rubble that make up the sea defences at the mouth of the Alt. Fairclough documented how the rubble was the remains of houses from the destruction in Bootle in the blitz of May 1941.\\n\\nThe most authoritative local history reference on Hightown, Merseyside is:\\n\"My Hightown 1897 - 1969\" by Joe Bulman. 1st ed. 1975. The 3rd ed. revised and enlarged by Andrew Lee-Hart and\\nMatthew Tinker published by Sefton Libraries Corporation, Southport, 2003. This edition of the book contains 40 photographs, 2 maps & 8 appendices including personal stories of men listed on the Hightown War Memorial (Appendix 3 by Hal Giblin), and history of The Truant School (Appendix 7 by Andrew Lee-Hart).\\n\\nSection::::Transport.\\nThe village is served by Hightown railway station, on the Northern Line of the Merseyrail network. Services run to Southport and to Hunts Cross via Liverpool city centre. The Liverpool, Crosby and Southport Railway opened in 1848 (from Southport to Waterloo initially). It was absorbed in the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway Company, 1850. There is also a local bus service that runs to Hall Road, located in nearby Crosby.\\n\\nSection::::Sport.\\nThe Blundellsands Sailing Club celebrated its centenary in 2007. The clubhouse is located on the foreshore and the post code is L38 0BU. On the beach, approximately 50\\xa0metres from the Sailing club are the remains of a three- to four-thousand-year-old forest.\\n\\nHightown also has its own sports club, the Hightown Club, which also celebrated its centenary in 2007. A brief history was written at this time and featured on the Club\\'s cricket website and in local media.\\n\\nToday the Hightown Club offers sporting and social facilities for lawn bowls, cricket, squash, tennis and junior football \\n, although in the past there have been highly successful hockey and rugby sections. The rugby section sadly folded in 2000 and men\\'s hockey merged with Northern in the mid-1980s.\\nThe Hightown ladies hockey team were one of the country\\'s most prominent clubs in the 1980s and 90s, when they were led by England international Maggie Souyave. Since then they have played in several locations outside the village before eventually settling at Cheshire club Bowdon.\\n\\nCricket is most prominent sport played at the club, with the 1st XI currently playing in the Premier League of the Liverpool and District Cricket Competition. The captain for the 2012 season will be Shaun Vosloo, who replaced Ian Sutcliffe following the latter\\'s 11-year reign as skipper.\\n\\nOn 16 January 2011 the Club was completely destroyed by a large fire due to an electrical fault near the function suite.\\nSince the fire, all the sporting sections have been using temporary facilities and the club is planning a complete rebuild of the clubhouse, with work to commence in 2012.\\n\\nSection::::Governance.\\nFrom 1950 until 2010 Hightown was within the boundaries of the Crosby constituency, whose MP from 1997 until 2010 was Claire Curtis-Thomas, a member of the Labour Party. Prior to her election the Crosby seat was generally considered to be a safe Conservative Party stronghold with Tory MPs elected at every election barring the Crosby by-election, 1981 where Shirley Williams of the Social Democratic Party was elected to represent the constituency. As a result of boundary revisions for the 2010 general election the Crosby constituency was abolished with its northern parts, including Hightown, being merged with the Eastern parts of Sefton that were formerly part of the Knowsley North and Sefton East constituency, to form the new constituency of Sefton Central, which is currently represented by the Labour Party MP Bill Esterson.\\n\\nFor elections to Sefton Council the village and Civil parish of Hightown is within the Manor electoral ward and is represented by three councillors. The councillors of Manor ward are Martyn Barber of the Conservative Party, John Gibson of the Liberal Democrats, and Steve McGinnity of the Labour Party.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Hightown, Merseyside', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1115715'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'bxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11157284', 'text': \"Student Connections\\n\\nStudent Connections (SC) is a federally sponsored, Canada-wide initiative that provides E-business and Internet training services to small- and medium-sized businesses as well as senior citizens.\\n\\nFounded in 1996, the program is funded by Industry Canada and the Canadian government's Youth Employment Strategy and operates out of colleges and universities across the country, giving post-secondary students practical experience working with private-sector businesses to develop effective E-commerce strategies.\\n\\nThere are currently 17 centres in operation across Canada.\\n\\n\", 'title': 'Student Connections', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11157284'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'cBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11159097', 'text': 'Delta G Scientific Company\\n\\nDelta G Scientific Company was originally a front company established April 1982 in Weldegraan by the South African Defence Force to research and produce chemical weapons within a covert operation known as Project Coast.\\n\\nMedchem Consolidated Investments was registered in the Cayman Islands by a David Webster on behalf of Wouter Basson, who held 75% of Delta G shares.\\n\\nDelta G was acquired in 1993 by Sentrachem, which is since 1997 a subsidiary of the Dow Chemical Company.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Delta G Scientific Company', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11159097'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'cRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111623', 'text': 'Sparland, Illinois\\n\\nSparland is a village in Marshall County, Illinois, United States.

Popular performers included Bohdan Smoleń (joined in 1977), Jadwiga Żywczak Marian Pogasz, Rudi Schuberth Janusz Rewiński, Grażyna Łobaszewska, Zbigniew Górny, Zbigniew Wodecki and Małgorzata Ostrowska, with music written by Włodzimierz Korcz (author of \"Żeby Polska była Polską\", the informal anthem of \"Solidarity\"). The most popular of these were Laskowik and Smoleń, who often performed as a team.\\n\\nThe cabaret style relied heavily on improvisation. Its first significant award was the satirical \"Szpilki\" magazine\\'s \"Złota Szpilka\" (the Golden Pin) award at the National Festival of Polish Song in Opole in 1973; this award also did much to popularize the cabaret. From 1977 the group worked with Polish national television (Telewizja Polska). As the communist system of the People\\'s Republic of Poland began to wind down, so did Kabaret TEY, whose career was very much built on parodying the existing political system and communist reality. The group had another successful performance in Opole in 1980, and toured both Poland and some other countries. In 1984 it changed its name to TEYATR. Its last performance in Poland took place in 1987 and the last performance for Polonia (Polish diaspora in the United States and Canada) took place in 1988.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nKabaret TEY was one of the most popular Polish cabarets in the 1970s and 1980s. Its fame was such that in the mid-1980s, it became one of the main icons associated with Poznań, and some of the jokes and phrases coined in it have entered the Polish language and culture.\\n\\nThe group texts became more political in the aftermath of the rise of Solidarity and introduction of the martial law in Poland in 1981.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Kabaret TEY', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11163527'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1116391', 'text': 'Mikhail Volkenshtein\\n\\nMikhail Vladimirovich Volkenshtein (October 23, 1912 – February 18, 1992) was a notable Russian biophysicist, Corresponding Member of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor and Doktor nauk.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nHe was Head of the Department of the Institute of Molecular Biology of the Russian Academy of Sciences, Professor of the Moscow State University, member of the Editorial Board of the Journal \"\"Molekuliarnaya Biologia\"\" of the Russian Academy of Sciences, winner of the State Prize of the former Soviet Union. \\n\\nVolkenshtein created the Leningrad school of polymer science in the early 1950.

Political freedom was described as freedom from oppression or coercion, the absence of disabling conditions for an individual and the fulfillment of enabling conditions, or the absence of life conditions of compulsion, e.g. economic compulsion, in a society. Although political freedom is often interpreted negatively as the freedom from unreasonable external constraints on action, it can also refer to the positive exercise of rights, capacities and possibilities for action and the exercise of social or group rights. The concept can also include freedom from internal constraints on political action or speech (e.g. social conformity, consistency, or inauthentic behaviour). The concept of political freedom is closely connected with the concepts of civil liberties and human rights, which in democratic societies are usually afforded legal protection from the state.\\n\\nSection::::Views.\\nVarious groups along the political spectrum naturally differ on what they believe constitutes true political freedom.\\n\\nLeft-wing political philosophy generally couples the notion of freedom with that of positive liberty, or the enabling of a group or individual to determine their own life or realize their own potential. In this sense, freedom may include freedom from poverty, starvation, treatable disease and oppression as well as freedom from force and coercion, from whomever they may issue.\\n\\nClassical liberal Friedrich Hayek criticized this as a misconception of freedom: [T]he use of \"liberty\" to describe the physical \"ability to do what I want\", the power to satisfy our wishes, or the extent of the choice of alternatives open to us [...] has been deliberately fostered as part of the socialist argument[.] [T]he notion of collective power over circumstances has been substituted for that of individual liberty.\\n\\nAnarcho-socialists see negative and positive liberty as complementary concepts of freedom. Such a view of rights may require utilitarian trade-offs, such as sacrificing the right to the product of one\\'s labor or freedom of association for less racial discrimination or more subsidies for housing. Social anarchists describe the negative liberty-centric view endorsed by capitalism as \"selfish freedom\".\\n\\nAnarcho-capitalists see negative rights as a consistent system. Ayn Rand described it as \"a moral principle defining and sanctioning a man’s freedom of action in a social context\". To such libertarians, positive liberty is contradictory since so-called rights must be traded off against each other, debasing legitimate rights which by definition trump other moral considerations. Any alleged right which calls for an end result (e.g. housing, education, medical services and so on) produced by people is in effect a purported right to enslave others.\\n\\nSome notable philosophers, such as Alasdair MacIntyre, have theorized freedom in terms of our social interdependence with other people.\\n\\nIn his book \"Capitalism and Freedom\", American economist Milton Friedman argues that there are two types of freedom, namely political freedom and economic freedom. Friedman asserted that without economic freedom there cannot be political freedom. This idea was contested by Robin Hahnel in his article \"Why the Market Subverts Democracy\". Hahnel points out a set of issues with Friedman’s understanding of economic freedom, i.e. that there will in fact be infringements on the freedom of others whenever anyone exercises their own economic freedom and that such infringements can only be avoided if there is a precisely defined property rights system—which Friedman fails to provide or specify directly. \\n\\nAccording to political philosopher Nikolas Kompridis, the pursuit of freedom in the modern era can be broadly divided into two motivating ideals, namely freedom as autonomy or independence and freedom as the ability to cooperatively initiate a new beginning.\\n\\nPolitical freedom has also been theorized in its opposition to and a condition of power relations, or the power of action upon actions, by Michel Foucault. It has also been closely identified with certain kinds of artistic and cultural practice by Cornelius Castoriadis, Antonio Gramsci, Herbert Marcuse, Jacques Rancière and Theodor Adorno.\\n\\nEnvironmentalists often argue that political freedoms should include some constraint on use of ecosystems. They maintain there is no such thing, for instance, as freedom to pollute or freedom to deforest given that such activities create negative externalities, which violates other groups\\' liberty to not be exposed to pollution. The popularity of SUVs, golf and urban sprawl has been used as evidence that some ideas of freedom and ecological conservation can clash. This leads at times to serious confrontations and clashes of values reflected in advertising campaigns, e.g. that of PETA regarding fur.\\n\\nJohn Dalberg-Acton stated: \"The most certain test by which we judge whether a country is really free is the amount of security enjoyed by minorities\".\\n\\nGerald C. MacCallum Jr. spoke of a compromise between positive and negative freedoms, saying that an agent must have full autonomy over themselves. It is triadic in relation to each other because it is about three things, namely the agent, the constraints they need to be free from and the goal they are aspiring to.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nHannah Arendt traces freedom\\'s conceptual origins to ancient Greek politics. According to her study, the concept of freedom was historically inseparable from political action. Politics could only be practiced by those who had freed themselves from the necessities of life so that they could participate in the realm of political affairs. According to Arendt, the concept of freedom became associated with the Christian notion of freedom of the will, or inner freedom, around the 5th century CE and since then freedom as a form of political action has been neglected even though, as she says, freedom is \"the raison d\\'être of politics\".\\n\\nArendt says that political freedom is historically opposed to sovereignty or will-power since in ancient Greece and Rome the concept of freedom was inseparable from performance and did not arise as a conflict between the will and the self. Similarly, the idea of freedom as freedom from politics is a notion that developed in modern times. This is opposed to the idea of freedom as the capacity to \"begin anew\", which Arendt sees as a corollary to the innate human condition of natality, or our nature as \"new beginnings and hence beginners\".\\n\\nIn Arendt\\'s view, political action is an interruption of automatic process, either natural or historical. The freedom to begin anew is thus an extension of \"the freedom to call something into being which did not exist before, which was not given, not even as an object of cognition or imagination, and which therefore, strictly speaking, could not be known\".\\n\\n', 'title': 'Political freedom', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11175', 'cat_id': '11175', 'cat_title': '1756_in_Ireland', 'cat_pages': '2', 'cat_subcats': '1', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ghhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11179029', 'text': 'Hanover Heights Neighborhood Historic District\\n\\nThe Hanover Heights Historic District area was developed between 1912 and 1930.

Evidence suggests they are an effective material as they are biocompatible, aesthetic, insoluble and have a hardness of 7 on the Mohs scale. For certain dental prostheses, such as three-unit molars porcelain fused to metal or in complete porcelain group, zirconia-based restorations are recommended.\\n\\nThe word \"ceramic\" is derived from the Greek word \"keramos\", meaning \"potter\\'s clay\". It came from the ancient art of fabricating pottery where mostly clay was fired to form a hard, brittle object; a more modern definition is a material that contains metallic and non-metallic elements (usually oxygen). These materials can be defined by their inherent properties including their hard, stiff, and brittle nature due to the structure of their inter-atomic bonding, which is both ionic and covalent. In contrast, metals are non-brittle (display elastic behavior), and ductile (display plastic behaviour) due to the nature of their inter-atomic metallic bond. These bonds are defined by a cloud of shared electrons with the ability to move easily when energy is applied. Ceramics can vary in opacity from very translucent to very opaque. In general, the more glassy the microstructure (i.e. noncrystalline) the more translucent it will appear, and the more crystalline, the more opaque.\\n\\nSection::::Composition.\\nCeramic used in dental application differs in composition from conventional ceramic to achieve optimum aesthetic components such as translucency. Their composition is as follows:\\n\\nSection::::Classification.\\nCeramics can be classified based on the following:\\nSection::::Classification by Microstructure.\\nAt the microstructural level, ceramics can be defined by the nature of their composition of amorphous-to-crystalline ratio. There can be an infinite variability of the microstructures of materials, but they can be broken down into four basic compositional categories, with a few subgroups:\\n\\nDental ceramic is generally regarded as biologically inert. However, other toxicities may exist from depleted uranium as well as some of the other accessory materials; in addition, the restoration may increase wear on opposing teeth.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Types of Ceramics.\\nThe range of dental ceramics determined by their respective firing temperatures are:\\nFired below 850\\xa0°C - mainly used for shoulder ceramics (aims to combat the problem of shrinkage, specifically at the margins of the prep, when the early sintered ceramic state is fired to produce the final restoration), to correct minor defects and to add colour/shading to restorations\\nFired between 850 and 1100\\xa0°C - to prevent the occurrence of distortion, this type of ceramic should not be subjected to multiple firings\\nThis type is used mainly for denture teeth\\n\\nSection::::Laboratory Procedure.\\nThe dentist will usually specify a shade or combination of shades for different parts of the restoration, which in turn corresponds to a set of samples containing the porcelain powder. There are two types of porcelain restorations: \\n\\nCeramic restorations can be built on a refractory die, which is a reproduction of a prepared tooth made of a strong material with the ability to withstand high temperatures, or it can be constructed on a metal coping or core.\\n\\nFor ceramic fused to metal restorations, the black color of metal is first masked with an opaque layer giving it a shade of white before consecutive layers are built up. The powder corresponding to the desired shade of dentine base is mixed with water before it is fired. Further layers are built up to mimic the natural translucency of the enamel of the tooth. The porcelain is fused to a semi-precious metal or precious metal, such as gold, for extra strength.\\n\\nSystems which use an aluminium oxide, zirconium oxide or zirconia core instead of metal, produces complete porcelain restorations.\\n\\nSection::::Firing.\\nOnce the mass has been built up, it is fired to allow fusion of the ceramic particles which in turn forms the completed restoration; the process by which this is done is referred to as ‘baking’.\\n\\nThe first bake forces water out and allows the particles to coalesce. During this initial process, a large amount of shrinkage occurs until the mass reaches an almost void-free state; to overcome this the mass is built-up to a size larger than the final restoration will be.\\n\\nThe mass is then left to cool slowly to prevent cracking and reduced strength of the final restoration.\\n\\nAdding more layers to build up the restoration to the desired shape and/or size requires the ceramic to undergo further rounds of firing.\\n\\nSection::::Staining.\\nCeramic can also be stained to show tooth morphology such as occlusal fissures and hypoplastic spots. These stains can be incorporated within the ceramic or applied onto the surface.\\n\\nSection::::Glazing.\\nGlazing is required to produce a smooth surface and it\\'s the last stage of sealing the surface as it will fill porous areas and prevent wear on opposing teeth. Glazing can be achieved by re-firing the restoration, which fuses outer layers of the ceramic, or by using glazes with lower fusing temperatures; these are applied on the outer surface of the restoration in a thin layer. Any adjustments are then made with polishing rubbers and fine diamonds.\\n\\nSection::::Use of CAD-CAM.\\nRecent developments in CAD/CAM dentistry uses special partially sintered ceramic (zirconia), glass-bonded ceramic or glass-ceramic (lithium disilicate) formed into machinable blocks, which are fired again after machining.\\n\\nBy utilising in-office CAD/CAM technology, clinicians are able to design, fabricate and place all-ceramic inlays, onlays, crowns and veneers in a single patient visit. Ceramic restorations produced by this method have demonstrated excellent fit, strength and longevity. Two basic techniques can be used for CAD/CAM restorations:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Indications for Ceramic Restorations.\\nCeramic restorations are indicated for most dental applications including:\\nHowever, each system will have its own set of specific indications and contraindications which can be obtained from the manufacturers guideline.\\n\\nSection::::Contraindications for Ceramic Restorations.\\nCeramic restorations are contraindicated when a patient presents with the following: \\n\\nSection::::Other uses.\\nSection::::Denture Teeth.\\nPoly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) is the material of choice for denture teeth, however ceramic denture teeth have been, and still are used for this purpose. The main benefit associated with the use of ceramic teeth is their superior wear resistance. There are however a number of disadvantages to using ceramic for denture teeth including their inability to form chemical bonds with the PMMA denture base; rather, ceramic teeth are attached to the base via mechanical retention which increases the chance of debonding during use over time. Additionally, they are more likely to fracture due to their brittle nature.\\n\\nSection::::Endodontic Posts.\\nCeramic can be used in the construction of non-metallic posts, however, it is a brittle material and as such may fracture within the root canal or may cause fracture of the root due to its increased strength. Another disadvantage is that once placed, removal may not be possible.\\n', 'title': 'Dental porcelain', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1117992'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11180699', 'text': 'Yūsei Oda\\n\\n, is a Japanese voice actor from Sendai, Miyagi Prefecture, Japan.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Yūsei Oda', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11180699'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '111866', 'text': 'Auburn, Illinois\\n\\nAuburn is a city in Sangamon County, Illinois, United States.

He was a member of the American Institute of Architects.\\n\\nSection::::Family and early life.\\nHopkins was born in Saratoga Springs, New York. His parents were Alfred Hopkins (1836-1884), a captain in the United States Navy, and Mary Elizabeth Penfield (1837-1898). They soon moved to Ohio where his parents gave birth to his brother Walter (b. 1879). Hopkins married Adelaide Spenlove (1894-1865) on June 30, 1915 in London, England. Following their marriage, Hopkins and his bride settled in New York City and had two sons—Alfred Spenlove Hopkins (1916-1995) and Peter Harrel Theodore Hopkins (1918-2004).\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nHopkins studied at the Ecole des Beaux Arts in Paris followed by several years in Rome completing his knowledge architecture, presumably in the early 1890s. By 1898, he returned to New York City and was practicing as an architect.\\n\\nEarly in his career, Hopkins specialized in the design of farming complexes for the American capitalist during the Gilded Age. By 1900, he was designing a new farm group for Frederick W. Vanderbilt in Hyde Park, New York in association with Edward Burnett (1849-1925), an agricultural specialist who earlier developed and managed the farming operations for other members of the Vanderbilt family. Hopkins and Burnett maintained an office at 11 East 24th Street in New York City. Together they designed some of the country\\'s most extraordinary farms, including Foxhollow, the Tracy Dows estate in Rhinebeck, New York, and a farm for Harry J. Fisher in Greenwich, Connecticut. Their collaboration, though not firmly documented during this time, probably resulted in several other farm projects associated with Hopkins New York, New Jersey, and Massachusetts. Their work, particularly Hopkins architectural style, established the standard for farm architecture and influenced an entire generation of architects.\\n\\nIn 1913, he severed his association with Burnett and established himself as Alfred Hopkins & Associates located in the Architects Building at 101 Park Avenue in New York City. Hopkins continued specializing in gentlemen\\'s farms, quickly establishing himself as the \"dean of farm group architecture,\" due in no small part to the success of his \"Modern Farm Buildings,\" first published in 1913 (dedicated to Edward Burnett) and two subsequent editions (with the Burnett dedication omitted). Hopkins farm groups appeared in Westchester County, New York, the Hudson River Valley, northern New Jersey, Illinois. He designed no fewer than fifteen farm groups on Long Island, including the farm at Laurelton Hall for Louis Comfort Tiffany. An article on farm groupings published in \"Architectural Record\" in 1915 notes that Hopkins was often called upon to design the farm groups on estates where the residences were the work of other architects, such as Bertram Goodhue, John Russell Pope and Charles A. Platt.\\n\\nHopkins was among the contributors to \"Stables and Farm Buildings: A Special Number of the Architectural Review\" produced by the staff of \"Architectural Review\" in 1902. His \"Modern Farm Buildings\" served to publicize his practical and picturesque esthetic, and in common with all architects\\' publications since the sixteenth century, to attract clients. Hopkins\\' book went into a third edition.\\n\\nHopkins laid out his farm buildings around paved courts or grassed paddocks, keeping rooflines and eaves low to blend with the landscape, and carefully separating the necessary farming functions. He preferred to remove hay storage from its traditional loft over the stables to eliminate dust infiltration and ammonia pollution. Open-sided sheds housed farm vehicles. The spatial routes of cows and horses were kept separate. Farmhands\\' quarters were integrated with the buildings. An outstanding late survival of Hopkins\\' Cotswolds-inspired vernacular manner is the stable court at Hartwood, near Pittsburgh (1929). The same year he published a brochure distributed among architects, \"Two Cotswolds Villages\", describing the vernacular architecture and stone-tiled roofs of two picturesque English villages: Bibury, Gloucestershire and Castle Combe, Wiltshire.\\n\\nHopkins is less known for his \"Prisons and Prison Building\" (New York: Architectural Book Publishing 1930), where rational planning met other ends, in a progressive and humane program based on the classification of prisoners and their segregation by groups in small units; proposals that argued against walled prisons and for the uplifting effect of good architecture. His practical experience was founded on his work at Westchester County Penitentiary, Berks County Prison, and his proposed designs for a federal prison to be built at Lewisburg, Pennsylvania, Lewisburg Federal Penitentiary, completed in 1934.\\n\\nHopkins was also among the architects who published plans for inexpensive carpenter-built housing in \"Carpentry and Building\". and his small book \"Planning for sunshine and fresh air: Being sundry discourses & excursions in the pleasant art of building homes, set forth in a manner and upon a theory ... how best to effect their proper economies\" appeared in 1931.\\n\\nHe also published \"The Fundamentals of Good Bank Building\" (1929).\\n\\nAfter an interim following his death, an architectural firm was founded in 1954 by six associates from his office, as La Pierre, Litchfield & Partners.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Alfred Hopkins', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11201583'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'jhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11204257', 'text': 'Live in California 74\\n\\nLive in California 74 is a live DVD of the first California Jam concert performance from Deep Purple released in 2005.

Blackmore felt this would dull the effect of the band\\'s light show. After ABC brought in a sheriff to arrest him, Blackmore agreed to perform. At the culmination of the performance, he destroyed several of his guitars and threw one of his amplifier stacks off the edge of the stage. He also struck one of the ABC cameras five times with a guitar and, in recorded footage, can be seen arranging for his road crew to set off a pyrotechnic device in one of his amplifiers, creating a large fireball that was quickly extinguished.

This place is often used in legal documents, together with name and date of birth, to uniquely identify a person. As a general rule with respect to passports, the place of birth is determined to be country that currently has \"sovereignty\" over the actual place of birth regardless of when the birth actually occurred. The place of birth is not necessarily the place where the parents of the new baby live. If the baby is born in a hospital in another place, that place is the place of birth. In many countries, this also means that the government requires that the birth of the new baby is registered in the place of birth.\\n\\nIn other countries, such as Sweden since 1947, there is a concept of \"födelsehemort\" (\"domicile of birth\"), which means that the domicile of the baby\\'s mother is the registered place of birth. The location of the maternity ward or other physical birthplace is considered unimportant.\\n\\nSometimes the place of birth automatically determines the nationality of the baby, a practice often referred to with the Latin phrase \"jus soli\" (it depends on the law of the country to give the nationality). More often, this may also depend on the nationality or nationalities of the parents (referred to as \"jus sanguinis\"). \\n\\nThere can be some confusion on the place of birth if the birth takes place in an unusual way: when babies are born in an airplane or at sea, difficulties can arise. The place of birth of such a person depends on the law of the countries involved, which include the nationality of the plane or ship, the nationality/nationalities of the parents and/or the position of the plane or ship (if the birth occurs in the territorial waters or airspace of a country).\\n\\nSome applications may request the \"Country of Birth\" of the applicant. It is important to determine from the requester whether the information requested refers to the \"Place of Birth\" or \"Nationality at Birth\" of the applicant.

She was the first ship named for Seaman Daniel Hogan.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" was launched by Union Iron Works, San Francisco, California, 12 April 1919; sponsored by Mrs. Magnus A. Anderson, a sister of the Secretary of the Interior Franklin K. Lane and commissioned 1 October 1919, Lieutenant Commander E.\\xa0M. Williams in command.\\n\\nSection::::Service history.\\nAfter shakedown, \"Hogan\" arrived at San Diego on 21 November to join the Pacific Destroyer Force. From 23 November to 6 February 1920 she sailed in company with her division and engaged in fleet maneuvers, patrol duty, torpedo exercises and target practice along the California coast. On 25 March she departed for Hawaii, where she operated for the next month. The destroyer rejoined her squadron at San\\xa0Diego in late April for five months of gunnery exercises and trial runs in that area. She returned to San\\xa0Diego in early 1921 and engaged in important experimental torpedo practice and divisional operations until 9 December. During that time, in October, \"Hogan\" became the first US Navy ship to be refuelled while underway, towed astern by the oiler . For the remainder of her service \"Hogan\" assisted U.S. battleships in conducting torpedo firing exercises in the Pacific. She decommissioned at San Diego on 27 May 1922.\\n\\nRecommissioned 7 August 1940, \"Hogan\" underwent conversion to a high speed minesweeper at Mare Island and reclassified DMS-6. Her activity up to World War II consisted mainly of intensified minesweeper training and patrol duty in the Caribbean and along the Eastern Coast,\\n\\nSection::::World War II.\\nDuring the early months of the war, \"Hogan\" acted as a convoy escort in the Caribbean and eastern Atlantic, protecting shipping from U-boat attack. The first major operation in which she took part was the invasion of North Africa in late 1942. For this important amphibious assault, mounted over an entire ocean, \"Hogan\" departed Norfolk 24 October and arrived with the Center Force off Fedhala for preliminary sweeps 7 November. As the landings began early next day, the minesweeper continued to patrol the vital transport area. Just after 05:00, she was sent to investigate strange running lights and came upon a French steamer and escort vessel. \"Hogan\" ordered both ships to reverse course, and when the order was not obeyed fired a burst of machine gun fire across the escort\\'s bow. The ship, \"Victoria\", replied with fire of her own and attempted to ram the minesweeper, but \"Hogan\" avoided her and with 20\\xa0mm fire forced her surrender.\\n\\nIn the days that followed, the minesweeper continued to conduct antisubmarine patrol off Fedhala, searching for submarines that attacked the transports on 11 November. The ship entered Casablanca harbor on 18 November, the invasion a success, and after patrol duties sailed for Norfolk, arriving on 26 December.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" next returned to coastal convoy duties until November 1943. She sailed on 13 November from Norfolk to join the Pacific Fleet, transited the Panama Canal, arriving at Mare Island on 5 December. The minesweeper was needed for the first phase of the long island campaign toward Japan, the invasion of the Marshalls, and sailed for Pearl Harbor and Kwajalein on 16 January 1944. \"Hogan\" carried out anti-submarine patrol off Roi Island before departing on 4 February for Espiritu Santo, where she arrived on 27 February.\\n\\nAfter another period of convoy duty, \"Hogan\" arrived at Milne Bay on 7 April to prepare for the Hollandia operation. The attack group sailed on 18 April and arrived at Humboldt Bay four days later. \"Hogan\" and other minesweepers cleared enemy mines for Admiral Daniel Barbey\\'s invasion force, after which the ship carried out shore bombardment and screening duties. She arrived at Cape Sudest with on 25 April.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" sailed from Eniwetok on 10 June to make preliminary sweeps of Saipan for the invasion to come. She remained off Saipan during the assault on 15 June, coming under enemy shore fire, and moved to Guam the next day. As the Japanese fleet moved toward the Marianas for a decisive naval battle, \"Hogan\" returned to Saipan to protect the transports. In the great carrier battle which followed 19–20 June, the American fleet won a stunning victory, crippling the Japanese naval air arm and securing the Marianas operation from interference. \"Hogan\" returned to the staging base at Eniwetok on 30 June, but returned to Guam on 12 July to carry out screening and minesweeping duties for the assault there. She arrived at Espiritu Santo on 5 August 1944.\\n\\nFollowing a tour of escort duty in the Solomons, \"Hogan\" steamed via Pearl Harbor to San Francisco for repairs, arriving on 5 October. As the recapture of the Philippines gained momentum, the ship steamed from San Francisco on 6 November and arrived at the Manus staging area on 4 December 1944. Moving to Leyte Gulf before Christmas, \"Hogan\" sortied with the Minesweeping and Hydrographic Group on 2 January 1945. Kamikaze attacks began soon afterward, and continued during the voyage to Lingayen Gulf. The minesweepers entered the invasion area on 2 January and began their sweeping operations. Four of the minesweepers were sunk or damaged, and \"Hogan\"s gunners were busy with attacking aircraft. With the operation well underway, the ship arrived at Leyte Gulf on 16 January.\\n\\nAfter retiring to Tinian, \"Hogan\" sailed once more on 7 February to take part in the important assault on Iwo Jima. During this operation she swept mines, screened transports, and carried out shore bombardment before departing with a group of battleships and their escorts 7 March. Arriving Pearl Harbor on 13 April via Ulithi she continued to San Diego on 3 May 1945.\\n\\n\"Hogan\" underwent major repairs and reclassified AG-105 on 5 June 1945.

Small spermatoceles are relatively common, occurring in an estimated 30 percent of all men. They vary in size from several millimeters to many centimeters. Spermatoceles are generally not painful. However, some men may experience discomfort from larger spermatoceles. They are not cancerous, nor do they cause an increased risk of testicular cancer. Additionally, unlike varicoceles, they do not reduce fertility. \\n\\nSection::::Causes.\\nSpermatoceles can originate as diverticulum from the tubules found in the head of the epididymis. Sperm formation gradually causes the diverticulum to increase in size, causing a spermatocele. They are due to continuity between the epididymis and tunica vaginalis.\\n\\nThey are also believed to result from epididymitis, physical trauma, or vasectomy. Scarring of any part of the epididymis can cause it to become obstructed and in turn form a spermatocele.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nSpermatoceles can be discovered as incidental scrotal masses found on physical examination by a physician. They may also be discovered by self-inspection of the scrotum and testicles.\\n\\nFinding a painless, cystic mass at the head of the epididymis, that transilluminates and can be clearly differentiated from the testicle, is generally sufficient. If uncertainty exists, ultrasonography of the scrotum can confirm if it is spermatocele.\\n\\nSection::::Treatment.\\nSmall cysts are best left alone, as are larger cysts that are an asymptomatic condition. Only when the cysts are causing discomfort and are enlarging in size, or the patient wants spermatocele removed, should a spermatocelectomy be considered. Pain may persist even after removal.\\n\\nSpermatocelectomy can be performed on an outpatient basis, with the use of local or general anesthesia.\\n\\nA spermatocelectomy will not improve fertility.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Spermatocele', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122321'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'nhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1122413', 'text': '1969 United States Grand Prix\\n\\nThe 1969 United States Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held on October 5, 1969, at the Watkins Glen Grand Prix Race Course in Watkins Glen, New York.

Andretti charged ahead from his thirteenth-place grid position, and, when Brabham slowed to avoid Hulme, Andretti bumped rear wheels with the Brabham, knocking the Lotus sideways. Andretti continued for three laps, but his suspension was bent, and he retired. At the end of the first lap, the order was Rindt, Stewart, Hill, Siffert, Jean-Pierre Beltoise, Courage and Ickx.\\nAs they had many times during the season, Rindt and Stewart quickly separated themselves from the rest of the field. On lap 12, Rindt slid wide and allowed Stewart through. The Matra\\'s engine was not running at full strength, however, and it was all Stewart could do to hold off the Austrian, who was bobbing and weaving on both sides, trying to get by. Rindt finally got past on the straight on lap 21, and eventually, the Scot began to fall back.\\nOn lap 33, Stewart\\'s car emitted a puff of smoke, and the next time around, he coasted down the pit lane with no oil pressure. Rindt now led a group of three Brabhams, with Courage ahead of the two works entries of Ickx and Brabham, by 37 seconds. On lap 62, Brabham got by Ickx and began hounding Courage. Several times, the Australian managed to pull alongside, but could not complete the pass. Ickx dropped out of the three-way fight on lap 78 when he suddenly lost oil pressure and pulled to the side of the track.\\n\\nRindt was content to maintain his cushion over Courage and Brabham, and tried not to think about all the times he had led before and not won. On lap 88, Hill spun off the track on a patch of oil and stalled. He unfastened his straps, got out of the car and push-started it, but could not refasten his belts alone. His off-track excursion had apparently punctured a rear tire, and he signaled the pit to get ready to change it. Before he made it back around, however, the tire exploded at the end of the straight and sent the Lotus cartwheeling into an embankment. Hill was thrown from the car and suffered broken bones in both legs. Later, at the hospital, he was asked by team members if he had a message to pass along to his wife. Hill replied, \"Just tell her that I won\\'t be dancing for two weeks.\" Hill\\'s accident was witnessed by two fifteen-year-old boys from nearby Montrose, Pennsylvania, John Moore and Kevin Hibbard. Their eyewitness account stated that \"It looked like the crash was unsurvivable. We thought he had definitely been killed.\"\\n\\nBrabham had to break off his pursuit of Courage when his engine began sputtering for lack of fuel, and he was forced to pit on lap 93, allowing Surtees to get through into third place. Rindt crossed the line 46 seconds ahead of Courage with his long-awaited and well-deserved first win. He said, \"It is just that the car held together for once, but this one makes up for all the others I have lost.\" Once again, the American race offered a record purse, and the total of $206,000 included $50,000 for the winner.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': '1969 United States Grand Prix', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122413'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'nxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1122561', 'text': '1972 Canadian Grand Prix\\n\\nThe 1972 Canadian Grand Prix was a Formula One motor race held at Mosport Park on 24 September 1972.

Reshammiya has claimed the story is based on his own life and was named after his music album \"Aap Kaa Surroor\". It was shot mostly in Germany and was released on 29 June 2007. Critics panned the film although it turned out to be a super hit of 2007.\\n\\nSection::::Synopsis.\\nThe movie begins with a dead body of a TV journalist, Nadia Merchant, being found in a remote area, somewhere in Germany. Soon after, the most famous Indian singer HR (Himesh Reshammiya) is arrested after a concert for murdering the journalist. HR is put behind bars and the incidents begin to unravel as the movie goes into a flashback. While on a concert in Germany, performing with his best friend Shravan, HR meets the event organizer Khurana (Darshan Jariwala) and his partner Ruby James (Mallika Sherawat). He also meets the event planner Riya (Hansika Motwani), and it\\'s love at first sight. After initial reservations, Ria\\'s father (Sachin Khedekar) approves of the match.\\n\\nThings take a turn when HR is arrested. He asks Ruby, a lawyer, to bail him out. But hell hath no fury like a woman scorned: Ruby is in love with HR, but the rock star loves Riya. He escapes from his prison cell after taking the murdered TV journalist\\'s father Feroz (Raj Babbar) captive. He has to find the actual murderer in one day or else his sweetheart will be married to someone else. To stop this from happening, he needs Riya\\'s help. He approaches her; she is currently ignoring him.\\n\\nHR, Shravan, and Bani (Gurbani Judge) approach Ruby (on HR\\'s hunch that Ruby is innocent of the murders) for help. They browse through all the Invoices and other Documents in Khurana\\'s Office to find that acute losses on a previously finalized world tour deal gave Khurana the motive to frame HR.

Coventry City transferred him to Waterford in the summer of 1967 and he stayed with the Blues until 1975. Thomas is associated with bringing a new style of goalkeeping to the League of Ireland. He rarely kicked the ball on the offensive, throwing when possible with great accuracy. He also represented the League of Ireland XI and won five league medals and a FAI Cup medal and played in 12 European Cup matches for Waterford. It is not an exaggeration to say that Peter Thomas is a living legend in League of Ireland history and an almost mythical figure in Waterford football fans' memories.\\n\\nIn 1975, he moved to the United States where he played for the Washington Diplomats of the North American Soccer League.

The majority of constitutive heterochromatin is found at the pericentromeric regions of chromosomes, but is also found at the telomeres and throughout the chromosomes. In humans there is significantly more constitutive heterochromatin found on chromosomes 1, 9, 16, 19 and Y. Constitutive heterochromatin is composed mainly of high copy number tandem repeats known as satellite repeats, minisatellite and microsatellite repeats, and transposon repeats. In humans these regions account for about 200Mb or 6.5% of the total human genome, but their repeat composition makes them difficult to sequence, so only small regions have been sequenced.\\n\\nVisualization of constitutive heterochromatin is possible by using the C-banding technique. The regions that stain darker are regions of constitutive heterochromatin. The constitutive heterochromatin stains darker because of the highly condensed nature of the DNA.\\n\\nConstitutive heterochromatin is not to be confused with facultative heterochromatin, which is less condensed, less stable, and much less polymorphic, and which does not stain when using the C-banding technique.\\nSection::::Function.\\nConstitutive heterochromatin is found more commonly in the periphery of the nucleus attached to the nuclear membrane. This concentrates the euchromatic DNA in the center of the nucleus where it can be actively transcribed. During mitosis it is believed that constitutive heterochromatin is necessary for proper segregation of sister chromatids and centromere function. The repeat sequences found at the pericentromeres are not conserved throughout many species and depend more on epigenetic modifications for regulation, while telomeres show more conserved sequences.\\n\\nConstitutive heterochromatin was thought to be relatively devoid of genes, but researchers have found more than 450 genes in the heterochromatic DNA of \"Drosophila melanogaster.\" These regions are highly condensed and epigenetically modified to prevent transcription. For the genes to be transcribed, they must have a mechanism to overcome the silencing that occurs in the rest of the heterochromatin. There are many proposed models for how the genes in these regions are expressed, including the insulation, denial, integration, exploitation, and TE restraining models.\\n\\nWhen genes are placed near a region of constitutive heterochromatin, their transcription is usually silenced. This is known as position-effect variegation and can lead to a mosaic phenotype.\\n\\nSection::::Replication and epigenetics.\\nConstitutive heterochromatin is replicated late in S phase of the cell cycle and does not participate in meiotic recombination.\\n\\nHistone modifications are one of the main ways that the cell condenses constitutive heterochromatin. The three most common modifications in constitutive heterochromatin are histone hypoacetylation, histone H3-Lys9 methylation (H3K9), and cytosine methylation. These modifications are also found in other types of DNA, but much less frequently. Cytosine methylation is the most common type, although it is not found in all eukaryotes. In humans there is increased methylation at the centromeres and telomeres, which are composed of constitutive heterochromatin. These modifications can persist through both mitosis and meiosis and are heritable.\\n\\nSUV39H1 is a histone methyltransferase that methylates H3K9, providing a binding site for heterochromatin protein 1 (HP1). HP1 is involved in the chromatin condensing process that makes DNA inaccessible for transcription.\\n\\nSection::::Diseases.\\nGenetic disorders that result from mutations involving the constitutive heterochromatin tend to affect cell differentiation and are inherited in an autosomal recessive pattern. Disorders include Roberts syndrome and ICF syndrome.\\n\\nSome cancers are associated with anomalies in constitutive heterochromatin and the proteins involved in its formation and maintenance. Breast cancer is linked to a decrease in the HP1 alpha protein, while non-Hodgkin\\'s lymphoma is linked to hypomethylation of the genome and especially of satellite regions.\\n', 'title': 'Constitutive heterochromatin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1122945'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'phhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11229767', 'text': 'Crazy like a Fox\\n\\nThe phrase \"crazy like a fox\" may refer to:\\n', 'title': 'Crazy like a Fox', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11229767'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'pxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11229889', 'text': 'Codex Rehdigeranus\\n\\nCodex Rehdigerianus designated by \"l\" or by 11 (in Besauron numbering), is a medieval Latin manuscript written on parchment, which was held in the city library of Breslau.

It proceeds north as a divided, four-lane highway along Williams Boulevard through a largely residential neighborhood known as Kenner Heights.

Now flanked by commercial establishments, LA\\xa049 continues north through the center of the Highway Park subdivision. After another , LA\\xa049 intersects Veterans Memorial Boulevard, the principal east–west commercial thoroughfare of Kenner and neighboring Metairie. Here it widens to a divided, six-lane highway and remains in that capacity for the remainder of its route. It then immediately enters a complex interchange with I-10 at exit 223. I-10 heads toward Baton Rouge to the west and New Orleans to the east.\\n\\nJust north of the I-10 interchange, LA\\xa049 intersects 32nd Street, which leads to the nearby Esplanade Mall. LA\\xa049 continues north through intersections with West Esplanade Avenue and Vintage Drive as it passes alongside the Driftwood Park neighborhood. The route ends later at an intersection with a local road known as Joe Yenni Boulevard on the west and 44th Street on the east. Williams Boulevard continues north a short distance past the Pontchartrain Center, a large multi-purpose arena, to the Laketown recreation area and the Treasure Chest Casino on Lake Pontchartrain.\\n\\nThe route is classified as an urban principal arterial south of I-10 and an urban minor arterial north of I-10 by the Louisiana Department of Transportation and Development (La\\xa0DOTD). Average daily traffic volume in 2013 is reported as follows: 20,700 from the southern terminus to West Metairie Avenue; 34,200 to Veterans Memorial Boulevard; and 48,200 to the northern terminus.

The first was State Route 452, designated in 1928. Route 452 followed Williams Boulevard from 3rd Street northward to what was then the Kenner city limits at 19th Street (now West Metairie Avenue). At the time, 3rd Street was part of the main route between New Orleans and Baton Rouge, followed first by the Jefferson Highway auto trail in 1916. This became State Route 1 in 1921 and the original route of US 61 in 1926.\\n\\nIn 1930, State Route 1249 was designated as an extension of Route 452, continuing the route of Williams Boulevard from 19th Street northward to Route 33.\\n\\nRoute 33 was the New Orleans–Hammond Lakeshore Highway, an ambitious scenic highway project that was intended to be part of US 51 but never completed. From 1933 to 1939, the section of Williams Boulevard south of Airline Highway served as a temporary link in US 61 while Airline Highway was being reconstructed between Kenner and Shrewsbury.\\n\\nLater maps show the entirety of Williams Boulevard as Route 1249 only, apparently absorbing Route 452, and remaining so until the 1955 Louisiana Highway renumbering.\\n\\nSection::::Post-1955 route history.\\nLA\\xa049 was created in 1955 as a direct renumbering of Route 1249.\\n\\nAt this time, the route still followed the entirety of Williams Boulevard from the Mississippi River at 3rd Street, which was now LA\\xa048, to Lake Pontchartrain. Since the late 1980s redevelopment of Kenner\\'s riverfront as the Rivertown Historic District, the southern portion of the route between LA\\xa048 and US\\xa061 has been returned to local control. The northern end of LA\\xa049 has also been slightly shortened from its original terminus at the Lake Pontchartrain levee.\\n\\nSection::::Future.\\nLa\\xa0DOTD is currently engaged in a program that aims to transfer about of state-owned roadways to local governments over the next several years. Under this plan of \"right-sizing\" the state highway system, the portion of LA\\xa049 north of I-10 is proposed for deletion as it does not meet a significant interurban travel function.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Louisiana Highway 49', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11230852'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1123147', 'text': \"1992 Italian Grand Prix\\n\\nThe 1992 Italian Grand Prix (formally the Pioneer 63 Gran Premio d'Italia) was a Formula One motor race held at Monza on 13 September 1992.

Patrese managed to overtake Alesi at the start of lap 2. The opening laps saw both Berger and Schumacher recovering many positions from the back of the field and overtaking a number of slower cars.\\n\\nAt the front Mansell opened a gap with Senna unable to match his pace. The positions were Mansell, Senna with Patrese closing down on him and then the two Ferraris of Alesi and Capelli. Next Martin Brundle managed to overtake Capelli and moved into 5th position. Lap 12 proved disastrous for the Ferrari team with both cars retiring, Alesi, who was in 4th, due to a mechanical problem and Capelli spinning off at the Parabolica with electronic problems. On lap 14 Patrese overtook Senna and moved into second. Meanwhile, Berger pitted for new tyres and dropped back again. On lap 17 the situation was Mansell in first, 10 seconds in front of Patrese, then Senna at 2 seconds from the second Williams. Fourth was Brundle, some 28 seconds behind Mansell and then Boutsen and Herbert at over 40 seconds from Mansell. Lap 18 saw Herbert retiring from 6th with an engine issue.\\n\\nOn lap 20 Patrese suddenly appeared in the lead as Mansell let his teammate take the lead. The order was Patrese followed closely by Mansell and Senna in third. Schumacher overtook Boutsen and moved into 5th place. Positions at lap 27 were: 1.Patrese, 2.Mansell, 3.Senna, 4.Brundle, 5.Schumacher and 6.Boutsen. As the lead trio lapped the slower cars of Berger and Comas Mansell continued to stay very close to Patrese and Senna tried his best not to lose contact with the two Williams cars as well, in fact he closed up on Mansell momentarily when the Williams had to take avoiding action of Comas at the Roggia. On lap 41 Mansell slowed through the Ascari bends and coasted into the pits with gearbox failure from loss of hydraulic pressure and had to retire. Classification at lap 44 was: Patrese, Senna at 6 secs, Brundle at 28 secs, Schumacher at over 50 secs, then Berger and De Cesaris both a lap down. Patrese led comfortably until 6 laps from the end he suffered a hydraulic problem, forcing him to slow down and concede the lead to Ayrton Senna. In the closing stages of the race Senna allowed his teammate Berger to unlap himself. Patrese limped to the end of the race and finished 5th.\\n\\nSenna won the race in what turned to be his last win with a Honda-powered car. The other places on the podium went to the two Benettons of Brundle and Schumacher.\\n\\n\\n\", 'title': '1992 Italian Grand Prix', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123147'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11235634', 'text': 'National Museum of Fine Arts, Malta\\n\\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts () was an art museum in Valletta, Malta. It housed a collection of works by Maltese and foreign artists mainly representing the major European artistic styles. The museum was inaugurated on 7 May 1974, and it was located at Admiralty House, an 18th-century palace which was formerly the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet. The museum was closed down on 2 October 2016, and there are plans to reopen it as MUŻA (from the Maltese acronym \"Mużew tal-Arti\") at Auberge d\\'Italie in 2018.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe National Museum of Fine Arts, at the Admiralty House, was inaugurated by Minister of Education and Culture Agatha Barbara on 7 May 1974. Its collection had previously formed part of the National Museum at Auberge de Provence. Following the split, the museum at the auberge was left with archaeological artifacts, and it was renamed the National Museum of Archaeology. The museum was managed by Heritage Malta.\\n\\nIn 2013, plans began to be made to move the museum from Admiralty House to Auberge d\\'Italie. In September 2014, it was announced that the move will occur and the new museum would be called \"MUŻA\" (from the Maltese acronym \"Mużew Nazzjonali tal-Arti\"). The museum at Admiralty House closed down on 2 October 2016, and the new museum is set to open in 2018 as one of the projects of Valletta\\'s title of European Capital of Culture.\\n\\nThe museum saw 30,000 patrons every day in 2012 and the relocation aim to increase the number of visitors.\\n\\nSection::::Location.\\nThe museum was housed at the Admiralty House, a palace in Valletta, originally built in the 16th century as a residence for the knight Fra Jean de Soubiran dit Arafat. The present building dates back to 1761–63, when it was reconstructed in the Baroque style for the Portuguese knight Fra Raimondo de Sousa y Silva. From 1821 to 1961, the building was the official residence of the Commander-in-Chief of the Mediterranean Fleet, hence the name \"Admiralty House\". \\n\\nAdmiralty House is located at South Street in Valletta. Apart from the museum itself, the area contains several fine historical palaces dating from the times of the Order of St. John that are now used by government ministries and departments. It is also well known for its wine bars and cafes, and views of the city\\'s grid-shaped streets.\\n\\nSection::::Collections.\\nSection::::Fine arts.\\nThe museum housed the major part of the national collection of Malta. The collection began in 1923 when the first fine arts curator, Vincenzo Bonello, embarked on establishing a collection within what was then called the National Museum. Bonello acquired numerous works of excellent quality on the local art market, and in London and Italy. Most were purchased at a time when prices in the art market where still within reach of the museum\\'s modest budget. Public spirited individuals and organizations also left significant bequests. \\nThe permanent display included the largest collection of paintings by the Southern Italian Baroque artist Mattia Preti (1613–1699), an Italian Knight of the Order of Malta who also contributed to the transformation of the interior of St. John’s Co-Cathedral in Valletta. This, together with a fine and rare collection of antique maps, represented one of the strengths of the collection.\\n\\nThe works of other artists on display included Guido Reni (1575–1642), the Caravaggisti Valentin de Boulogne (1591–1632), Giuseppe Ribera (1591–1662) and Matthias Stom (1600–1652), as well as Carlo Maratta (1625–1713) and Bernardo Strozzi (1581–1644). Works by Dutch, French and British artists were also on permanent display.\\n\\nThe collection also included the works of two outstanding Maltese sculptors, Melchiorre Gafà (1636–1667) and Antonio Sciortino (1879–1947), and a noteworthy group of Maltese landscapes. The Grand Harbour of Malta and its environs is the subject of a Joseph Mallord William Turner (1775–1851) watercolour. Other works by Edward Lear (1812–1888), Louis Ducros (1748–1810) and local artists representing the same subject were also on display.\\n\\nSection::::Furniture and silverware.\\nThe museum exhibited a collection of Maltese furniture and silverware, as well as majolica jars mainly of Sicilian production. Many of the jars were in use at the Sacra Infermeria, the Hospital of the Order of St John. Ecclesiastical silverware was also on display, including a rare fifteenth century chalice of Parisian workmanship.\\n\\nSection::::Temporary exhibitions.\\nThe museum had a very active calendar of temporary exhibitions mainly by Maltese artists.

Brunner was subsequently arrested for numerous offenses, including credit card theft and armed robbery, and served a prison sentence at the California Institution for Women.\\n\\nSection::::Meeting Charles Manson.\\nBorn and raised in Eau Claire, Wisconsin, to George and Elsie Brunner, she moved to California upon graduating from the University of Wisconsin–Madison in 1965 and took up a job as library assistant at UC Berkeley. She met 33-year-old career criminal Charles Manson who had been released from Terminal Island prison several weeks earlier. She let Manson stay at her apartment and, after a period of weeks, the two became lovers. Brunner was thus the first person Manson recruited into his Family. She quit her job and the two began to drift around California in a van meeting other young women. \\n\\nDuring the summer of 1967, Manson impregnated Brunner. On April 15, 1968 she gave birth to a son she named Valentine Michael, nicknamed \"Pooh Bear\" (Valentine Michael Smith is the name of the protagonist in Robert Heinlein\\'s 1961 novel \"Stranger In A Strange Land\") in a condemned house in Topanga Canyon and was assisted during the birth by several of the young women from the Family. Brunner (like most members of the group) acquired a number of aliases and nicknames, including: \"Marioche\", \"Och\", \"Mother Mary\", \"Mary Manson\", \"Linda Dee Manson\" and \"Christine Marie Euchts\". \\n\\nAfter arriving in Venice, California, Brunner and Manson met 18-year-old Lynette Fromme and the three began living together in a rented house at 636 Cole Street in San Francisco. Over the course of the following two years, the Family enlarged to include between 20 and 30 individuals living communally; some, like Brunner and Fromme, became ardent followers of Manson, while others drifted in and out of the group. \\n\\nAfter traveling along the California coast and excursions to Washington, Oregon and Nevada, the ever-growing number of young women and men eventually settled down at Spahn Ranch, an occasional film set operated by George Spahn, near the Los Angeles suburb of Chatsworth. Manson ostensibly based his commune on principles of freedom and love, but he exerted dictatorial control. In addition to having sex with Spahn and others, the female followers were sent to the city on criminal activities such as theft and fraud. Manson also had illegal firearms and played host to a motorcycle gang.\\n\\nSection::::Early arrest.\\nOn April 21, 1968 Brunner and Family members Manson, Susan Atkins, Ella Jo Bailey, Dianne Elizabeth Lake, Nancy Laura Pitman, Bruce Vann Hall, Marcus John Arneson and Suzanne Scott were arrested near Little Sycamore Canyon, in southern Ventura County, California. They were found sprawled nude around a campfire beside a 1952 bus \"stuck in a deep ditch\", that had been reported stolen in San Francisco on April 12. Manson was remanded into custody under the suspicion of grand theft auto and possession of two driver licenses. \\n\\nScott, Atkins, Lake and Hall were charged with possessing fictitious and fraudulent driver\\'s licenses. Pitman, Arneson and Bailey were jailed on charges of disorderly conduct and not possessing proper identification. Five other Family members were released without being charged. Brunner was booked on endangering the life and health of a child, after her one-week-old son, Valentine was found by deputies improperly dressed and shivering. The baby was placed in the care of the Ventura County General Hospital. \\n\\nCharges against Brunner were later reduced to contributing to the delinquency of a minor and she was given two years probation and a 15-day suspended jail sentence. She subsequently told authorities she planned to return to her parents\\' home in Wisconsin and Valentine was returned to her.\\n\\nSection::::The Hinman murder.\\nOn July 25, 1969, 21-year-old Family member, musician and aspiring actor Bobby Beausoleil left Spahn Ranch, accompanied by Brunner and group member Susan Atkins to pay a visit to an associate named Gary Allen Hinman at his home in Topanga Canyon, directly north of Malibu. Hinman had been friendly with the Family and had often allowed members to stay at his home. Both Beausoleil and Brunner had previously lived with Hinman for short periods of time and, according to a 1981 interview with Beausoleil, Brunner was close friends with Hinman. Beausoleil was in possession of a knife and a 9\\xa0mm Radom pistol that he had borrowed from Family member Bruce Davis.\\n\\nOn July 31, 1969, Hinman was found murdered in his home. His face had been deeply slashed on the left side and he had two stab wounds to the chest. Hinman\\'s house had been ransacked and the words \"Political Piggy\" written and a paw print (intended to be symbolic of the Black Panther Party) drawn on the wall in his blood. Both of Hinman\\'s vehicles were missing: a Volkswagen van and a Fiat station wagon. On August 5, 1969, Beausoleil was found by the California Highway Patrol asleep in the back of Hinman\\'s Fiat near San Luis Obispo, California. Beausoleil had a sheath knife attached to his belt. Robert Kenneth \"Bobby\" Beausoleil was arrested and charged with the murder of Gary Allen Hinman.\\n\\nOn August 8, 1969, Brunner and another Family member, Sandra Good, were arrested in San Fernando, California at a Sears store for purchasing items with a stolen credit card. Brunner had signed for her purchases with the alias \"Mary Vitasek\" and the two women fled the store when a cashier became suspicious. After being followed by the store manager, the police caught up with the two and found them in possession of numerous stolen credit cards and fake identification cards. They were charged with violating Section 459 (burglary) and 484e (grand theft by fraudulent use of credit card) of the California Penal Code and booked into the Sybil Brand Institute Reception Center later that evening.\\nOn the night of August 9, Family members Charles \"Tex\" Watson, Susan Atkins, Linda Kasabian and Patricia Krenwinkel went to 10050 Cielo Drive and murdered pregnant actress Sharon Tate and her guests Wojciech Frykowski, Jay Sebring and Abigail Folger, as well as 18-year-old Steven Parent, who was visiting Tate\\'s groundskeeper William Garretson.\\n\\nSection::::Prosecution witness.\\nThere is agreement that Manson was behind the killing of Hinman. Brunner was present throughout and was the key witness for the prosecution. She testified at Beausoleil\\'s trial that Beausoleil killed Hinman (a musician), because Hinman had refused to join Manson\\'s pop group.\\n\\nSection::::Other hypotheses.\\nThere have been many other suggestions. Vincent Bugliosi, who was the prosecutor in the Tate-LaBianca case, claimed in his book that Manson instructed Beausoleil, Brunner and Atkins to go to Hinman\\'s house to get money and titles to Hinman\\'s vehicles. This account was later corroborated by various Family members. However, Beausoleil denied Manson\\'s direct involvement and disputed that neither Brunner nor Atkins had any direct knowledge of why he was visiting Hinman. \\n\\nBeausoleil contended that he went to Hinman\\'s home in order to confront Hinman and collect $1,000 from him. Beausoleil claimed that he had purchased from Hinman tabs of mescaline that he then sold to a biker gang called the Straight Satans. He further explained that several hours after the gang purchased the mescaline from Beausoleil, they showed up at Spahn Ranch, claiming the mescaline was poisoned with strychnine, demanded their money back and threatened to kill Beausoleil. \\n\\nBeausoleil contended that both Brunner and Atkins merely went along with him to Hinman\\'s because they \"liked\" Hinman and wanted to visit. In the interview, he states that neither he nor Brunner nor Atkins were instructed by Manson to go to Hinman\\'s and that he initially had no intention to kill him. This contradicted Beausoleil\\'s own testimony at his first trial in 1969, when he claimed that Manson did in fact instruct him to kill Hinman. Beausoleil claimed \"Mary Brunner was just scared to death. She just faded into the woodwork\" during the murder, but that Atkins went back into the house after Beausoleil stabbed Hinman and placed a pillow over Hinman\\'s face. He also contended that it was Atkins who wrote the words \"Political Piggy\" on Hinman\\'s wall (at Beausoleil\\'s instructions).\\nIn October 1969, police raided the Family\\'s new residence at Barker Ranch near Death Valley, California, holding most of the group in custody on charges of automobile theft. Among those arrested were Atkins, who, while being questioned by police sergeants Whitley and Guenther on October 13, 1969, implicated herself in the murder of Hinman and told the officers that Manson had sent her and Beausoleil to Hinman\\'s residence to force Hinman to hand over money that Manson believed Hinman had inherited. Atkins also told the police that Beausoleil alone acted in the murder of Hinman, stabbing him twice in the heart after detaining him in his home for over two days. Atkins also maintained that it was Beausoleil who slashed Hinman\\'s face, not Manson. However, Atkins gave several differing accounts of the murder of Hinman; at times claiming that she killed Hinman, Manson killed Hinman or that Beausoleil killed Hinman.\\n\\nSection::::Trial.\\nMary Brunner and Susan Atkins were subsequently charged along with Bobby Beausoleil for the murder of Gary Hinman. Brunner later received immunity from prosecution to testify against both Beausoleil and Atkins.<ref name=\"Crime/Punishment\">Mary Brunner profile, crime.about.com; accessed March 17, 2017.</ref> His first trial, which began in November 1969 ended in a hung jury, with Beausoleil claiming that Manson alone had murdered Hinman.\\n\\nHowever, during Beausoleil\\'s March 1970 trial, Brunner repudiated her testimony that Beausoleil murdered Hinman and Beausoleil produced an affidavit signed by Brunner stating that he did not stab Hinman. Called to the stand to testify, Brunner eventually repudiated her previous testimony and insisted that she had said Beausoleil stabbed Hinman to death in her attempt to absolve Charles Manson of any participation in the crime. Various former Family members such as Ella Jo Bailey contradicted this testimony and testified that Manson confessed to them that he in fact was present at the Hinman house and that he fully participated in the murder.\\n\\nBeausoleil was sentenced to death, later commuted to life (See \"California v. Anderson\"); Atkins pleaded guilty for her participation in Hinman\\'s death and was sentenced to life imprisonment. Bruce Davis was charged in the murder after it was learned Beausoleil had called Davis at Spahn Ranch and asked him to come over and pick up Hinman\\'s Volkswagen van. Separate trials were held for the murders of Gary Hinman and Spahn Ranch worker Donald \"Shorty\" Shea, for Family members Davis, Charles Manson, and Steve \"Clem\" Grogan.\\n\\nBrunner subsequently returned to the remaining members of the Family and rallied support for those incarcerated for the Tate/LaBianca murders. Her son was sent to live with her parents.\\n\\nSection::::Hawthorne shootout.\\nOn August 21, 1971, Brunner, accompanied by Family member Catherine \"Gypsy\" Share and several male Family associates — Dennis Rice, Charles Lovett, Larry Bailey, and Kenneth Como — drove a white van to a Hawthorne, California Western Surplus Store. Once inside the store, the group brandished guns and ordered the store patrons and clerks to lie on the ground. They then took 143 rifles from the premises, loading them into their van, while a store clerk tripped the silent alarm. According to police officers, the group then debated whether to kill all of those in the store.\\n\\nPolice alleged the group\\'s plan was to hijack a Boeing 747 and threaten to kill one passenger every hour until Manson and fellow Family members were released from prison. When a police squad car arrived, Share opened fire on the vehicle, shattering the windshield. As more squad cars arrived, they blocked the van from fleeing the scene, spraying it with over 50 bullets; the Family members fired nearly 20 rounds at the officers. When police finally gained control of the scene and apprehended the group, Mary Brunner, Catherine Share, and Larry Bailey were injured.\\n\\nBrunner was convicted and received a sentence of 20 years to life, She was sent to the California Institution for Women, where Leslie Van Houten, Susan Atkins and Patricia Krenwinkel were serving their sentences for their participation in the Tate-LaBianca murders. Brunner disappeared from the public eye after being paroled in 1977.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Mary Brunner', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11235759'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1123698', 'text': 'End-to-end delay\\n\\nEnd-to-end delay or one-way delay (OWD) refers to the time taken for a packet to be transmitted across a network from source to destination. It is a common term in IP network monitoring, and differs from round-trip time (RTT) in that only path in the one direction from source to destination is measured.\\n\\nSection::::Measurement.\\nThe ping utility measures the RTT, that is, the time to go and come back to a host. Half the RTT is often used as an approximation of OWD but this assumes that the forward and back paths are the same in terms of congestion, number of hops, or quality of service (QoS). This is not always a good assumption. To avoid such problems, the OWD may be measured directly.\\n\\nOWDs may be measured between two points \"A\" and \"B\" of an IP network through the use of synchronized clocks; \"A\" records a timestamp on the packet and sends it to \"B\", which notes the receiving time and calculates the OWD as their difference. The transmitted packets need to be identified at source and destination in order to avoid packet loss or packet reordering. However, this method suffers several limitations, such as requiring intensive cooperation between both parties, and the accuracy of the measured delay is subject to the synchronization precision. \\n\\nThe Minimum-Pairs Protocol is an example by which several cooperating entities, \"A\", \"B\", and \"C\", could measure OWDs between one of them and a fourth less cooperative one (e.g., between \"B\" and \"X\").\\n\\nSection::::Delay components.\\nEnd-to-end-delay in networks comes from several sources including transmission delay, propagation delay, processing delay and queuing delay.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'End-to-end delay', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1123698'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11237007', 'text': \"Lufthansa Center\\n\\nThe Lufthansa Center is a large building complex in Beijing that opened in 1992.

United. His DC team won the MLS Cup in 2004. He retired from the game in February 2011 after being released by Los Angeles Galaxy at the end of the 2010 season.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nSection::::Early life and amateur.\\nKovalenko emigrated to the United States in 1992. He graduated from Greece Arcadia High School in Rochester, New York in 1996, and played three years of college soccer at Indiana University from 1996 to 1998, where he helped the Hoosiers win a national championship in 1998, and was named an NCAA first team All-American in the same year. Was long known in college for his powerful headers, which often left opponents stunned and unable to react to deflections from the goalkeeper or posts. Kovalenko often attributed this to his well developed neck muscles that he said were created from doing hundreds of sets of Ukrainian neck-snaps daily prior to his soccer training.\\n\\nSection::::Professional.\\nUpon joining the league, Kovalenko was originally allocated to the Dallas Burn, but the league complied with his demands to play for the Chicago Fire, engineering a trade to the team in exchange for draft picks. Kovalenko appeared infrequently in his rookie year, playing only 291 minutes in 11 games, but managed to score three goals for the team. Kovalenko made an impact another way, breaking the leg, and effectively ending the career, of Dallas Burn defender Brandon Pollard with a dangerous tackle.\\n\\nKovalenko would come into his own as a player in the 2000 season, scoring ten goals and five assists in 31 games for the Fire, as he helped the team to a U.S. Open Cup victory. The next year, he was moved from a forward position to attacking midfield, but continued to catalyze the Fire offense, scoring eight goals and seven assists in 25 games. In 2001, Kovalenko had trouble scoring, registering only one goal with his eight assists, but was still a dangerous offensive player for the team.\\n\\nAfter the 2001 MLS season, Kovalenko played on loan for FC St. Pauli of the German Bundesliga. Following the 2002 season he was traded, largely because of salary cap problems, to D.C. United in exchange for youngster Justin Mapp. Kovalenko immediately established himself with United, scoring six goals in 24 games in his first season with the team. Also, in what seemed like something of a recurring trend, Kovalenko was again involved in a Dallas Burn injury, when another late tackle broke Burn midfielder Ronnie O\\'Brien\\'s leg, causing him to miss most of the regular season. Kovalenko was fined $1,000 and suspended one game for his actions. Kovalenko continued to be a valuable player in central midfield for D.C. United in 2004, registering two goals and ten assists for the team in 25 games. He was ejected from the championship game for a handball, but DC United held on to win. In 2005, despite losing the early part of the season to a broken foot, he tallied four goals and four assists. He left DC United in January 2006, after being unable to agree on salary terms, and returned to Ukraine. He signed a one-year contract with FC Metalurh Zaporizhzhya.\\n\\nIn August 2006, Kovalenko returned to MLS, after his rights were acquired by New York Red Bulls from DC. The fiery Ukrainian\\'s play in the beginning of the 2007 season had New York challenging in the Eastern Conference, however he was sidelined with injury and the team began to struggle. Kovalenko was able to return during the latter part of the season, helping the club clinch a playoff berth. He concluded the season appearing in 19 league matches, registering two goals and one assist. He was traded to Real Salt Lake in February 2008.\\n\\nOn 14 January 2009, Salt Lake traded Kovalenko to Los Angeles Galaxy in exchange for a draft pick and an undisclosed sum of allocation money.\\n\\nOn 3 December 2010, LA Galaxy announced Kovalenko\\'s contract would not be renewed for the 2011 MLS season. Kovalenko elected to participate in the 2010 MLS Re-Entry Draft and became a Major League Soccer free agent when he was not selected by any club.\\n\\nHaving been unable to secure a spot on a professional roster for the upcoming season, Kovalenko confirmed his retirement in an interview on 14 February 2011.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Dema Kovalenko', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1125115'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'tRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11255090', 'text': \"St Peter's School, Huntingdon\\n\\nSt Peter's is a secondary school in Huntingdon, Cambridgeshire.

Imperial served a number of cities in Southern California and for a brief period several cities in Arizona.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nImperial was founded as Visco Flying Service in 1964, but later the scheduled passenger service portion of the company changed its name to Imperial Airlines. Visco Flying Service continued to operate as a crop dusting service in the Imperial Valley, for a number of years utilizing Stearman bi-wing biplane aircraft and later added helicopter aerial application as well as a turboprop powered mono-wing crop dusting aircraft. Imperial\\'s passenger carrying operations were operated under FAR135 that initially focused on services from its home base at Imperial County Airport (IPL) in El Centro, CA to San Diego\\'s Lindbergh Field (SAN).\\n\\nOn January 8, 1968, at 10:40\\xa0a.m. an Imperial Beech E18S flown by a single pilot with three passengers aboard crashed shortly after take-off from Lindbergh Field when an engine failed and the pilot was unable to control the aircraft. One passenger survived the accident with serious injuries, according to the NTSB report, LAX68A0065.\\n\\nImperial acquired a Beechcraft Queen Air 65-B80, carrying passengers between the Imperial Valley and San Diego in daily, frequent service. Up to eleven passengers could be accommodated in modest seating that included the co-pilot seat, as the airline operated with a single-pilot only, at that time permitted by the FARs.\\n\\nIn a brief alliance with Borrego Springs, CA based Sun Aire Lines in the mid-1970s a Swearingen Metroliner \"Metro II\" turboprop was placed on the route. The arrangement proved problematic and the two lines went their separate ways, with the high-time Queen Air pressed back into service between Imperial and San Diego. By 1976 there were five or six round trips flown Monday through Friday, none on the weekends, the first departing Imperial at 6 a.m. on the 36-minute flight, with service ending each night just before 8 p.m. back in the \"Valley.\"\\n\\nIn mid-1978 discussions resulted in the airline being sold by James K Vedder to a group of investors from the San Diego area who believed that the deregulated airline environment would provide opportunities not before possible. Soon the lone Queen Air was retired, replaced by four twin engine Cessna 402 prop aircraft and a single twin engine Cessna 404. The route system immediately expanded to Yuma and Phoenix as well as Los Angeles International. About 1980 the airline moved its headquarters to McClellan-Palomar Airport in Carlsbad, California. Later the airline acquired the larger Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante and Short 360 turboprop aircraft for its routes along the southern California coastal corridor in addition to Swearingen Metroliner turboprops and smaller Cessna prop aircraft. For most of the early 1980s, the airline operated flights between San Diego International Airport and Los Angeles International Airport at thirty minutes intervals throughout the day. By 1986 the airline was suffering the effects of increased competition and it ceased operations in January of that year.\\n\\nNonstop service between the Imperial - San Diego city pair no longer exists. For several years circa 2015 SeaPort Airlines utilized the single engine turboprop Cessna Caravan 208 configured with nine seats and provided infrequent service. SeaPort left the market after a short period of operation.\\n\\nSection::::Destinations in 1979.\\nAccording to the airline\\'s system timetable, Imperial was serving the following destinations in Arizona and California in September 1979:\\n\\n\\nImperial flew between LAX and El Centro in 1967/1978 plus I was the travel manager at Mattel and our execs flew to our plant in Mexico via Imperial Airways.\\n\\nSection::::Destinations in 1984.\\nAccording to the airline\\'s route map, Imperial was serving the following destinations in California in September 1984:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Aircraft.\\nImperial was operating a mix of Swearingen Metroliner and Embraer EMB-110 Bandeirante turboprops as well as smaller Cessna 402 and Cessna 404 prop aircraft during the early 1980s and had earlier operated Beech 18 prop aircraft.

White plays in hypermodern style, attacking the center from the flanks with pieces rather than occupying it with pawns. These openings are played often, and 1.Nf3 and 1.c4 trail only 1.e4 and 1.d4 in popularity as opening moves.\\n\\nSection::::Classification.\\nIn addition, some flank openings that are considered irregular:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Zukertort Opening (1.Nf3).\\nIf White opens with 1.Nf3, the game often becomes one of the d4 openings (closed games or semi-closed games) by a different move order (this is called \"transposition\"), but unique openings such as the Réti and King\\'s Indian Attack are also common. The Réti itself is characterized by White playing 1.Nf3, fianchettoing one or both bishops, and not playing an early d4 (which would generally transpose into one of the 1.d4 openings).\\n\\nThe King\\'s Indian Attack (KIA) is a system of development that White may use in reply to almost any Black opening moves.\\nThe characteristic KIA setup is 1.Nf3, 2.g3, 3.Bg2, 4.0-0, 5.d3, 6.Nbd2, and 7.e4, although these moves may be played in many different orders. In fact, the KIA is probably most often reached after 1.e4 when White uses it to respond to a Black attempt to play one of the semi-open games such as the Caro-Kann, French, or Sicilian, or even the open games which usually come after 1.e4 e5.\\nIts greatest appeal may be that by adopting a set pattern of development, White can avoid the large amount of opening study required to prepare to meet the many different possible Black replies to 1.e4.\\n\\nSection::::English Opening (1.c4).\\nThe English also frequently transposes into a d4 opening, but it can take on independent character as well including symmetrical variations (1.c4 c5) and the Sicilian Defense in reverse (1.c4 e5).\\n\\nSection::::Bird\\'s Opening (1.f4).\\nWith Bird\\'s Opening White tries to get a strong grip on the e5-square. The opening can resemble a Dutch Defense in reverse after 1.f4 d5, or Black may try to disrupt White by playing 1...e5!?

Customers entered codes found on specially marked packages of Coca-Cola products on a website. Codes could also be entered \"on the go\" by texting them from a cell phone. These codes were converted into virtual \"points\" which could in turn be redeemed by members for various prizes or sweepstakes entries. The number of points from each product depended on the brand as well as the item itself.\\n\\nThe program was launched in late February 2006, and ended in late June 2017. By November 2006, over a million prizes had been redeemed. The program had since been extended annually since its inception, but terminated on June 30, 2017. Any points left over from one year by one member carried over into the next, provided the member had accrued or debited points within a 90-day period. Current members had from late March to late June 2017 to redeem any points accumulated over the years. Leftover points were then donated to charity. In September 2013, the My Coke Rewards Beta was launched. The new system which ran on the same website, but with /beta after the .com on the address, used social media challenges and My Coke Rewards codes to gain \"status\" points to level up, with +5 status points just by creating an account. The levels were bronze, silver, and gold, which replaced the test phase levels of Red, Gold, and Twilight, and points or status were rewarded when a user leveled up. The \"status\" points were discontinued in mid-June 2016. The program ended in late June 2017.\\n\\nSection::::Limitations.\\nThe program always featured limits on the number of codes and points that could be redeemed at one time. Before February 17, 2009, members were limited to entering 10 codes per day, regardless of the number of points that this represented. Members who entered 10 codes from 32-can packages could, under this system, earn a total of 250 points per day, or 1,750 per week. This represented the maximum rate at which points could be accrued without the use of bonus points and similar promotions.\\n\\nIn February 2009, this system was changed. Up until mid-to-late January 2015, members had been limited to entering 100 points per week (through mid-to-late March 2017, 75), regardless of the number of codes redeemed per day (before that, the limit was 120 to early January 2014). Bonus points and promotional offers such as “Double Points Days” were still not subject to this weekly limit. My Coke Rewards had a meter that tells the member how many points they earned during the current week, and whether they have reached the 75 point-per-week limit. Attempts to enter codes that exceed the limit (for example, entering any code which will exceed 75 points) do not cause overflow; the participant was told to “hold on to that code”. (Any bonus points were limited to 2,000 points per week. The limit a member can bank is 10,000 points total weekly.)\\n\\nPlus, the program had an expiration date on the codes that have been entered, or through end of June 2017. Points expired after that date, meaning a customer had to add points to their account or claim a prize by the deadline.\\n\\nIn the UK version of the program, Coke Zone, customers could also avert point expiration by simply logging on to the website. Their codes are issued on a time-limited basis and expire at the end of the month containing the best before date of the relevant product. This program ended on 15 October 2013, and all points earned were voided at 11:59 pm on that date.\\n\\nSection::::Code reuse.\\nThere were two types of codes: single-use and multi-use codes. Single-use codes like those found on Coke products contained a mix of letters and numbers. These codes could only be used once; if they have been entered in any account they will not work again. By contrast, multi-use codes were identified by being all numeric and could be entered by multiple users. The multi-use codes all started with the digits 10008. They have been distributed through email, including during the 2006 Christmas holiday season, as well as through direct mail and print advertising campaigns in various magazines and other publications. Both Blockbuster and Disney (with \"Pirates of the Caribbean\") have participated in such special promotions.\\n\\nSection::::Controversy.\\nThe program was one of several marketing campaigns that have come under fire from the Center for Digital Democracy, an advocacy group interested in regulating how food products are marketed to children. Coca-Cola\\'s online marketing techniques were included in a 98-page report issued in May 2007 by the center and the American University called \"Interactive Food & Beverage Marketing: Targeting Children and Youth\" which criticized the program for collecting personal information from children and for promoting obesity.\\n\\nChildhood obesity was also a concern for weight-loss instructor Julia Griggs Havey who sued Coca-Cola over the program in 2006, but dropped her lawsuit a few weeks later. The lawsuit was dropped for the specific reason of it being frivolous, since there was a misinterpretation as to what was required of a user in order to accumulate Coke points and obtain the currently available reward prizes. The first assumption—that those who have Coke codes must purchase the product in order to redeem them—was shown to be untrue, as Coke stated they took into consideration that users may obtain codes from others. Second, it was pointed out that the Coca-Cola Company has other products besides Coca-Cola, including Minute Maid juice, Powerade, Powerade Zero and Dasani water, for those who do not wish to consume high amounts of high-fructose corn syrup or caffeine. Additionally, many grocery stores and discount stores offer Coca-Cola products (often imported) that are sweetened with sugar instead of high fructose corn syrup.\\n\\nSome customers further accused Coca-Cola of utilizing \"bait-and-switch\" tactics in the program. They claim that the prizes for which they had been saving are either constantly out of stock or are no longer available. Some items experienced steep unexpected price increases, as well; for example the coupons for a free 20 ounce bottle of Coke increased 67% (from 24 points to 40), a $75 Blockbuster gift card which used to cost 722 points went up to 1,020 points (a 41% increase) before being discontinued, a single Napster download went from 35 to 70 points from 2010 to 2011 (and 10 from 350 to 700, a 100% increase), and the price of a GPX docking station went up from 975 points to 1,820 (an 87% increase). These increases took place at the same time as Coca-Cola was taking drastic measures to decrease the number of points awarded (through its February 2009 rule changes which reduced the maximum number of points from 1,750 per week to 75 through 22 March 2017).\\n\\nFor its part, Coca-Cola maintained that all prizes in the My Coke Rewards program are available \"while supplies last,\" and that there was no guarantee expressed or intended that a given prize would either continue to be offered or continue to be offered at the same price.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'My Coke Rewards', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11275110'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11275483', 'text': 'JISD\\n\\nJISD can refer to:\\n', 'title': 'JISD', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11275483'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11279707', 'text': 'Whispering Jack\\n\\nWhispering Jack is the twelfth studio album by Australian adult contemporary pop singer John Farnham. It was produced by Ross Fraser, and released on 20 October 1986, which peaked at #1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Album Charts. \"Whispering Jack\" has become the second best-selling-album in Australia, behind Meatloaf\\'s album \"Bat Out of Hell\", and the highest selling album in Australia by an Australian artist - 24x platinum indicating sales of over 1.68 million copies sold. It spent 25 weeks at the No. 1 spot on the Album Charts during 1986–1987, it was awarded the 1987 ARIA Award for \"Album of the Year\", and was the best charting album for the decade of the 1980s in Australia. It was the first Australian-made album to be released on Compact Disc within Australia. One of Farnham\\'s biggest hits, \"You\\'re the Voice\" was issued as the lead single from this album and peaked at No. 1 on the Kent Music Report Singles Charts.\\n\\nPrior to this album, Farnham\\'s career had stalled after being recruited and then leaving as lead singer of Australia\\'s Little River Band. Farnham\\'s manager, Glenn Wheatley, mortgaged his home to raise funds for the recording of this album. After initial reluctance by major Australian radio stations to play the lead single, \"You\\'re the Voice\", public demand became overwhelming and they relented. The song became one of the standout Number One songs on the Australian Charts of the 1980s and still remains a staple of Australian Radio. \"Whispering Jack\" restarted Farnham\\'s career and kept it rolling across two more decades. On 21 November 2006, \"Whispering Jack\" was re-released to celebrate its 20th Anniversary, which came with a bonus track, an extended studio version of \"Pressure Down\" and with a DVD of the edited 1987 \"Whispering Jack Live in Concert\" televised performance.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nJohn Farnham had been a teen pop idol during the late 1960s and 1970s billed then as \"Johnny\". He met Glenn Wheatley, who was bass guitarist of rock group The Masters Apprentices, when both acts were managed by Darryl Sambell. From the mid-1970s, Farnham had moved into television, stage and cabaret entertainment. Wheatley, who was already managing Little River Band (LRB), signed Farnham to his company in 1980. They decided Farnham\\'s comeback single would be a reworking of The Beatles\\' \"Help!\", which was produced by LRB\\'s Graeham Goble, it peaked at No. 8 on the Australian Kent Music Report Singles Chart. Farnham was utilising a more adult contemporary pop style and the associated album, \"Uncovered\", was also produced by Goble, which peaked at No. 20 on the Kent Music Report Album Charts. The B-side of \"Help\" was Farnham\\'s song writing effort, \"Jillie\\'s Song\", co-written with Goble. In recording the album, Farnham\\'s studio band included guitarist Tommy Emmanuel (ex-Southern Star Band), keyboardist Mal Logan (ex-Renée Geyer Band, LRB), drummer Derek Pellicci (LRB) and bass guitarist Barry Sullivan (ex-Chain). They became his tour band until Logan and Pellicci returned to their LRB commitments and were replaced by Sam McNally and David Jones respectively. Three other solo singles followed in 1981 but none charted into the Top 50. In February 1982, after Glenn Shorrock had departed Little River Band, Farnham became their lead vocalist with recommendations by Goble and Wheatley.\\n\\nIn 1985, Farnham had started collecting a songlist for a future solo album while still in Little River Band, he finished his vocals for their album, \"No Reins\", and left the band late that year. Farnham\\'s first solo performances since 1981 were live shows with the John Farnham Band consisting of Brett Garsed on lead guitar, Sam See on guitar and Derek Pellicci, formerly of Little River Band, on drums. In early 1986, sound engineer Ross Fraser suggested to Wheatley that it was time to start working on the solo album. Wheatley searched vainly for a producer and record label willing to work with Farnham, Fraser took on the producer role and Wheatley provided financial support after mortgaging his house.\\n\\nWhilst visiting a jazz club in the US, Farnham was mistakenly introduced as Jack Phantom, and when he subsequently provided a running commentary for a local pool game he named himself Whispering Jack Phantom after the \"Pot Black\" commentator \\'Whispering\\' Ted Lowe. Farnham\\'s work for the album, \"Whispering Jack\", included expanding his song list with Fraser\\'s advice. \"A Touch of Paradise\" was co-written by Gulliver Smith of Company Caine and Mondo Rock\\'s Ross Wilson, while \"Pressure Down\" was provided by Harry Bogdanovs. Two weeks before the album was due to be recorded a demo tape arrived from London with similar material to \"Pressure Down\", Farnham and Fraser listened to the demo of \"You\\'re the Voice\" and knew they had found a once-in-a-lifetime song. Another song on offer was \"We Built This City\" but Farnham knocked it back, it was later recorded by US band Starship.\\n\\nInitially, public interest in the re-branded former teen-idol was difficult to cultivate, and radio stations refused to play Farnham\\'s album. Things however started to change after Sydney radio station 2Day FM played its first single, \"You\\'re the Voice\", which was released in September 1986. Henceforth, radio stations began receiving requests for the song. Its television debut was on \"Hey Hey Its Saturday\" with Skyhook\\'s Greg Macainsh providing bass guitar. \"You\\'re the Voice,\" peaked at No. 1 in Sweden and Australia, as well as being a Top Ten hit in some European countries: No. 3 in Switzerland, No. 6 in the UK, and No. 6 in Austria. The song was written by Andy Qunta (ex-Icehouse), Keith Reid (Procol Harum), Maggie Ryder and Chris Thompson (ex-Manfred Mann\\'s Earth Band).\\n\\n\"Whispering Jack\", released in October, became the highest-selling album by an Australian act in Australia, and peaked at No. 1 on the Australian Kent Music Report Album Charts for a total of 25 weeks. As of 2006, it was 24x platinum indicating sales of over 1.68 million units in Australia alone. The album was released internationally on RCA/BMG and peaked at No. 1 in Sweden, No. 3 in Austria, and Top 20 in Norway. In August 1988 it returned to the Australian Top Ten. Other Australian singles were December\\'s \"Pressure Down\", which peaked at No. 4, February 1987\\'s \"Touch of Paradise\" and September\\'s \"Reasons\".\\n\\nFarnham followed with Jack\\'s Back Tour, an initial itinerary of eleven performances was thought to be enough considering they were up against tours by Michael Jackson and Billy Joel, but after high ticket sales, it was extended by eight more shows and use of larger venues. At that time, Jack\\'s Back Tour was the highest-grossing tour by an Australian act. John Farnham Band now consisted of Garsed on lead guitar, David Hirschfelder on keyboards (ex-Little River Band), Macainsh on bass and Angus Burchill on drums. Farnham won six of the inaugural 1987 Australian Record Industry Association (ARIA) Awards for \\'Album of the Year\\', \\'Single of the Year\\', \\'Highest Selling Album\\', \\'Highest Selling Single\\', \\'Best Male Artist\\' and \\'Best Adult Contemporary Album\\'. On 19 July 1987, TV series \"Countdown\" broadcast its last show, the 1986 with Farnham winning the \\'Best Album Award\\' for \"Whispering Jack\". In October 2010, \"Whispering Jack\" (1986) was listed in the book, \"100 Best Australian Albums\".\\n\\nIn 2011 Farnham announced a national tour to celebrate the 25th anniversary of \"Whispering Jack\", including the album being performed in its entirety in track order.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Whispering Jack Live.\\nFollowing the initial success of the album, a series of concerts was performed around Australia in 1987. One such performance was recorded at the Melbourne Sports and Entertainment Centre, and broadcast on Network Ten. A full version of the concert was also released to video in the same year.\\n\\nSection::::20th Anniversary Edition Track listing.\\nDisc One (CD)\\nDisc Two (\"Whispering Jack Live in Concert\" DVD) (NOTE: The DVD used the edited version originally broadcast on television in 1987.)\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Whispering Jack', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11279707'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11279990', 'text': 'RAF Weston Zoyland\\n\\nRAF Westonzoyland is one of the country\\'s oldest airfields being established in the early 1920s. Somerset, England. The airfield is located approximately east-southeast of Bridgwater; about west-southwest of London\\n\\nEstablished in 1925 with summer camps which would last from May until September each year, it was used by both the Royal Air Force and United States Army Air Forces. During the war it was used primarily as an army co-operation airfield but several squadrons were based there with a variety of aircraft. Spitfires, Hurricanes and Mosquito\\'s. Briefly - the early Meteor jets were based before flying off to RAF CULMHEAD in East Devon. There after they were based at RAF MANSTON with the mission of shooting down the V1 rockets. After being stood down in 1947 it was recommissioned in 1952 as a Meteor jet training base as a result of the Korean War. It was home to 209 AFS where Lord Craig and Sir Patrick Hine were based before going to become Air Chief Marshals of the RAF.\\n\\nToday the remains of the airfield are a mixture of farmland and a base for Civil Air Patrol activities.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nWestonzoyland airfield originated in the mid-1920s as a landing ground, being in use by 1926 for drogue tugs using the anti-aircraft gunnery range off Watchet in the Bristol Channel. At first, it was no more than an extended cow pasture, subject only to seasonal use until the Second World War loomed, when the site was occupied on a permanent basis. During the pre-war years, buildings were erected piecemeal as required and the landing ground area gradually enlarged but, with the fall of France, Westonzoyland was no longer a backwater airfield.\\n\\nTo obtain the necessary amount of land for siting runways of sufficient length, the A372 to Othery was closed and diverted south on a former minor road.\\n\\nIn 1942, the Air Ministry decided to upgrade the airfield to bomber standard and, early in 1943, work began on laying concrete runways and the perimeter track to the Class A airfield standard, the main feature of which was a set of three converging runways each containing a concrete runway for takeoffs and landings, optimally placed at 60 degree angles to each other in a triangular pattern.\\n\\nThe airfield runways were a main of 5.775\\xa0ft at 11/29, and ancillaries of 3,564\\xa0ft at 05/23 and 4,101\\xa0ft at 16/34. Two hardstands were of 150\\xa0ft diameter pans and there were 33 loops connecting to an enclosing perimeter track, of a standard width of 50 feet.\\n\\nSection::::USAAF use.\\nWestonzoyland was known as USAAF Station AAF-447 for security reasons during the war while under American control, and by which it was referred to instead of location. Its Station-ID was \"ZW\".\\n\\nSection::::442nd Troop Carrier Group.\\nThere was a long delay before the allocated unit, the 442d Troop Carrier Group arrived after D-Day from RAF Fulbeck. Its operational squadrons were:\\n\\nThe 442d was a group of Ninth Air Force\\'s 50th Troop Carrier Wing, IX Troop Carrier Command. The group moved in October 1944 to its Advanced Landing Ground (ALG) Peray Airfield (ALG A-44) France.\\n\\nSection::::Subsequent RAF use.\\nThe station had never been officially transferred from the RAF and the anti-aircraft support units were quick to return. Several Squadrons were based at Westonzoyland, but the longest stay was by No. 16 Squadron RAF who flew Westland Lysanders, and later with the North American Mustang. Later Supermarine Spitfires became a common sight being flown by No. 19 Squadron RAF and others. Nos. 286 and 587 Squadrons with their mixture of Miles Martinets, Hawker Hurricanes, Airspeed Oxfords, Vultee A-31 Vengeances and North American Harvards remained in residence until near the end of hostilities. 587 Squadron was formed at RAF Westonzoyland, on 1 December 1943, from 1600 Flight, 1601 Flight and 1625 Flight for anti-aircraft co-operation duties over Wales and the south east of England. It operated a variety of aircraft in this role. Due to the ongoing training requirement the squadron was not disbanded at the end of the war and it moved to RAF Tangmere on 1 June 1946 to cover the south coast, but was disbanded shortly afterwards on 15 June 1946.\\n\\nFour fighter squadrons came and departed during the months following the end of the war in Europe, but by 1947 the station was reduced to care and maintenance.\\n\\nThere was virtually no further flying at Westonzoyland until the summer of 1952 when, to meet the Soviet threat, an increase in the RAF\\'s strength and a demand for more aircrews found Meteors and Vampires operating in a training role.\\n\\nEnglish Electric Canberra squadrons were present during the mid-1950s when Westonzoyland was used as a work-up station prior to overseas assignments. By 1958 the station was once more deserted of aircraft and, although retained by the Air Ministry for another ten years, it never reopened for military flying. Some of these Canberras flew out to Australia to take part in the British atomic tests at Maralinga.\\n\\nSection::::Current use.\\nUpon its release from military use, in the 1960s, the A372 was restored to near its original route by utilising a considerable length of the former main runway. The former secondary runways are clearly evident in aerial photography, although most of the concrete has been removed. The former perimeter track has been reduced to a single-lane agricultural road with the pan and loop dispersal hardstands all being removed. Several derelict buildings still remain, including the control tower and a large cluster to the northwest of the perimeter, including the base of what appears to be the remains of two large J-Type hangars and a support site. No evidence of the Pierced Steel Planking extensions to the runways remain nor of an ammunition dump.\\n\\nIn the late 1960s, local people used the station\\'s squash courts.\\n\\nAlthough much of the airfield is no longer usable for aviation purposes, Westonzoyland Airfield is in use for Microlights which uses the northwest half of the 16/34 runway, and is a base for the Sky Watch Civil Air Patrol (SWCAP).\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'RAF Weston Zoyland', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11279990'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'xxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11280395', 'text': 'List of Spanish films before 1930\\n\\nA list of the earliest films produced in the Cinema of Spain, ordered by year of release from 1897 to 1929.

The most popular ad blocking tools are browser extensions. Other methods are also available.\\n\\nSection::::Technologies and native countermeasures.\\nOnline advertising exists in a variety of forms, including web banners, pictures, animations, embedded audio and video, text, or pop-up windows, and can employ audio and video autoplay. All browsers offer some ways to remove or alter advertisements: either by targeting technologies that are used to deliver ads (such as embedded content delivered through browser plug-ins or via HTML5), targeting URLs that are the source of ads, or targeting behaviors characteristic to ads (such as the use of HTML5 autoplay of both audio and video).\\n\\nSection::::Reasons for blocking ads.\\nFrom the standpoint of an Internet user, there are various fundamental reasons why one would want to use ad blocking, in addition to not being manipulated by brands: \\nPublishers and their representative trade bodies, on the other hand, argue that web ads provide revenue to website owners, which enable the website owners to create or otherwise purchase content for the website. Publishers claim that the prevalent use of ad blocking software and devices could adversely affect website owner revenue and thus in turn lower the availability of free content on websites.\\n\\nSection::::Benefits.\\nFor users, the benefits of ad blocking software include quicker loading and cleaner looking web pages with fewer distractions, lower resource waste (bandwidth, CPU, memory, etc.), and privacy benefits gained through the exclusion of the tracking and profiling systems of ad delivery platforms. Blocking ads can also save substantial amounts of electrical energy and lower users\\' power bills.\\n\\nSection::::User experience.\\nAd blocking software may have other benefits to users\\' quality of life, as it decreases Internet users\\' exposure to advertising and marketing industries, which promote the purchase of numerous consumer products and services that are potentially harmful or unhealthy and on creating the urge to buy immediately.\\n\\nUnwanted advertising can also harm the advertisers themselves if users become annoyed by the ads. Irritated users might make a conscious effort to avoid the goods and services of firms which are using annoying \"pop-up\" ads which block the Web content the user is trying to view. For users not interested in making purchases, the blocking of ads can also save time. Any ad that appears on a website exerts a toll on the user\\'s \"attention budget\", since each ad enters the user\\'s field of view and must either be consciously ignored or closed, or dealt with in some other way. A user who is strongly focused on reading solely the content that they are seeking, likely has no desire to be diverted by advertisements that seek to sell unneeded or unwanted goods and services. In contrast, users who are actively seeking items to purchase, might appreciate advertising, in particular targeted ads.\\n\\nSection::::Security.\\nAnother important aspect is improving security; online advertising subjects users to a higher risk of infecting their devices with computer viruses than surfing pornography websites. In a high-profile case, malware was distributed through advertisements provided to YouTube by a malicious customer of Google\\'s Doubleclick. In August 2015, a 0-day exploit in the Firefox browser was discovered in an advertisement on a website. When Forbes required users to disable ad blocking before viewing their website, those users were immediately served with pop-under malware. The Australian Signals Directorate recommends individuals and organizations block advertisements to improve their information security posture and mitigate potential malvertising attacks and machine compromise. The information security firm Webroot also note employing ad blockers provide effective countermeasures against malvertising campaigns for less technically-sophisticated computer users.\\n\\nSection::::Monetary.\\nAd blocking can also save money for the user. If a user\\'s personal time is worth one dollar per minute, and if unsolicited advertising adds an extra minute to the time that the user requires for reading the webpage (i.e. the user must manually identify the ads as ads, and then click to close them, or use other techniques to either deal with them, all of which tax the user\\'s intellectual focus in some way), then the user has effectively lost one dollar of time in order to deal with ads that might generate a few fractional pennies of display-ad revenue for the website owner. The problem of lost time can rapidly spiral out of control if malware accompanies the ads.\\n\\nAd blocking also reduces page load time and saves bandwidth for the users. Users who pay for total transferred bandwidth (\"capped\" or pay-for-usage connections) including most mobile users worldwide, have a direct financial benefit from filtering an ad before it is loaded. Analysis of the 200 most popular news sites (as ranked by Alexa) in 2015 showed that Mozilla Firefox Tracking Protection lead to 39% reduction in data usage and 44% median reduction in page load time. According to research performed by The New York Times, ad blockers reduced data consumption and sped up load time by more than half on 50 news sites, including their own. Journalists concluded that \"visiting the home page of Boston.com (the site with most ad data in the study) every day for a month would cost the equivalent of about $9.50 in data usage just for the ads\". Streaming audio and video, even if they are not presented to the user interface, can rapidly consume gigabytes of transfer especially on a faster 4G connection. Even fixed connections are often subject to usage limits, especially the faster connections (100Mbit/s and up) which can quickly saturate a network if filled by streaming media. It is a known problem with most web browsers, including Firefox, that restoring sessions often plays multiple embedded ads at once.\\n\\nSection::::Popularity.\\nUse of mobile and desktop ad blocking software designed to remove traditional advertising grew by 41% worldwide and by 48% in the U.S. between Q2 2014 and Q2 2015. As of Q2 2015, 45 million Americans were using ad blockers. In a survey research study released Q2 2016, MetaFacts reported 72 million Americans, 12.8 million adults in the UK, and 13.2 million adults in France were using ad blockers on their PCs, smartphones, or tablet computers. In March 2016, the Internet Advertising Bureau reported that UK adblocking was already at 22% among people over 18 years old.\\n\\nSection::::Methods.\\nOne method of filtering is simply to block (or prevent autoplay of) Flash animation or image loading or Microsoft Windows audio and video files. This can be done in most browsers easily and also improves security and privacy. This crude technological method is refined by numerous browser extensions. Every web browser handles this task differently, but, in general, one alters the options, preferences or application extensions to filter specific media types. An additional add-on is usually required to differentiate between ads and non-ads using the same technology, or between wanted and unwanted ads or behaviors.\\n\\nThe more advanced ad blocking filter software allow fine-grained control of advertisements through features such as blacklists, whitelists, and regular expression filters. Certain security features also have the effect of disabling some ads. Some antivirus software can act as an ad blocker. Filtering by intermediaries such as ISP providers or national governments is increasingly common.\\n\\nSection::::Browser integration.\\nAs of 2015, many web browsers block unsolicited pop-up ads automatically. Current versions of Konqueror and Internet Explorer also include content filtering support. Content filtering can be added to Firefox, Chromium-based browsers, Opera, Safari, and other browsers with extensions such as AdBlock, Adblock Plus, and uBlock Origin, and a number of sources provide regularly updated filter lists. Adblock Plus (provided by the German software house Eyeo GmbH) is included in the freeware browser Maxthon from the People\\'s Republic of China by default. Another method for filtering advertisements uses Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) rules to hide specific HTML and XHTML elements.\\n\\nAt the beginning of 2018, Google confirmed that the built-in ad blocker for the Chrome/Chromium browsers would go live on the 15th of February: this ad blocker only blocks certain ads as specified by the Better Ads Standard (defined by the Coalition for Better Ads®, in which Google itself is a board member). This built-in ad blocking mechanism is disputed because it could unfairly benefit Google\\'s advertising itself.\\n\\nSection::::External programs.\\nA number of external software applications offer ad filtering as a primary or additional feature. A traditional solution is to customize an HTTP proxy (or web proxy) to filter content. These programs work by caching and filtering content before it is displayed in a user\\'s browser. This provides an opportunity to remove not only ads but also content which may be offensive, inappropriate, or even malicious (Drive-by download). Popular proxy software which blocks content effectively include Netnanny, Privoxy, Squid, and some content-control software. The main advantage of the method is freedom from implementation limitations (browser, working techniques) and centralization of control (the proxy can be used by many users). Proxies are very good at filtering ads, but they have several limitations compared to browser-based solutions. For proxies, it is difficult to filter Transport Layer Security (SSL) (codice_1) traffic and full webpage context is not available to the filter. As well, proxies find it difficult to filter JavaScript-generated ad content.\\n\\nSection::::Hosts file and DNS manipulation.\\nMost operating systems, even those which are aware of the Domain Name System (DNS), still offer backward compatibility with a locally administered list of foreign hosts. This configuration, for historical reasons, is stored in a flat text file that by default contains very few hostnames and their associated IP addresses. Editing this hosts file is simple and effective because most DNS clients will read the local hosts file before querying a remote DNS server. Storing black-hole entries in the hosts file prevents the browser from accessing an ad server by manipulating the name resolution of the ad server to a local or nonexistent IP address (codice_2 or codice_3 are typically used for IPv4 addresses). While simple to implement, these methods can be circumvented by advertisers, either by hard-coding the IP address of the server that hosts the ads (this, in its turn, can be worked around by changing the local routing table by using for example iptables or other blocking firewalls), or by loading the advertisements from the same server that serves the main content; blocking name resolution of this server would also block the useful content of the site.\\n\\nUsing a DNS sinkhole by manipulating the hosts file exploits the fact that most operating systems store a file with IP address, domain name pairs which is consulted by most browsers before using a DNS server to look up a domain name. By assigning the loopback address to each known ad server, the user directs traffic intended to reach each ad server to the local machine or to a virtual black hole of /dev/null or bit bucket.\\n\\nSection::::DNS filtering.\\nAdvertising can be blocked by using a DNS server which is configured to block access to domains or hostnames which are known to serve ads by spoofing the address. Users can choose to use an already modified DNS server or set up a dedicated device such as a Raspberry Pi themselves. Manipulating DNS is a widely employed method to manipulate what the end user sees from the Internet but can also be deployed locally for personal purposes. China runs its own root DNS and the EU has considered the same. Google has required their Google Public DNS be used for some applications on its Android devices. Accordingly, DNS addresses / domains used for advertising may be extremely vulnerable to a broad form of ad substitution whereby a domain that serves ads is entirely swapped out with one serving more local ads to some subset of users. This is especially likely in countries, notably Russia, India and China, where advertisers often refuse to pay for clicks or page views. DNS-level blocking of domains for non-commercial reasons is already common in China.\\n\\nSection::::Recursive Local VPN.\\nOn Android, apps can run a local VPN connection with its own host filtering ability and DNS address without requiring root access. This approach allows adblocking app to download adblocking host files and use them to filter out ad networks throughout the device. Blokada, DNS66, AdGuard are few of the popular apps which accomplish adblocking without root permission. The adblocking is only active when the local VPN is turned on, and it completely stops when the VPN connection is disconnected. The convenience makes it easy to access content blocked by anti-adblock scripts.\\n\\nThis approach optimizes battery usage, reduces internet slowdown caused by using external DNS or VPN adblocking and needs overall less configuration.\\n\\nSection::::Hardware devices.\\nDevices such as AdTrap use hardware to block Internet advertising. Based on reviews of AdTrap, this device uses a Linux Kernel running a version of PrivProxy to block ads from video streaming, music streaming, and any web browser. Another such solution is provided for network-level ad blocking for telcos by Israeli startup Shine.\\n\\nSection::::By external parties and internet providers.\\nInternet providers, especially mobile operators, frequently offer proxies designed to reduce network traffic. Even when not targeted specifically at ad filtering, these proxy-based arrangements will block many types of advertisements that are too large or bandwidth-consuming, or that are otherwise deemed unsuited for the specific internet connection or target device. Many internet operators block some form of advertisements while at the same time injecting their own ads promoting their services and specials.\\n\\nSection::::Economic consequences for online business.\\nSome content providers have argued that widespread ad blocking results in decreased revenue to a website sustained by advertisements and e-commerce-based businesses, where this blocking can be detected. Some have argued that since advertisers are ultimately paying for ads to increase their own revenues, eliminating ad blocking would only dilute the value per impression and drive down the price of advertising, arguing that like click fraud, impressions served to users who use ad blockers are of little to no value to advertisers. Consequently, they argue, eliminating ad blocking would not increase overall ad revenue to content providers in the long run.\\n\\nSection::::Response from publishers.\\nSection::::Countermeasures.\\nSome websites have taken countermeasures against ad blocking software, such as attempting to detect the presence of ad blockers and informing users of their views, or outright preventing users from accessing the content unless they disable the ad blocking software, whitelist the website, or buy an \"ad-removal pass\". There have been several arguments supporting and opposing the assertion that blocking ads is wrong.\\n\\nSome publisher companies have taken steps to protect their rights to conduct their business according to prevailing law.\\nIt has been suggested that in the European Union, the practice of websites scanning for ad blocking software may run afoul of the E-Privacy Directive. This claim was further validated by IAB Europe\\'s guidelines released in June 2016 stating that there indeed may be a legal issue in ad blocker detection. While some anti-blocking stakeholders have tried to refute this it seems safe to assume that Publishers should follow the guidelines provided by the main Publisher lobby IAB. The joint effort announced by IAB Sweden prior to IAB Europe\\'s guideline on the matter never materialized, and would have most likely been found against European anti-competition laws if it did.\\n\\nIn August 2017, a vendor of such counter-measures issued a demand under section 1201 of the U.S. Digital Millennium Copyright Act, to demand the removal of a domain name associated with their service from an ad-blocking filter list. The vendor argued that the domain constituted a component of a technological protection measure designed to protect a copyrighted work, and thus made it a violation of anti-circumvention law to frustrate access to it.\\n\\nSection::::Alternatives.\\nAs of 2015, advertisers and marketers look to involve their brands directly into the entertainment with native advertising and product placement (also known as brand integration or embedded marketing). An example of product placement would be for a soft drink manufacturer to pay a reality TV show producer to have the show\\'s cast and host appear onscreen holding cans of the soft drink. Another common product placement is for an automotive manufacturer to give free cars to the producers of a TV show, in return for the show\\'s producer depicting characters using these vehicles during the show.\\n\\nSome digital publications turned to their customers for help. For example, the Guardian is asking its readers for donations to help offset falling advertising revenue. According to the newspaper\\'s editor-in-chief, Katharine Viner, the newspaper gets about the same amount of money from membership and paying readers as it does from advertising. The newspaper considered preventing readers from accessing its content if usage of ad-blocking software becomes widespread, but so far it keeps the content accessible for readers who employ ad-blockers.\\n', 'title': 'Ad blocking', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129601'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '0xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1129627', 'text': 'Gremlin Interactive\\n\\nInfogrames Studios Limited (formerly Gremlin Graphics Software Limited and later Gremlin Interactive Limited) was a British software house based in Sheffield, working mostly in the home computer market.

The decree found a broad response among the workers of the country, though they often had to fight resistance from their factories, which needed them to fill production quotas. In her history of the movement, Lynne Viola writes:\\nThe recruitment drive illustrated the sometimes contradictory nature of the first five-year plan revolution, which aimed for the maximum in economic modernization while at the same time insisting that modernization occur within the parameters of the social and political guidelines of the proletarian dictatorship. The factories were required to increase production while releasing their best workers for participation in the numerous mobilizations of skilled workers for promotion in the bureaucracy, the purge of the state administration, enrollment in higher technical education, and work in the countryside. The consequences of these contradictory demands were frequently inconsistency, disorder, and an uneasy balance between different institutional concerns, revealing a side of Soviet politics lacking unity of purpose and divided by differing interests. In the recruitment of the 25,000ers this meant that ultimately the state had to circumvent factory officialdom and, with the aid of the party organs, appeal directly to workers over the head of resistant factory officials for support in the campaign. And the result was that, in spite of the opposition of factory officials and problems in campaign implementation, the recruitment drive was an enormous success.\\nAs a result, 27,519 people were selected from all over the USSR and sent to work in the kolkhozy.\\n\\nAnalysis of the social structure of 23,409 twenty-five-thousanders who had personal files reveals:\\n\\n\\nIn order to prepare the twenty-five-thousanders for work in the rural areas, the Soviets organized special courses. Some volunteers were sent to sovkhozy for two or three months as interns. Most of the twenty-five-thousanders were sent directly to kolkhozy in the principal cereal regions of the country, such as Ukraine, North Caucasus, Lower and Middle Volga, the Black Earth Region and others.\\n\\nThe twenty-five-thousanders took part in establishing new kolkhozy and in strengthening the weak ones, conducting political, educational and cultural work among the inhabitants of the rural areas. They assisted kolkhozy in organizing stock, strengthening work-discipline and establishing \"correct\" product-distribution. Some of the twenty-five-thousanders were elected board members and chairmen of kolkhozy.\\n\\nHowever, the twenty-five-thousanders encountered fierce resistance from the so-called kulaks, who opposed the socialist re-organization of agriculture.\\n\\nSoviet literature treated the phenomenon of the twenty-five-thousanders extensively.

This syndrome can be classed as one of various hereditary intestinal polyposis syndromes and one of various hamartomatous polyposis syndromes. It has an incidence of approximately 1 in 25,000 to 300,000 births.\\n\\nSection::::Signs and symptoms.\\nThe risks associated with this syndrome include a strong tendency of developing cancer in a number of parts of the body. While the hamartomatous polyps themselves only have a small malignant potential (<3% - OHCM), patients with the syndrome have an increased risk of developing carcinomas of the liver, lungs, breast, ovaries, uterus, testes and other organs. Specifically, it is associated with an increased risk of sex-cord stromal tumor with annular tubules in the ovaries.\\n\\nThe average age of first diagnosis is 23, but the lesions can be identified at birth by an astute pediatrician or family physician. Prior to puberty, the mucocutaneous lesions can be found on the palms and soles. Often the first presentation is a bowel obstruction from an intussusception which is a common cause of mortality; an intussusception is a telescoping of one loop of bowel into another segment.\\n\\nSection::::Pathophysiology.\\nSection::::Genetics.\\nIn 1998, a gene was found to be associated with the mutation. On chromosome 19, the gene known as \"STK11\" (\"LKB1\") is a possible tumor suppressor gene. It is inherited in an autosomal dominant pattern, which means that anyone who has PJS has a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their offspring.\\n\\nPeutz–Jeghers syndrome is rare and studies typically include only a small number of patients. Even in those few studies that do contain a large number of patients, the quality of the evidence is limited due to pooling patients from many centers, selection bias (only patients with health problems coming from treatment are included), and historical bias (the patients reported are from a time before advances in the diagnosis of treatment of Peutz–Jeghers syndrome were made). Probably due to this limited evidence base, cancer risk estimates for Peutz–Jeghers syndrome vary from study to study. There is an estimated 18-21% risk of ovarian cancer, 9% risk of endometrial cancer, and 10% risk of cervical cancer, specifically adenoma malignum.\\n\\nSection::::Diagnosis.\\nThe main criteria for clinical diagnosis are:\\n\\nHaving 2 of the 3 listed clinical criteria indicates a positive diagnosis. The oral findings are consistent with other conditions, such as Addison\\'s disease and McCune-Albright syndrome, and these should be included in the differential diagnosis. 90–100% of patients with a clinical diagnosis of PJS have a mutation in the \"STK11/LKB1\" gene. Molecular genetic testing for this mutation is available clinically.\\n\\nSection::::Management.\\nResection of the polyps is required only if serious bleeding or intussusception occurs. Enterotomy is performed for removing large, single nodules. Short lengths of heavily involved intestinal segments can be resected. Colonoscopy can be used to snare the polyps if they are within reach.\\n\\nSection::::Prognosis.\\nMost patients will develop flat, brownish spots (melanotic macules) on the skin, especially on the lips and oral mucosa, during the first year of life, and a patient\\'s first bowel obstruction due to intussusception usually occurs between the ages of six and 18 years. The cumulative lifetime cancer risk begins to rise in middle age. Cumulative risks by age 70 for all cancers, gastrointestinal (GI) cancers, and pancreatic cancer are 85%, 57%, and 11%, respectively.\\n\\nA 2011 Dutch study followed 133 patients for 14 years. The cumulative risk for cancer was 40% and 76% at ages 40 and 70, respectively. 42 (32%) of the patients died during the study, of which 28 (67%) were cancer related. They died at a median age of 45. Mortality was increased compared with the general population.\\n\\nA family with sinonasal polyposis were followed up for 28 years. Two cases of sinonasal type adenocarcinoma developed. This is a rare cancer. This report suggested that follow up of sinus polyps in this syndrome may be indicated.\\n\\nSection::::Monitoring.\\nSome suggestions for surveillance for cancer include the following:\\n\\nFollow-up care should be supervised by a physician familiar with Peutz–Jeghers syndrome. Genetic consultation and counseling as well as urological and gynecological consultations are often needed.\\n\\nSection::::Eponym.\\nFirst described in a published case report in 1921 by Jan Peutz (1886-1957), a Dutch Internist, it was later formalized into the syndrome by American physicians at Boston City Hospital, Harold Joseph Jeghers (1904-1990) and Kermit Harry Katz (1914-2003), and Victor Almon McKusick (1921-2008) in 1949 and published in the New England Journal of Medicine.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Peutz–Jeghers syndrome', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1129862'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '1xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11299290', 'text': 'Schisler\\n\\nSchisler is a surname.

It was largely a continuation of the First Sudanese Civil War of 1955 to 1972. Although it originated in southern Sudan, the civil war spread to the Nuba mountains and the Blue Nile. It lasted for 22 years and is one of the longest civil wars on record. The war resulted in the independence of South Sudan six years after the war ended.\\n\\nRoughly two million people died as a result of war, famine and disease caused by the conflict. Four million people in southern Sudan were displaced at least once (and normally repeatedly) during the war. The civilian death toll is one of the highest of any war since World War II and was marked by a large number of human rights violations. These include slavery and mass killings.\\n\\nSection::::Background and Causes.\\nThe Sudanese war is often characterized as a fight between the central government expanding and dominating peoples of the periphery, raising allegations of marginalization. Kingdoms and great powers based along the Nile River have fought against the people of inland Sudan for centuries. Since at least the 18th century, central governments have attempted to regulate and exploit the undeveloped southern and inland Sudan.\\n\\nSome sources describe the conflict as an ethnoreligious one where the Muslim central government\\'s pursuits to impose sharia law on non-Muslim southerners led to violence, and eventually to the civil war. Douglas Johnson has pointed to an exploitative governance as the root cause.\\n\\nWhen the British governed Sudan as a colony they administered the northern and southern provinces separately. The south was held to be more similar to the other east-African colonies — Kenya, Tanganyika, and Uganda — while northern Sudan was more similar to Arabic-speaking Egypt. Northern Arabs were prevented from holding positions of power in the south with its African traditions, and trade was discouraged between the two areas. However, in 1946, the British gave in to northern pressure to integrate the two areas. Arabic was made the language of administration in the south, and northerners began to hold positions there. The southern elite, trained in English, resented the change as they were kept out of their own government. After decolonization most power was given to the northern elites based in Khartoum, causing unrest in the south. The British moved towards granting Sudan independence, but they failed to give enough power to Southern leaders. Southern Sudanese leaders weren\\'t even invited to negotiations during the transitional period in the 1950s. In the post-colonial government of 1953, the Sudanization Committee only included 6 southern leaders, though there were some 800 available senior administrative positions.\\n\\nThe second war was partially about natural resources. Between the north and the south lie significant oil fields and thus significant foreign interests (the oil revenue is privatized to Western interests as in Nigeria). The north wanted to control these resources because they are situated on the edge of the Sahara desert, which is unsuitable for agricultural development. Oil revenues make up about 70% of Sudan\\'s export earnings, and contribute to the development of the country which, unlike the south, does not depend on international aid. Due to numerous tributaries of the Nile river and heavier precipitation in the south of Sudan they have superior water access and fertile land.\\n\\nThere has also been a significant amount of death from warring tribes in the south. Most of the conflict has been between Nuer and Dinka but other ethnic groups have also been involved. These tribal conflicts have remained after independence. For example, in January 2012 3,000 Murle people were massacred by the Nuer.\\n\\nThe first civil war ended in 1972, with the Addis Ababa Agreement. Part of the agreement gave religious and cultural autonomy to the south.\\n\\nSection::::Civil War.\\nSection::::Before 1985.\\nSection::::Addis Ababa Agreement ended.\\nThe Addis Ababa Accords were incorporated in the Constitution of Sudan; the violation of the agreement led to the second civil war.\\n\\nThe first violations occurred when President Jaafar Nimeiry attempted to take control of oil fields straddling the north-south border. Oil had been discovered in Bentiu in 1978, in southern Kurdufan and Upper Blue Nile in 1979, the Unity oilfields in 1980 and Adar oilfields in 1981, and in Heglig in 1982. Access to the oil fields meant significant economic benefit to whoever controlled them.\\n\\nIslamic fundamentalists in the north had been discontented with the Addis Ababa Agreement, which gave relative autonomy to the non-Islamic majority Southern Sudan Autonomous Region. The fundamentalists continued to grow in power, and in 1983 President Nimeiry declared all Sudan an Islamic state, terminating the Southern Sudan Autonomous Region.\\n\\nSection::::Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA).\\nThe Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) was founded in 1983 as a rebel group, to reestablish an autonomous Southern Sudan by fighting against the central government. While based in Southern Sudan, it identified itself as a movement for all oppressed Sudanese citizens, and was led by John Garang. Initially, the SPLA campaigned for a United Sudan, criticizing the central government for policies that were leading to national \"disintegration\".\\n\\nIn September 1985 announced the end of the state of emergency and dismantled the emergency courts but soon promulgated a new judiciary act, which continued many of the practices of the emergency courts. Despite Nimeiry\\'s public assurances that the rights of non-Muslims would be respected, southerners and other non-Muslims remained deeply suspicious.\\n\\nSection::::1985–1991.\\nOn 6 April 1985, senior military officers led by Gen. Abdul Rahman Suwar ad-Dahhab mounted a coup. Among the first acts of the new government was to suspend the 1983 constitution, rescind the decree declaring Sudan\\'s intent to become an Islamic state, and disband Nimeiry\\'s Sudan Socialist Union. However, the \"September laws\" instituting Islamic Sharia law were not suspended.\\n\\nA 15-member transitional military council was named, chaired by Gen. Suwar ad-Dahhab, in 1985. In consultation with an informal conference of political parties, unions, and professional organizations—known as the \"Gathering\"—the military council appointed an interim civilian cabinet, headed by Prime Minister Dr. Al-Jazuli Daf\\'allah. Elections were held in April 1986, and a transitional military council turned over power to a civilian government as promised. The government was headed by Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi of the Umma Party. It consisted of a coalition of the Umma Party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) (formerly the NUP-National Unionist Party), the National Islamic Front (NIF) of Hassan al-Turabi, and several southern region parties. This coalition dissolved and reformed several times over the next few years, with Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi and his Umma Party always in a central role.\\n\\nSection::::Negotiation and escalation.\\nIn May 1986, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government coalition began peace negotiations with the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) led by Col. John Garang. In that year the SPLA and a number of Sudanese political parties met in Ethiopia and agreed to the \"Koka Dam\" declaration, which called for abolishing Islamic Sharia law and convening a constitutional conference. In 1988, the SPLA and the DUP agreed on a peace plan calling for the abolition of military pacts with Egypt and Libya, freezing of Sharia law, an end to the state of emergency, and a cease-fire. However, during this period the second civil war intensified in lethality, and the national economy continued to deteriorate. When prices of basic goods were increased in 1988, riots ensued, and the price increases were cancelled. When Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi refused to approve a peace plan reached by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and the Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) in November 1988, the DUP left the government. The new government consisted essentially of the Umma Party and the fundamentalist National Islamic Front (NIF).\\nIn February 1989, the army presented Prime Minister Sadiq al-Mahdi with an ultimatum: he could move toward peace or be removed. He chose to form a new government with the DUP, and approved the SPLA/DUP peace plan. A constitutional conference was tentatively planned for September 1989.\\n\\nSection::::Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation.\\nOn 30 June 1989, however, military officers under then Col. Omar Hassan al-Bashir, with National Islamic Front (NIF) instigation and support, replaced the Sadiq al-Mahdi government with the Revolutionary Command Council for National Salvation (RCC), a military junta of 15 military officers (reduced to 12 in 1991) assisted by a civilian cabinet. As General al-Bashir he became: president; chief of state; prime minister; and chief of the armed forces.\\n\\nThe RCC al-Bashir military government banned trade unions, political parties, and other \"non-religious\" institutions. About 78,000 members of the army, police, and civil administration were purged in order to reshape the government.\\n\\nSection::::Criminal Act of 1991.\\nIn March 1991, a new penal code, the Criminal Act of 1991, instituted harsh punishments nationwide, including amputations and stoning. Although the southern states were officially exempt from these Islamic prohibitions and penalties, the 1991 act provided for a possible future application of Islamic Shari’a law in the south. In 1993, the government transferred most non-Muslim judges from the south to the north, replacing them with Muslim judges in the south. The introduction of Public Order Police to enforce Shari’a law resulted in the arrest, and treatment under Shari’a penalties, of southerners and other non-Muslims living in the north.\\n\\nSection::::Conduct of the war: 1991–2001.\\nThe Sudan People\\'s Liberation Army (SPLA) was in control of large areas of Equatoria, Bahr al Ghazal, and Upper Nile provinces and also operated in the southern portions of Darfur, Kordofan, and Blue Nile provinces. The government controlled a number of the major southern towns and cities, including Juba, Wau, and Malakal. An informal cease-fire in May broke down in October 1989.\\n\\nIn July 1992, a government offensive seized southern Sudan, and captured the SPLA headquarters in Torit.\\n\\nBoth the government regular armed forces and notorious militia (known as the People\\'s Defense Forces, PDF) were used to attack and raid villages in the South and the Nuba Mountains. Sudan’s national governments have a long history of using proxies in Southern Sudan, and the North–South border areas, to fight their wars and preserve their regular forces. These militias were recruited locally, and with covert ties to the national government. Many of the Khartoum-aligned groups were created and then armed by the NIF in a deliberate ‘divide and rule’ strategy.\\n\\nSection::::SPLA dissension.\\nIn August 1991, internal dissension among the rebels led opponents of Colonel Garang\\'s leadership of the SPLA to form the so-called Nasir faction of the SPLA rebel army. The attempt to overthrow Garang was led by Riek Machar and Lam Akol. In November 1991, SPLA-Nasir carried out the Bor massacre, killing an estimated 2000 civilians. In September 1992, William Nyuon Bany formed a second rebel faction, and in February 1993, Kerubino Kwanyin Bol formed a third rebel faction. On 5 April 1993, the three dissident rebel factions announced a coalition of their groups called SPLA United at a press conference in Nairobi, Kenya.\\n\\nSection::::Sudanese alignments.\\nIn 1990–91, the Sudanese government supported Saddam Hussein in the Gulf War. This changed American attitudes toward the country. Bill Clinton\\'s administration prohibited American investment in the country and supplied money to neighbouring countries to repel Sudanese incursions. The US also began attempts to \"isolate\" Sudan and began referring to it as a rogue state.\\n\\nSince 1993, the leaders of Eritrea, Ethiopia, Uganda, and Kenya have pursued a peace initiative for Sudan under the auspices of the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD), but results have been mixed. Despite that record, the IGAD initiative promulgated the 1994 Declaration of Principles (DOP) that aimed to identify the essential elements necessary to a just and comprehensive peace settlement; i.e., the relationship between religion and the state, power-sharing, wealth-sharing, and the right of self-determination for the south. The Sudanese Government did not sign the DOP until 1997 after major battlefield losses to the SPLA.\\n\\nSection::::SPLA alignments.\\nIn 1995, the opposition in the north united with parties from the south to create a coalition of opposition parties called the National Democratic Alliance. This development opened a northeastern front to the civil war, making it more than before a center-periphery rather than simply a north-south conflict. The SPLA, DUP, and Umma Parties were the key groups forming the NDA, along with several smaller parties and northern ethnic groups.\\n\\nIn 1995, Eritrea, Ethiopia and Uganda stepped up their military assistance to the SPLA to the point of sending active troops into Sudan. Eritrean and Ethiopian military involvement weakened when the two countries entered a border conflict in 1998. Uganda\\'s support weakened when it shifted its attention to the conflict in the Democratic Republic of Congo.\\n\\nBy 1997, seven groups in the government camp, led by former Garang lieutenant Riek Machar, signed the Khartoum Peace Agreement with the NIF, thereby forming the largely symbolic South Sudan Defence Forces (SSDF) umbrella. Furthermore, the government signed the Nuba Mountains, and Fashoda agreements with rebel factions. These included the Khartoum agreements that ended military conflict between the government and significant rebel factions. Many of those leaders then moved to Khartoum where they assumed marginal roles in the central government, or collaborated with the government in military engagements against the SPLA. These three agreements paralleled the terms and conditions of the IGAD agreement, calling for a degree of autonomy for the south and the right of self-determination. Nevertheless, the SPLA made major advances in 1997 due to the success of Operation Thunderbolt, an offensive during which the South Sudanese separatists seized most of Central and Western Equatoria from the government.\\n\\nIn July 2000, the Libyan/Egyptian Joint Initiative on the Sudan was made moot, calling for the establishment of an interim government, power-sharing, constitutional reform, and new elections. Southern critics objected to the joint initiative because it neglected to address issues of the relationship between religion and the state and failed to mention the right of shelf-determination. It is unclear to what extent this initiative will have a significant impact on the search for peace, as some critics view it as more aimed at a resolution among northern political parties and protecting the perceived security interests of Egypt in favour of the unity of the Sudan.\\n\\nSection::::Peace agreement.\\nPeace talks between the southern rebels and the government made substantial progress in 2003 and early 2004, although skirmishes in parts of the south continued. A Comprehensive Peace Agreement was signed on 9 January 2005 in Nairobi.\\n\\n\\nThe status of three central and eastern provinces was a point of contention in the negotiations.\\n\\nSection::::Foreign interventions.\\nIn 1999, Egypt and Libya initiated the Egypt-Libya Initiative (ELI). By this time the peace process of the Inter-Governmental Authority on Drought and Development (IGADD) had reached a stalemate. ELI\\'s main purpose had been to bring members of the non-Southern opposition (especially opposition in the north) aboard the talks. However, as ELI avoided contentious issues, such as secession, it lacked support from the SPLA, but the NDA leadership accepted it. By 2001, ELI had been unable to bring about any agreement between the parties.\\n\\nIn September 2001, former U.S. Senator John Danforth was designated Presidential Envoy for Peace in the Sudan. His role was to explore the prospects that the US could play a useful catalytic role in the search for a just end to the civil war, and enhance humanitarian services delivery that can help reduce the suffering of the Sudanese people stemming from war related effects.\\n\\nFollowing an internal outcry, the Sadiq al-Mahdi government in March 1989 agreed with the United Nations and donor nations (including the US) on a plan called Operation Lifeline Sudan (OLS), under which some 100,000 tons of food was moved into both government and SPLA-held areas of the Sudan, and widespread starvation was averted. Phase II of OLS to cover 1990 was approved by both the government and the SPLA Sudan faced a 2-year drought and food shortage across the entire country. The US, UN, and other donors attempted to mount a coordinated international relief effort in both north and south Sudan to prevent a catastrophe. However, due to Sudan\\'s human rights abuses and its pro-Iraqi stance during the Gulf War, many donors cut much of their aid to the Sudan. In a similar drought in 2000–01, the international community again responded to avert mass starvation in the Sudan. International donors continue to provide large amounts of humanitarian aid to all parts of the Sudan.\\n\\nThe US government\\'s Sudan Peace Act of 21 October 2002 accused Sudan of genocide for killing more than 2 million civilians in the south during the civil war since 1983.\\n\\nSection::::Arms suppliers.\\nSudan relied on a variety of countries for its arms supplies. Following independence, the army was trained and supplied by the British. However, after the 1967 Six-Day War, relations were cut off, as were relations with the United States and West Germany.\\n\\nFrom 1968 to 1972, the Soviet Union and COMECON nations sold large numbers of weapons and provided technical assistance and training to Sudan. At this time the army grew from a strength of 18,000 to roughly 50,000 men. Large numbers of tanks, aircraft, and artillery were acquired, and they dominated the army until the late 1980s.\\n\\nRelations cooled between the two sides after the coup in 1972, and the Khartoum government sought to diversify its suppliers. The Soviet Union continued to supply weapons until 1977, when their support of Marxist elements in Ethiopia angered the Sudanese sufficiently to cancel their deals. The People\\'s Republic of China was the main supplier in the late 1970s.\\n\\nEgypt was the most important military partner in the 1970s, providing missiles, personnel carriers, and other military hardware. At the same time military cooperation between the two countries was important.\\n\\nU.S.-aligned countries resumed supplying Sudan in the mid-1970s. The United States began selling Sudan a great deal of equipment around 1976, hoping to counteract Soviet support of Marxist Ethiopians and Libyans. Military sales peaked in 1982 at US$101 million. West Germany established an ammunitions factory in Khartoum and introduced vast quantities of automatic small arms to Sudan. After the start of the second civil war, American assistance dropped, and was eventually cancelled in 1987.\\n\\nIn November 1993, Iran was reported to have financed Sudan´s purchase of some 20 Chinese ground-attack aircraft. Iran pledged $17 million in financial aid to the Sudanese government, and arranged for $300 million in Chinese arms to be delivered to the Sudanese army.\\n\\nMeanwhile, the rebel SPLA was supplied weapons through or by Eritrea, Ethiopia, and Uganda. The Israeli embassy in Kenya also supplied anti-tank missiles to the rebels.\\n\\nSection::::Child soldiers.\\nArmies from all sides enlisted children in their ranks. The 2005 agreement required that child soldiers be demobilized and sent home. The SPLA claimed to have let go 16,000 of its child soldiers between 2001 and 2004. However, international observers (UN and Global Report 2004) have found demobilized children have often been re-recruited by the SPLA. As of 2004, there were between 2,500 and 5,000 children serving in the SPLA. Rebels have promised to demobilize all children by the end of 2010. The goal was met.\\n\\nThe Nuer White Army, a minor participant in the war in the Greater Upper Nile region, consisted largely of armed Nuer youths, but it was principally self-organised and often operated autonomously of both elders\\' authority and the dictates of the major factions.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Second Sudanese Civil War', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1131537'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '4RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11315605', 'text': 'I.Ae. 24 Calquin\\n\\nThe I.Ae.24 Calquin (a Mapudungun word which means \"Royal Eagle\") was a tactical bomber designed and built by the \"Instituto Aerotécnico\" (Córdoba) in Argentina in the immediate post-World War II era. Although superficially a \"look-alike\" for the de Havilland Mosquito, the I.Ae.24 was powered by twin Pratt & Whitney R-1830-G “Twin Wasp” radials giving it a distinct appearance. After an operational career spanning two decades, the Calquin was retired.\\nSection::::Design and development.\\nPatterned after the successful de Havilland Mosquito, the Calquín had a wooden structure similar to the FMA AeMB.2, and was the first twin-engined aircraft designed and built in Argentina. The I.Ae.24 design was based on a cantilever mid-mounted wooden (indigenous woods were used throughout) wings with fabric-covered flying surfaces. The conventional main twin-oleo undercarriage retracted into the engine nacelles while the tailwheel retracted into the aft fuselage. The two-man crew were seated side-by-side under a large transparency constructed partly of acrylic glass with glass panels. The armament consisted of four 12.7\\xa0mm machine guns grouped in the nose. Some examples later had four 20\\xa0mm cannons and an internal bombload of 1,764\\xa0lb (800\\xa0kg) kg along with 12 rockets (75\\xa0mm) mounted under the wings.\\n\\nOriginally the I.Ae. 24 was also intended to be equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlins but an adequate supply of the powerplants was not possible, consequently Pratt & Whitney R-1830-G “Twin Wasp” radials of 1,050\\xa0hp (782.5\\xa0kW) were substituted. Performance estimates of a Merlin-powered variant would have made it comparable to the Mosquito but the R-1830-powered prototype was able to achieve only 273\\xa0mph (440\\xa0km/h), making the aircraft unstable and prone to stalling. A later prototype, the I.Ae.28 was equipped with Rolls-Royce Merlins but the project was superseded by the more capable I.Ae. 30 \"Ñancú\".\\n\\nSection::::Operational history.\\nDespite the lower performance obtained in testing, the I.Ae.24 Calquin was able to undertake an attack and light bombing role, replacing the Northrop A-17 in the Argentine Air Force inventory. A total of 100 aircraft were ordered, with the first production example flying on 4 July 1946. Fifty pilots and crew members were killed in accidents related to Calquín operational service and trials. Test pilots considered the aircraft unstable \"on all three axes\" and required careful handling. Series production was completed by 1950, with operational service continuing until 1957 although a small number of aircraft were still in squadron use until 1960.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'I.Ae. 24 Calquin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11315605'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '4hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1131669', 'text': 'Syria national football team\\n\\nThe Syria national football team (, ) represents Syria in association football and is controlled by the Syrian Arab Federation for Football, the governing body for football in Syria.

Verfaillie (; born 1957) is a Belgian molecular biologist and professor at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven (Leuven, Belgium). Her work on the ability of adult stem cells to differentiate to different cell types has garnered controversy due to accusations of poor laboratory practices and fabrication of data by members of her laboratory.\\n\\nSection::::Education and career.\\nBorn in Ypres, she obtained an M.D. from the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in 1982, after which she specialized in internal medicine. In 1987 she departed for the United States as a research fellow at the University of Minnesota. She worked in the lab of Phillip McGlave in hematopoiesis and stromal control of hematopoietic stem cells, in 1991 becoming a professor in the Department of Medicine, becoming a full professor in 1997.\\n\\nVerfaillie was Director of the Stem Cell Institute at the University of Minnesota (U.S.) from 1998 until 2006. In a widely noted paper in 2002, she claimed a specific type of adult-derived stem cells (termed multipotent adult progenitor cells (MAPC)).\\n\\nShe is a Professor of Medicine in the Division of Hematology, Oncology and Transplantation of the University of Minnesota\\'s Medical School. She holds the Anderson Chair in Stem Cell Biology and the McKnight\\'s Presidential Chair in Stem Cell Biology. She now leads the \"Stamcel Instituut te Leuven\" (SCIL, Stem Cell Institute Leuven) at the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven in Leuven, Belgium. She is a member of the Advisory Board of the Itinera Institute think-tank. \\n\\nSection::::Controversy and aftermath over stem cell falsification.\\nThe report was immediately sensational in scientific circles given that it was the first report of adult-derived stem cells to have properties previously ascribed to embryonic stem cell only. The report was immediately also heralded by conservative lawmakers opposed to embryonic stem cell research as proof that such research is not needed. Skepticism surrounded the announcement from the beginning: Stuart Orkin from the Harvard Medical School noted, \"\"If the cells are what she says -- and I have no reason to dispute that but no one has demonstrated it yet -- it\\'s pretty remarkable. For people interested in tissue regeneration, this would be the cell to work with.\"\"\\n\\nVerfaillie was noted to immediately benefit from the interest in adult stem cells with her lab size and funding immediately doubling.\\nThe discovery was considered so ground-breaking that she received several accolades in the first few years after the initial report. The British biomedical publication \"New Scientist\" declared it as the \"ultimate stem cell discovery\". Problems with working with MAPCs proved difficult to several laboratories who were keen to co-operate in expanding the use of MAPCs. In a report in \"Nature\", Dr. Rudolf Jaenisch at MIT was quoted by \"Nature\" stating that \"I have not seen any convincing data showing that anyone has repeated the chimaera experiment, so I don\\'t think this part of it is true\", referring to the claim by Verfaillie that MAPCs when injected into mouse embryos contribute to all tissues.\\n\\nThe same article also quoted Orkin as saying that the material transfer agreement (MTA) for procuring these cells were so restrictive that his group refused to work with them.\\nFirst reports on potential problems with Verfaillie\\'s group\\'s work came in early 2007 when \"New Scientist\" reported that the 2002 Nature paper had some of the images appear in a second paper published at about the same time. The article also revealed duplication of images in a 2001 paper on blood, authored by Verfaillie\\'s trainee, Morayma Reyes, and that a patent application for the MAPCs was licensed to a company called Athersys, based in Cleveland, Ohio. A series of investigations into at least three instances of data duplication/ fabrication by the University of Minnesota followed, which eventually concluded in October 2008 that Morayma Reyes had fabricated data in the 2001 paper. \\n\\nThe panel criticized Verfaillie\\'s laboratory for “poor scientific method and inadequate training and oversight for this research”. It contacted Blood and asked the journal to retract the paper. The investigators also found discrepancies with images in a second paper from Verfaillie\\'s laboratory, published in the \"Journal of Clinical Investigation\" in 2002. Those problems did not rise to the level of academic misconduct, the university said. It did not find fault directly with Verfaillie, but Tim Mulcahy concluded that the “message here is that everyone needs to fulfill their responsibility to the public and to science”.\\n\\nIn response to the investigation at the University of Minnesota, \"Nature\" instituted their own investigation to the 2002 controversial paper and Verfaillie was allowed to make a Corrigendum to the original paper, which did not acknowledge fabrication of data, and claimed that the original observation still held. The issue raised by Rudolf Jaenisch and others regarding the non-reproducibility of the blastocyst injection data was not addressed by the reviewers of Verfaillie. In early 2010, a third paper by the group in the \"American Journal of Cell Physiology\" was withdrawn due to \"data presented have now been shown to be unreliable. This was again prompted by an investigation by \\'New Scientist\".\\n\\nSection::::Aftermath of scandal and move back to Belgium.\\nVerfaillie moved to the Katholieke Universiteit Leuven at the height of the controversy in 2006 but retained her position at the University of Minnesota. She has continued to defend her work and gave a list of publications that have proven the utility of MAPCs, albeit without addressing the criticisms of how the key parts of her work could not be reproduced by other labs. In 2007, she collaborated with Irving Weissman at Stanford University to demonstrate that MAPCs could produce blood cells although she did not address the key claims of her original 2002 paper.\\n\\nVerfaillie is on the editorial board of journals such as \"Experimental Hematology\" and PLOS one.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Catherine Verfaillie', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11318854'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '5BhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1131913', 'text': 'Alasdair Alpin MacGregor\\n\\nAlasdair Alpin MacGregor (March 20, 1899 – 1970) was a Scottish writer and photographer, known for a large number of travel books. He wrote also on Scottish folklore, and was a published poet.\\n\\nSection::::Life.\\nHe was born at Applecross, Ross and Cromarty, on 20 March 1899, the son of Colonel John MacGregor M.D. of the Indian Medical Service. He was educated at Tain Academy.\\n\\nMacGregor was brought up in Tain and Inverness, and educated there and in Edinburgh. His books were mainly about Scotland, and his romanticising style incurred the displeasure of Compton Mackenzie, who caricatured him in some of his novels (perhaps unjustly so as MacGregor was forced to be critically realistic about certain aspects of life on the west coast, in his book \"The Western Isles\"). Judging by the title of the 1931 book \"A Last Voyage to St. Kilda. Being the Observations and Adventures of an Egotistic Private Secretary who was alleged to have been \\'warned off\\' That Island by Admiralty Officials when attempting to emulate Robinson Crusoe at the Time of Its Evacuation\" there might have been something to caricature. In partial explanation, St Kilda was evacuated in 1930; at the time he was Private Secretary to the Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster. The same book was the subject of a legal case when MacGregor brought an injunction to prevent the distribution of \"The Edge of the World\", a film by Michael Powell that he claimed was based on it. MacGregor lost the case.\\n\\nHe lived in London for most of his adult life in Swan Court and Upper Cheyne Row, Chelsea. Along with T. Ratcliffe Barnett, an Edinburgh minister and author, MacGregor reflects a transitional period during the first half of the 20th century when the north of Scotland was still rural and mostly unaffected by modern society.\\n\\nMacGregor was also a campaigner against cruelty to animals, including vivisection and hunting for sport. In the years before his death in 1970, he visited the United States often and was a mentor to a young Marion Barry, who later became mayor of Washington, D.C.\\n\\nHis book about his childhood, \"The Goat Wife\", tells the evocative story of his hard working and resourceful Aunt Dorothy, who left a comfortable existence in Edinburgh\\'s Ann Street - reputed to be the most haunted street in Edinburgh - to begin life as a solo crofter in the Easter Ross village of Ardgay (then known locally as \"High Wind\"). Spanning the period before the First World War until the end of the Second, it captures the last remnants of the simplicity, privations and charm of Scottish rural community life.

Orthologs are found in mammals and birds. It is a member of the toll-like receptor (TLR) family and detects single stranded RNA.\\n\\nSection::::Function.\\nThe TLR family plays an important role in pathogen recognition and activation of innate immunity. TLRs are highly conserved from Drosophila to humans and share structural and functional similarities. They recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that are expressed on infectious agents, and mediate the production of cytokines necessary for the development of effective immunity. The various TLRs exhibit different patterns of expression. This gene is predominantly expressed in lung, placenta, and spleen, and lies in close proximity to another family member, TLR8, on the human X chromosome.\\n\\nTLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA in endosomes, which is a common feature of viral genomes which are internalised by macrophages and dendritic cells. TLR7 recognizes single-stranded RNA of viruses such as HIV and HCV. TLR7 can recognize GU-rich single-stranded RNA. However, the presence of GU-rich sequences in the single-stranded RNA is not sufficient to stimulate TLR7.\\n\\nSection::::Clinical significance.\\nImiquimod acts upon TLR7.\\n\\nTLR7 has been shown to play a significant role in the pathogenesis of autoimmune disorders such as Systemic Lupus Erythematosus (SLE) as well as in the regulation of antiviral immunity. Although not yet fully elucidated, using an unbiased genome-scale screen with short hairpin RNA (shRNA), it has been demonstrated that the receptor TREML4 acts as an essential positive regulator of TLR7 signalling. In TREML4 -/- mice macrophages that are hyporesponsive to TLR7 agonists, macrophages fail to produce type I interferons due to impaired phosphorylation of the transcription factor STAT1 by the mitogen-activated protein kinase p38 and decreased recruitment of the adaptor MyD88 to TLR7. TREML4 deficiency reduced the production of inflammatory cytokines and autoantibodies in MRL/lpr mice, suggesting that TRL7 is a vital component of antiviral immunity and a predecessor factor in the pathogenesis of rheumatic diseases such as SLE. A TLR7 agonist, Aldara, an imidazoquinoline, has been approved for topical use in treating warts caused by papillomavirus and for actinic keratoses. \\n\\nDue to their ability to induce robust production of anti-cancer cytokines such as interleukin-12, TLR7 agonists have been investigated for cancer immunotherapy. Recent examples include TMX-202 delivery via liposomal formulation, as well as the delivery of resiquimod via nanoparticles formed from beta-cyclodextrin. \\n', 'title': 'TLR7', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11329477'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '6hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1133351', 'text': 'VSS Enterprise\\n\\nVSS \"Enterprise\" (tail number: N339SS) was the first SpaceShipTwo (SS2) spaceplane, built by Scaled Composites for Virgin Galactic.

This was the first spacecraft-related accident in which part, but not all, of the crew survived. An investigation revealed the accident was caused by premature deployment of the \"feathering\" system, the ship\\'s descent device; the NTSB also faulted the spacecraft\\'s design for lacking fail-safe mechanisms that could have deterred or prevented early deployment.\\n\\nSection::::Flight test program.\\nInitial projections by Virgin Galactic in 2008 called for test flights to begin in late 2009 and commercial service to start in 2011. This schedule was not achieved, with captive carry and glide flight tests beginning in 2010, and the first test flight under rocket power in 2013.\\n\\nIn October 2009, Virgin Galactic CEO Will Whitehorn outlined the flight test program for SpaceShipTwo. The test program includes seven phases:\\n\\nOn 22 March 2010, the SpaceShipTwo vehicle VSS \"Enterprise\" underwent a captive carry test flight, with the parent White Knight Two aircraft, VMS \"Eve\", performing a short flight while carrying the \"Enterprise\".\\nA second test flight was made on 16 May 2010, reaching SS2\\'s launch altitude (51,000 feet) and lasting nearly five hours, in order to facilitate \"cold soak\" testing of SS2\\'s avionics and pressurization system. Thereafter, \"a simulated spaceship descent/glide mission was made from [launch] altitude.\"\\nBetween these two flights, the SpaceShipTwo airframe was modified by the addition of two interior fins, with one fin being added to the inside (rocket-side) of each of the craft\\'s twin vertical stabilizers.\\n\\nOn 15 July 2010, VSS \"Enterprise\" made its first crewed flight. The craft remained attached to VMS \"Eve\" as planned, and underwent a series of combined vehicle systems tests. The flight lasted a total of 6 hours and 21 minutes. A second, similar crewed flight of VSS \"Enterprise\" and VMS \"Eve\" was carried out on 30 September 2010, lasting approximately 5 hours. Among the objectives of these flights was the improvement of pilot proficiency, and the results of the flights were deemed to show that the systems were capable of supporting future glide missions.\\n\\nOn 10 October 2010, VSS \"Enterprise\" made its first manned gliding test flight. It was released from VMS \"Eve\" at 13700 m feet and glided to a safe landing at the Mojave Air and Spaceport. A second gliding test flight took place on 28 October 2010 and a third on 17 November 2010. , Scaled reported that the flight test program was exceeding expectations. The fourth test flight took place on 13 January 2011, while the fifth and sixth glide flights occurred on 22 and 27 April 2011, respectively. Following this, the feathered reentry configuration was tested in flight on 4 May 2011, with weekly test flights continuing through the end of May.\\nOn 9 June 2011, SS2 failed to separate from White Knight Two during its 11th planned glide flight due to a technical problem. Testing resumed with five successful glide flights in June 2011.\\n\\nIn July 2011, after 15 successful glide flights, flight testing of SS2 was halted for two months while planned revisions to the spaceplane were made. Flight tests resumed in late September 2011, although the 16th glide flight\\xa0– on 29 September\\xa0– was marred by a brief loss of control aboard SS2, forcing the crew to utilise the feathered wing configuration to land safely. This test was followed by another hiatus, during which some of the spacecraft\\'s engine components were installed. In June 2012, Scaled Composites received an FAA permit to conduct rocket-powered supersonic test flights. SpaceShipTwo flight tests resumed in June 2012.\\n\\nIn September 2012, Virgin Galactic announced that the unpowered subsonic glide flight test program was essentially complete. The company thereafter stated its intention to fit the hybrid rocket motor and control system to the vehicle, before resuming the glide flight test program with the rocket motor installed, in order to recharacterize the spacecraft\\'s glide performance with slightly different weight distribution and aerodynamics. In October 2012, Scaled Composites installed key components of the rocket motor, and SpaceShipTwo performed its first glide flight with the engine installed in December 2012.\\n\\nThe spacecraft\\'s first powered test flight took place on 29 April 2013, briefly driving SpaceShipTwo to a supersonic velocity. Richard Branson said it \"couldn\\'t have gone more smoothly\".\\n\\nOn 5 September 2013, the second powered flight was made by the SpaceShipTwo. It broke the sound barrier achieving a speed of mach 1.43, and climbed to 69.000 feet (21\\xa0km) over the Mojave Desert under rocket power and descended using its tilt-wing \"feathering\" maneuver. Space journalist Doug Messier reported that \"the engine plume featured white smoke, not the black smoke seen on the April flight.\"\\n\\nOn 10 January 2014, the third powered flight climbed higher than the previous flights, testing a new coating on the tail boom and other systems.\\n\\nSection::::List of test flights.\\n\"Sources:\" \\n\\nLegend\\n\\nSection::::Crash.\\nOn 31 October 2014, \"Enterprise\" broke apart in flight during a powered test flight over California\\'s Mojave Desert. \\nThe flight began smoothly, with \"Enterprise\" being dropped from its WhiteKnightTwo carrier and igniting its engine at an altitude of . About 60 to 90 seconds into the flight, an \"anomaly\" was reported which resulted in destruction of the ship. The pilot in command, Peter Siebold, escaped from the craft and parachuted to safety; the copilot, Michael Alsbury, was killed in the crash.\\n\\nThe National Transportation Safety Board conducted an independent investigation into the accident. In July 2015, the NTSB released a report which cited inadequate design safeguards, poor pilot training, lack of rigorous federal oversight and a potentially anxious co-pilot without recent flight experience as important factors in the crash. The NTSB determined that the crash resulted from the pilot\\'s premature deployment of the feathering mechanism, which is normally used to aid a safe descent. The NTSB also faulted the ship\\'s designers for failing to protect against human error, noting that the spacecraft lacked fail-safe systems that would have prevented or deterred a premature deployment of the feathering mechanism. The NTSB recommended that the FAA establish human factors guidance specific to commercial spaceflight operators and create a more rigorous application process for experimental spaceflight permits.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'VSS Enterprise', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1133351'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '6xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11334051', 'text': 'Eusebio Oehl\\n\\nEusebio Oehl (December 5, 1827 – April 10, 1903) was an Italian histologist and physiologist who was a native of Lodi. \\n\\nHe studied medicine at the University of Pavia, and following graduation (1850), he continued his education in Vienna under Joseph Hyrtl (1810-1894) and Ernst Wilhelm von Brücke (1819-1892).

The episode was originally scheduled to be the series finale before Fox decided to renew the series.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nWith Lucky and Luanne engaged, the couple have begun planning their wedding. Luanne believes that Lucky\\'s lawsuit winnings mean that they can have a lavish wedding, despite Lucky telling her that he doesn\\'t have much of his settlement money left. Willing to do what it takes to make Luanne\\'s wedding dreams come true, Lucky seeks advice from Hank. Hank, despite objecting to Luanne\\'s extravagant desires, refers Lucky to Dale, who with a citywide bedbug epidemic on his hands has more pest control calls than he alone can handle. When Dale gives Lucky a gas mask and goggles for his new job, he says that the equipment makes him look like a bug, and the two have a mock-swordfight with spray wands. However, Lucky sustains a fall as they do so and suffers a back injury, regretfully deciding that he\\'ll have to sue Dale\\'s Dead-Bug in order to afford Luanne\\'s dream wedding. After Lucky\\'s tort lawyer Edward Johnson determines that there\\'s no money to be made in suing Dale, he convinces Lucky to instead sue Strickland Propane after using convoluted jargon to pin blame on Hank, as a Strickland employee, for having referred Lucky to Dale in the first place.\\n\\nLuanne remains indifferent to Hank\\'s disgust at the frivolous lawsuit; however, Lucky continues to regret the situation. After discussing things with Hank, Lucky goes back to Johnson and asks to drop the lawsuit, but Johnson guilts him out of dropping by saying that it would be malpractice to do so. Dismayed, Lucky relays Johnson\\'s refusal to the guys, and Dale comes up with a plan: have Lucky fake not being injured so that there will appear to be no grounds to sue. Hank, Dale, and Lucky film a video of Lucky teeing off at the golf course (with Lucky barely suppressing his pain long enough to make it look convincing) and bring it to Johnson, who agrees that the footage is enough to destroy the case. However, Lucky drops a tire pressure gauge on the floor of the law office, and Johnson waits with a smirk for the \\'man with the perfectly healthy back\\' to pick it up, watching as Lucky struggles to reach it. Thinking quickly, Lucky tells Dale that he looks like a bug, and Dale catches on, grabs a nearby umbrella, and knocks Lucky down. With Lucky in pain on the floor of the office, Hank tells Johnson that they could now sue \"him\" using the same jargon with which he had intended to sue Strickland Propane, since they have the video footage of Lucky appearing healthy prior to coming to his office. Defeated and Furious, Johnson cuts Lucky a check for $53,000 on the spot.\\n\\nLuanne\\'s delight with the new settlement money quickly changes to indignance when Lucky proposes to instead use the money to buy a house and have a simpler, less expensive wedding. Her mind decidedly changes, however, when Lucky also shows her that they will have enough left over to buy baby clothes as well. On the day of the wedding, which is being held in the Hills\\' backyard, Hank goes to Luanne who seems a bit depressed over how basic the wedding is and apologizes for the simplicity of the ceremony, and she forgives him when he presents her with a wedding gift of two airline tickets and hotel fare to anywhere in the continental United States. Reverend Stroup arrives, and Luanne and Lucky are happily married before a large audience of friends and family. Afterward, as Lucky\\'s truck pulls into the driveway of the newlyweds\\' new home across the street, Hank and his friends contentedly sip beer in the alley.\\n\\nSection::::Production notes.\\nAs the episode was originally intended as the series finale, it includes references to earlier episodes. For example, in the ending wedding scene, a montage of many \\'one-time\\' and other minor characters from previous episodes at the wedding, including the social worker from the first episode and \"Junkie Business\", Monsignor Martinez, Luanne\\'s beauty-school teacher Ms. Kremzer, Sharona Johnson, \"Hottyyz\" Owner Collete Davis, \"Arlen Bystander\" Columnist Bob Jenkins, Lucky\\'s friends Elvin and Mud Dobber, Ted, Cindy, and Chane Wassanasong, Hank\\'s half-brother Junichiro, Patch Boomhauer and his Grandmother, Tammy Duvall, Mack Walker, Hank\\'s Mother Tillie and her husband Gary Kasner, Ms. Wakefield, Ernst, Peggy\\'s mother (\"A Rover Runs Through It\" version) and Dale\\'s father Bug Gribble are seen. Also, Cotton Hill tells Kahn that he\\'ll have a mai tai at the wedding much like he did in his first appearance in the episode \"Shins of the Father\". Chuck Mangione appears at the end of the wedding scene. Once an often recurring character in early seasons, he has rarely appeared in more recent episodes.

Where a player decides not to answer their question, the team captain will normally decide which other member of the team is to answer. The opposition will also decide who is to answer the question in the event of it being passed over. After 4 rounds, the order of answering changes so the team who began round 1 going first begin round 5 going second. This is done by switching each team\\'s questions from A to B or from B to A depending on which questions they started with.\\n\\nIn league competitions, a win scores four points, a draw scores two points and a close defeat (losing by three points or fewer) scores one point. In addition, if all four members of a team get all of their own questions correct in any given round (a \"full house\"), an additional bonus point is scored.\\n\\nIn knockout competitions where a draw is not permitted, an additional ninth round of questions is played. If the scores are still tied at the end of the ninth round, a tie-breaker is played.\\n\\nSection::::Individual format.\\nMany quiz leagues run individual competitions. QLL\\'s uses the MIMIR quiz format (named after Mímir, a god of Norse mythology who was renowned for his knowledge and wisdom). Matches are played in groups of four with positions drawn at random and each person has 3 questions addressed to them, in each of 5 rounds.\\n\\nTime to answer is at the discretion of the question master but a wrong answer or a pass gives any of the other three an opportunity to score a bonus point. The decision as to who gets the first chance to answer for a bonus is determined by offering the question to whoever, at that stage, has made fewest attempts to gain bonus points or, if there is more than one player who has made the fewest bonus attempts, the next player in line (e.g. if this happened on the first question, P2 would have the first option on a bonus attempt). As well as a scorekeeper, a bonus counter is needed to track each player\\'s bonus attempts.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'The Quiz League of London', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11342728'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11343294', 'text': 'Tuto\\n\\nLivonir Ruschel (born 2 July 1979 in Dionísio Cerqueira) is a Brazilian professional football player.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Tuto', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11343294'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8hhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11344265', 'text': 'Caumasee\\n\\nCaumasee (Romansh: \"Lag la Cauma\" or \"Lai da Cauma\") is a lake near Flims, in the Grisons, Switzerland. It is one of the lakes on the Flims Rockslide deposits. The lake is fed from underground sources. Its surface area is 10.3194\\xa0ha.\\n\\nThe level of the lake varies by approximately 4 to 5 meters along with the varying underground water flow during the year, hence reaches its minimum by the end of April when snow melting in the mountains increases. A maximum level is reached by mid July but may be topped in August even after previous falling due to summer rain. The very western bay never freezes in winter, probably showing a maximum water flow in this area.\\n\\nWhen the lake is at a low level, with a small volume of water, it warms up sooner than most lakes in the region, so people can be seen starting to swim the lake in April while bigger lakes even in lower areas of Switzerland remain rather cool. Water temperature in summer is at an average 21 Celsius, with a maximum around 24 Celsius.\\n\\nThe lake is in a huge forest that was allowed to remain on the agriculturally useless debris area of the biggest prehistoric rockslide in the Alps and can only be reached by a footpath (wheelchair accessible), possibly using a funicular built in 1939, refurbished in 1988 on its original tracks (running May to October only). The walk from the edge of town to the funicular takes about 10 minutes.\\n\\nSection::::Flow system.\\nAs close as 500 yards to the Caumasee is another dell and altering lake, called Lag Tuleritg, which is just about level to the Caumasee; it is just 18 meters higher. This lake dries out completely in autumn and remains empty until being filled by a small river of just about 800m in length, covering some 100 meters difference in altitude. That river will start flowing around May, depending on temperatures and snow melt rate in the mountains. Its origin is another lake, Lag Prau Pulté, which is fed by underground water only in spring, disappearing in autumn and staying dry all winter. During a cold period in spring, water that entered the basin of this lake may disappear again as snow melt decreases and all water remains in the underground flow. Due to its origin, the water of both lakes is grey all summer until the level starts to go down in autumn. In Lag Prau Pulte one can see another special effect caused by air being forced out of the underground; this is causing the lake not only to remain grey but to frequently produce bubbles and therefore different colours can be seen on the surface.\\n\\nThe flow system has been severely attacked by building the Flims Bypass Tunnel when engineers decided to divert some 800 Litres per minute of underground water flow out of the tunnel instead of sealing it into the rock. Further changes occurred when the basin that fills with water every year, was slightly altered. Since 2011 additional water is being fed near the tunnel into the river running from Lag Prau Pulte to Lag Tuleritg to compensate the water loss in the underground system.\\n\\nA fourth lake, Crestasee, is also fed by underground water but retains a constant level all year.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Caumasee', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11344265'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '8xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1134489', 'text': \"List of airports in Indonesia\\n\\nThis is a list of airports in Indonesia, sorted by location.\\n\\nThe Republic of Indonesia comprises 13,466 islands in Southeast Asia and Oceania.

Judah Löb\".\\n\\nAt the age of twenty he went to Berlin, where he received instruction from Isaac Satanow, who was a follower of Moses Mendelssohn. In Berlin Löwe met Mendelssohn, his acquaintance with whom soon ripened into friendship. Mendelssohn\\'s influence was doubtless instrumental in securing for Löwe the position of tutor in the house of the influential David Friedländer. Löwe became a most intimate friend of another prominent Mendelssohnian, Isaac Abraham Euchel, whose first work, a Hebrew biography of Mendelssohn, contains a dedicatory letter addressed to Löwe.

Glossop is near Derbyshire\\'s county borders with Cheshire, Greater Manchester, South Yorkshire and West Yorkshire. It is between above mean sea level, and lies just outside the Peak District National Park.\\n\\nHistorically, the name Glossop refers to the small hamlet that gave its name to an ancient parish recorded in the Domesday Book of 1086, and then the manor given by William I of England to William Peverel. A municipal borough was created in 1866, and the unparished urban area within two local government wards. The area now known as Glossop approximates to the villages that used to be called Glossopdale, on the lands of the Duke of Norfolk. Originally a centre of wool processing, Glossop rapidly expanded in the late 18th century when it specialised in the production and printing of calico, a coarse cotton, and became a mill town with many chapels and churches, its fortunes tied to the cotton industry.\\n\\nArchitecturally, the area is dominated by buildings constructed of the local sandstone. There remain two significant former cotton mills and the Dinting railway viaduct. Glossop has transport links to Manchester, making the area popular for commuters.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Toponymy and definition.\\nThe name Glossop is thought to be of Anglo-Saxon origin, named during the Angles\\' settlement in the 7th century, and derived from \"Glott\\'s Hop\" – where \"hop\" could mean a valley, a small valley in a larger valley system, or a piece of land enclosed by marshes and \"Glott\" was probably a chieftain\\'s name. Because of its size and location, Glossop had many definitions. The village of Glossop is now called Old Glossop. Howard Town and Milltown gained importance. They were named New Town and then Glossop. Local government reorganisations had caused the Glossopdale villages to be promoted to a municipal borough and then have that status removed. Land has been added to Glossop and other lands removed. From a small settlement it became an ancient parish, a manor, a borough, and a township. Currently, two county divisions in High Peak Borough, Derbyshire, have Glossop as part of their names.\\n\\nSection::::Roman.\\nThere is evidence of a Bronze Age burial site on Shire Hill (near Old Glossop) and other possibly prehistoric remains at Torside (on the slopes of Bleaklow). The Romans arrived in 78 AD. At that time, the area was within the territory of the Brigantes tribe, whose main base was in Yorkshire. In the late 1st century the Romans built a fort, Ardotalia, on high ground above the river in present-day Gamesley. The site of this fort was rediscovered in 1771 by an amateur historian, John Watson. It subsequently acquired the name Melandra Castle. The extensive site has been excavated, revealing fort walls, a shrine and the fort headquarters. The area has been landscaped to provide parking and picnic areas.\\n\\nSection::::Medieval.\\nKing William I awarded the manor of Glossop to William Peveril, who began construction of Glossop Castle, but the entire estate was later confiscated. In 1157 King Henry II gave the manor of Glossop to Basingwerk Abbey. They gained a market charter for Glossop in 1290, and one for Charlesworth in 1328.\\nIn 1433, the monks leased all of Glossopdale to the Talbot family, later Earls of Shrewsbury. In 1494, an illegitimate son of the family, Dr John Talbot, was appointed vicar of Glossop. He founded a school, and paved the packhorse route over the moors; this is known as Doctor\\'s Gate.\\n\\nAt the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1537 the manor of Glossop was given to the Talbot family. In 1606 it came into the ownership of the Howard family, the Dukes of Norfolk, who held it for the next 300 years. Glossop was usually given to the second son of the family.\\nThe land was too wet and cold to be used for wheat but was ideal for the hardy Pennine sheep, so agriculture was predominantly pastoral. Most of the land was owned by the Howards and was leasehold and it was only in Whitfield that there was any freehold land. The few houses were solid, built of the local stone, and allowed for the development of home industries such as wool spinning and weaving.\\n\\nSection::::Industrial and civic history.\\nThe medieval economy was based on sheep pasture and the production of wool by farmers who were tenants of the Abbot of Basingwerk and later the Talbot family. During the Industrial Revolution of the 18th century Glossop became a centre for cotton spinning. A good transport network between Liverpool and Glossop brought in imported cotton which was spun by a labour force with wool spinning skills. The climate of Glossopdale provided abundant soft water that was used to power mills and finish the cloth, and also gave the humidity necessary to spin cotton under tension. Initial investment was provided by the Dukes of Norfolk. By 1740, cotton in an unspun form had been introduced to make fustians and lighter cloths.\\n\\nSection::::Mills.\\nThe first mills in Glossop were woollen mills. In 1774, Richard Arkwright opened a mill at Cromford. He developed the factory system and patented machines for spinning cotton and carding. In 1785, his patents expired and many people copied Arkwright\\'s system and his patents, exemplified by the Derwent Valley Mills. By 1788 there were over 200 Arkwright-type mills in Britain. At the same time there were 17 cotton mills in Derbyshire, principally in Glossop. By 1831 there were at least 30 mills in Glossopdale, none of which had more than 1,000 spindles. The mill owners were local men: the Wagstaffs and Hadfields were freeholders from Whitfield; the Shepleys, Shaws, Lees, Garlicks and Platts had farmed the dale. The Sidebottoms were from Hadfield, the Thornleys were carpenters and John Bennet and John Robinson were clothiers.\\n\\nJohn Wood of Marsden came from Manchester in 1819 and bought existing woollen mills which he expanded. These were the Howard Town mills. Francis Sumner was a Catholic whose family had connections with Matthew Ellison, Howard\\'s agent. He built Wren Nest Mill. The Sidebottoms built the Waterside Mill at Hadfield. In 1825, John Wood installed the first steam engine and power looms. Sumner and Sidebottom followed suit and the three mills, Wren Nest, Howardtown and Waterside, became very large vertical combines (a vertical combine was a mill that both spun the yarn and then used it to weave cloth). With the other major families, the Shepleys, Rhodes and Platts, they dominated the dale. In 1884, the six had 82% of the spinning capacity with 892,000 spindles and 13,571 looms. Glossop was a town of very large calico mills. The calico printing factory of Edmund Potter (located in Dinting Vale) in the 1850s printed 2,500,000 pieces of printed calico, of which 80% was for export. The paper industry was created by Edward Partington who, as Olive and Partington, bought the Turn Lee Mill in 1874 to produce high-quality paper from wood pulp by the sulphite method. He expanded rapidly with mills in Salford and Barrow-in-Furness. He merged with Kellner of Vienna and was created Lord Doverdale in 1917. He died in 1925; his factories in Charlestown created nearly 1,000 jobs.\\n\\nSection::::Religion and benevolence.\\nLord Bernard Edward Howard, 12th Duke of Norfolk rebuilt the old parish church in 1831, built All Saints Roman Catholic chapel in 1836, improved the Hurst Reservoir in 1837, and built the town hall, whose foundation stone was laid on Coronation Day 1838.\\nThe Sheffield, Ashton-under-Lyne and Manchester Railway came to Dinting in 1842, but it was the 13th Duke of Norfolk who built the spur line to Howard Town, so that coal could be brought from the collieries at Dukinfield. Glossop railway station bears the lion, the symbol of the Norfolks. Many of the street- and placenames in Glossop derive from the names and titles of the Dukes of Norfolk, such as Norfolk Square, and a cluster of residential streets off Norfolk Street that were named after Lord Henry Charles Fitzalan Howard, the 13th Duke of Norfolk, the first Catholic MP since the Reformation. (His second son was created 1st Baron Howard of Glossop and was ancestor of the post-1975 Dukes.)\\n\\nA two-storey Township Workhouse was built between 1832 and 1834 on Bute Street (). Its administration was taken over by Glossop Poor Law Union in December 1837. The workhouse buildings included a 40-bed infirmary, piggeries and casual wards for vagrants. The workhouse later became Glossop Public Assistance Institution and from 1948 the N.H.S. Shire Hill Hospital.\\n\\nThe mill owners, Catholics, Anglican, Methodist and Unitarian, built reading rooms and chapels. They worked together and worshipped together with their workers. The Woods, Sidebottoms and Shepleys were Anglicans and hence Tory, and they dominated every vestry, which was the only form of local government before 1866. They built four churches St James\\'s, Whitfield in 1846, St Andrew\\'s, Hadfield in 1874, Holy Trinity, Dinting in 1875 and St Luke\\'s, Glossop. Francis Sumner and the Ellisons and Norfolks were Catholic and built St Charles\\'s, Hadfield and St Mary\\'s, Glossop. The smaller mill owners were Dissenters and congregated at Littlemoor Independent Chapel built in Hadfield in 1811, but they later built a further eleven chapels.\\n\\nFor decades there was rivalry between Edward Partington, his friend Herbert Rhodes, and the Woods and Sidebottoms. The Woods built the public baths and laid out the park. Partington built the library. Partington built the cricket pavilion, so Samuel Hill-Wood sponsored the football club that for one season, 1889–1890, played in League Division One. He and his descendants went on to be chairmen of the London club, Arsenal. He was MP for High Peak from 1910–1929. Edward\\'s son, Oswald, was MP for High Peak from 1900–1910. Ann Kershaw Woods devoted herself to Anglican education and had schools built.\\n\\nSection::::Cotton famine and industrial relations.\\nIn 1851, 38% of the men and 27% of the women were employed in cotton; the only alternative employment was agriculture, building, or labouring on the railway. Consequently, the town was vulnerable to interruptions in the supply of cotton or the export trade. The American Civil War caused the cotton famine of 1861–64. The mill owners met together and put in place a relief programme through which they supplied food, clogs and coal to their employees. Howard increased the workforce on his estate, and public works (such as improving the domestic water supply) were undertaken. They provided unsecured loans to the workers until the cotton returned. The relationship between the owners and men was one of paternal benevolence. They lived in the same community and worshipped in the same churches. The mill owners were the local aldermen, the church elders and led the sports teams. In the Luddite and Chartist times and the period following Peterloo, Glossop was virtually unaffected, despite its proximity to Hyde, a radical hotbed. In the \\'4s 2d or swing strike\\' it was incomers from Ashton who stopped the Glossop mills. The rivalry in Glossop was not based on class, but on religious groups.\\n\\nSection::::Modern (20th and 21st centuries).\\nThe decline of cotton spinning has resulted in the closure of many of the town\\'s mills. The Howard family sold the Glossop Estate in 1925 and donated large areas to the people of Glossop. Manor Park was the location of the family\\'s manor house and gardens. The recession of 1929 hit Glossop very hard: in 1929 the unemployment rate was 14%, and in 1931 it was 55%. In Hadfield it reached 67%. National initiatives to improve housing and employment conditions largely failed, and mills fell empty and decayed. Unemployment remained at 36% in 1938. The Second World War changed this: military stores, metals, machine tools, munitions, rubber and essential industries moved into the empty factories and left Glossop with a more diverse range of industries.\\n\\nIn spite of the post-war Barlow Report and government intervention, no significant employer moved into Glossop.\\n\\nGamesley underwent considerable change in the 1960s, when a large council estate was built, mainly to house people from Manchester. These housing areas, called \\'Overspill estates\\', were also built in other towns surrounding Manchester.\\n\\nIn 2006 High Peak Borough Council granted planning permission for a local foam factory to store up to 120 tonnes of toluene diisocyanate. Further permissions granted in 2010 increased the amount to 280 tonnes. As a result of this, a Detailed Emergency Planning Zone and Extended Area of Risk were created, which encompasses Dinting, Hadfield and Gamesley, as well as parts of Padfield, Simmondley and Hollingworth.\\n\\nSection::::Plans.\\nGlossop has been included as pilot in the Liveability scheme, and has drawn up the Glossop Vision masterplan for the improvement and gentrification of the town. This is being partially funded by the Heritage Lottery Fund. It aims to open up access to the Glossop Brook, to coordinate developments in Glossop town centre, to enhance the built environment and to link the town to its wider setting. As such, the mills have become a retail development with housing, trees are to be planted along the A57 and the market square has been pedestrianised.\\n\\nSection::::Governance.\\nIn the local government reorganisation of 1974 the Borough of Glossop was abolished, and since then the two levels of local government are Derbyshire County Council, based in Matlock, and High Peak Borough Council then based in Chapel-en-le-Frith.\\n\\nGlossop was included in the \"South East Lancashire Special Review Area\" under the Local Government Act 1958, and the Redcliffe-Maud Report of 1969 recommended its inclusion in a South East Lancashire–North East Cheshire metropolitan area. Glossop was not ultimately included in the Greater Manchester area established by the Local Government Act 1972. Local people voted to stay within the County of Derbyshire in 1973. The county council, originally based in Derby, moved to Matlock in the late 1950s to facilitate easier travelling to the county hall from the northern extremities such as Glossop and the High Peak.\\n\\nFor the county council Glossop is split between the divisions of Glossop and Charlesworth, and Etherow. Etherow division contains Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Gamesley and the large and sparsely populated Tintwistle ward, which was formerly in Cheshire. These boundaries were set in 2013.\\n\\nAt the district level, that is High Peak Borough Council, Glossop comprises these wards: Dinting, Gamesley, Hadfield North, Hadfield South, Old Glossop, Padfield, Howard Town, Simmondley and Whitfield. St John\\'s represents the rural area that was formerly Glossopdale RDC and lies within the National Park. These were the wards used in the 2001 Census.\\nGlossop itself does not have a parish council, but Tintwistle and St John\\'s are parished.\\n\\nThe Member of Parliament for the High Peak constituency since 2017 has been Ruth George MP, representing the Labour Party. Her majority in the 2017 general election was 2,322 over the Conservative candidate Andrew Bingham.\\n\\nSection::::Historic Glossop.\\nHistorically, the ancient parish of Glossop consisted of the ten townships of the manor: Glossop, Hadfield, Padfield, Dinting, Simmondley, Whitfield, Chunal, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Ludworth and nine more: Mellor, Thornsett, Rowarth, Whittle (Whitle), Beard, Ollersett, Hayfield, Little Hayfield, Phoside, Kinder, Bugsworth, Brownside and Chinley. Within the parish were the chapelries of Hayfield and Mellor. The ancient parish was in the Hundred of High Peak; it was about in length and wide, with an area of . Beard, Ollerset, Thornsett, Rowarth and Whitle later formed the town of New Mills, while Hayfield, Little Hayfield, Phoside and Kinder joined the parish of Hayfield. The chapelry of Mellor included Mellor, Chisworth, Ludworth, Whittle and part of Thornsett.\\n\\nThe Manor of Glossop was made up of the territory that includes Hadfield, Padfield, Dinting, Simmondley, Whitfield, Chunal, Charlesworth, Chisworth, Ludworth and the village of Glossop, now called Old Glossop. It had an area of , of which more than were classed as moorland.\\n\\nThe present community of Glossop is centred on Howardtown. It is served by the Glossopdale Area Forum and the Glossop Town Partnership.\\nThe previous hamlet of Glossop is now known as Old Glossop.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nGlossop is northwest of London, east of the city of Manchester, west of the city of Sheffield and north of Derby. It nestles in the foothills of the Pennines, with Bleaklow to the northeast and Kinder Scout to the south. It lies on Glossop Brook, a tributary of the River Etherow, in the area of peat moorland commonly known as the Dark Peak. The moors, which rise to over 1,960 ft, are cut by many deep V-shaped valleys known as cloughs, each formed by a stream known as a brook. Shelf Brook passes through Old Glossop where it joins Hurst Brook to form Glossop Brook, which passes westward through Milltown, Howard Town and Dinting to the River Etherow, which in turn runs south to join the River Goyt at Marple Bridge. Two other notable brooks are Padfield Brook and Gnat Hole Brook.\\n\\nShelf Brook leads from Shelf Moor on Bleaklow down Doctor\\'s Gate through Old Glossop to Glossop Brook. The valley was used by the Romans for a road, and currently contains a bridleway. The north slope of Holden Clough and Hurst Brook is used by the A57 road known as the Snake Pass. The Snake Pass crosses the Pennine Way near Doctor\\'s Gate Culvert (1,680 ft above sea level) before descending to the east to Ladybower Reservoir along the northern side of the River Ashop valley. Here a road leads east over Hallam Moor into Sheffield, and south along the River Derwent into Baslow and Matlock. To the north of Glossop is Tintwistle; the River Etherow is the boundary. Today, the Longdendale valley forms a chain of reservoirs that provide drinking water for Manchester. At the head of the valley is Woodhead, where the road from Huddersfield joins the road to Sheffield, and a three-mile railway tunnel brought the railway from Penistone.\\n\\nSection::::Geology.\\nDirectly beneath Glossop lie areas of Carboniferous Millstone Grit, shales and sandstone. Glossop is on the edge of the Peak District Dome, at the southern edge of the Pennine anticline. The Variscan uplift has caused much faulting and Glossopdale was the product of glacial action in the last glaciation period that exploited the weakened rocks. The steep-sided valleys of the cloughs cause significant erosion and deposition. The layers of sandstone, mudstones and shale in the bedrock act as an aquifer to feed the springs. The valley bottoms have a thin deposit of boulder clay. The brooks are fed by the peaty soils of the moors thus are acid (pH5.5–7.0); this means the instream wildlife is dependent on food sources from outside the channel.\\n\\nSection::::Climate.\\nGlossop experiences a temperate maritime climate, like much of the British Isles, with relatively cool summers and mild winters. There is regular but generally light precipitation throughout the year. Glossop has a history of flash flooding, the most recent being in 2002 when High Street West was flooded to a depth of .\\n\\nSection::::Demography.\\nGlossop has been subject to frequent boundary changes, so different analyses can be made of the same raw datasets depending on how the \\'equivalent\\' area is interpreted, which may or may not bear the same name.\\n\\nSection::::Economy.\\nGlossop was a product of the wealth of the cotton industry. Glossop\\'s economy was linked closely with a spinning and weaving tradition which had evolved from developments in textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Before the First World War, Glossop had the headquarters of an international paper empire, the largest calico printworks in the world, a large bleach works and six spinning weaving combines with over 600,000\\xa0spindles and 12,000\\xa0looms and two niche manufacturers: grindstones and industrial belts. In the 1920s, these firms were refloated on the easily available share capital—thus were victims of the Stock Market Crash of 1929. Their product lines were vulnerable to the new economic conditions.\\n\\nThe main street contains a variety of shops, restaurants and food outlets.\\n\\nGlossop is located close to the border of the Peak National Park, and to the east are the open moorlands of the Dark Peak. The local economy benefits from the many thousands of tourists who visit the park each year and who use Glossop as the \"Gateway to the Peak\".\\n\\nWren Nest Mill on High Street West was built c.\\xa01800–10, with further extensions in 1815 and 1818, the latter incorporating an octagonal tower. The present building is a small part of the original complex, which in its heyday employed 1,400 workers operating 123,000 spindles and 2,541 looms. It ceased trading in 1955. A major fire in 1996 destroyed half the mill. The remaining half has been redeveloped into flats and retail units.\\nFrom a group of small mills at Bridge End, John Wood built a complex of mills. Bridge End Mill was originally built in 1782 as a fulling mill. Today one mill building is being restored, and the Milltown mills lie idle.\\nGlossop Town Hall and Market House was designed in Italianate style by Sheffield architects Weightman and Hadfield. The foundation stone was laid on 28 June 1838, the Coronation Day of Queen Victoria. The buildings were opened on 10 July 1845. Cost of construction exceeded £8,500. The facilities included a lock-up with four cells heated by hot water.\\nThe viaduct was built in 1845, and later reinforced with additional piers. An accident occurred in 1855, when an MS&LR passenger train was stopped by signalling on the viaduct at night. Two men and a woman mistook the parapet of the viaduct for the station platform at Hadfield, alighted from the train and fell 75 feet to their deaths.\\n\\nSection::::Landmarks.\\nThe present-day (2008) fabric of the parish church of All Saints is mostly of the 20th century; very little remains of the previous churches on this site.\\nThe first mention of a church in Glossop is in the charter of 1157 conferring the manor of Glossop on Basingwerk Abbey. Although the dedication of the church to All Saints may indicate an Anglo-Saxon origin, no trace of such a church has been found. The first recorded vicar is William, of 1252. At this time the church was probably aisleless. It was altered in the 15th century when the nave was rebuilt with arcades, aisles and a still extant (2008) arch at the east end of the north aisle. In 1554 a new and taller tower with a broach spire was built 3 feet west of the old tower, incorporating the east wall of the previous tower. The nave was completely rebuilt in 1831, with removal and replacement of much of the old fabric including the tracery of the aisle windows. The work was carried out by the firm of E. W. Drury of Sheffield, the cost far exceeding the initial estimate of £700. When the nave was rebuilt in 1914 it was discovered that the arch leading to the chancel had been partly made up of plaster, the wall supported by this arch had not been bonded into the existing chancel walls, and the \"oak\" roof bosses were also plaster. Between the pillars of the nave sleeper walls had been built to a higher level than the pillar bases. These walls appear to have been needed to counteract the effects on the church structure of a combination of excess drainage from the nearby hillside and the numerous burials inside the church. The pillars of the new nave of 1914 were superimposed on the bases of the old pillars, and the floor built up to cover the sleeper walls.\\n\\nThe tower and chancel were demolished and rebuilt in 1853–55, the new tower also having a broach spire. The chancel was again rebuilt in 1923, completing the architect C. M. Hadfield\\'s plan of 1914. The present church has a nave of 5 bays, 25 yards long by 16 yards wide, with north and south aisles, and a chancel of 14 yards by 7 yards with a north aisle dedicated as St Catherine\\'s Chapel.\\n\\nTwo public open spaces in Glossop have been given the Green Flag award: Manor Park close to the town centre, which has views of the surrounding countryside, and Howard Park, which was described by the Award organisation as \"a good example of visionary layout from the Victorian era retaining many original features\". Glossop\\'s parkrun takes place in Manor Park every Saturday at 9am. Harehills Park, with its riverside footpath and mature trees, has been identified by Glossop Vision as a strategic open space, and was donated by the 2nd Lord Howard of Glossop as a First World War memorial.\\n\\nSection::::Transport.\\nSection::::Roads.\\nThe main road through Glossop is the A57. To the west, this road (with the parallel M67 motorway) leads to Manchester, while Sheffield and the Hope Valley lie to the east, via the Snake Pass. The B6105 leads north then east, along the Woodhead Pass (A628) and eventually to the South Yorkshire town of Barnsley and the M1 motorway. Chapel-en-le-Frith, Buxton and Derby lie to the south, along the A624 and A6.\\n\\nSection::::Public transport.\\nPublic transport is coordinated by Derbyshire County Council, with the exception of rail travel and some bus services being provided by Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM).\\n\\nSection::::Rail.\\nThere are regular half-hour train services, increasing to every 20 minutes during rush hour, from Glossop railway station to Manchester Piccadilly station and Hadfield railway station along the remaining stub of the former Woodhead Line.\\nA user group, the Friends of Glossop Station, are working to make the station more attractive and to encourage greater use of public transport. The trains operated on the line are three-car Class 323 electric multiple units built in 1992–1993 by Hunslet TPL.\\n\\nSection::::Buses.\\nThere are regular bus services running to towns in Tameside, to Buxton, New Mills and Whaley Bridge.\\n\\nThe majority of bus services in Glossop are operated by Stagecoach Manchester and High Peak.\\n\\nSection::::Schools and further education.\\nIt will be noticed that a large proportion of the primary education is provided by the faith schools.\\n\\nSection::::Sport.\\nGlossop is the smallest town in England to have had a team in the top tier of the English football league system. Glossop North End were members of the Football League between 1898 and 1915, and around the turn of the 20th century played in Division One. The team now plays in the North West Counties Football League Premier Division. In the 2008–09 season they reached the final of the FA Vase at Wembley Stadium on 10 May 2009. To mark this achievement, Arsenal (with whom they retain connections due to Arsenal chairman Peter Hill-Wood\\'s grandfather Sir Samuel Hill-Wood having owned and bankrolled Glossop during their run in the Football League) invited them to their state-of-the-art London Colney training ground during their stay in London, to prepare for the final. Glossop lost 2–0 to Northern League First Division side Whitley Bay.\\n\\nSection::::Culture.\\nSection::::Performing arts.\\nPartington Theatre is an amateur theatre with a 120-seat venue in the centre of the town. It runs six plays each season and was established in 1954. The building was started in 1914 and completed in 1917. \\n\\nGlossop Operatic and Dramatic Society is an amateur musical/drama society established in 1976. \\n\\nGlossop & District Choral Society is a community choir founded in 1949 by Margaret Lomas.\\n\\nSection::::Community events.\\nGlossop Victorian Weekend was the biggest weekend event in Glossop and was featured on the BBC\\'s \"Songs of Praise\". The weekend included many activities, including a Grand Victorian Costume Competition and a Shop Window Competition. The Victorian Weekend was discontinued in 2009 due to lack of local support. Running parallel with the Victorian Weekend was Glossop Beer Festival, run by the Campaign for Real Ale (CAMRA) and featuring over 30 beers and a barbecue in Glossop\\'s Labour Club.\\n\\nIn recent years, Glossop has become quite well known musically for staging jazz and world music festivals. \\n\\nGlossop has a range of other cultural activities including Peak Film Society, a film club. Many other activities, including Glossop Folk Club take place at Glossop Labour Club. Also at Glossop Labour Club is the monthly Glossop Record Club, which holds vinyl listening sessions on the second Thursday of each month.\\n\\nGlossop has a thriving indoor and outdoor market where a wide selection of goods can be purchased. The indoor market is open every Thursday, Friday and Saturday, while the outdoor market is open every Friday and Saturday. The Outdoor Market is joined by the Local Produce Market on the 2nd Saturday of every month throughout the year.\\n\\nThe Crown Inn public house at 142 Victoria Street, built in the 1840s, is on the Campaign for Real Ale\\'s National Inventory of Historic Pub Interiors.\\n\\nSection::::Emergency service provision.\\nCalls for service in the rural areas usually increase during the summer as the population is boosted by approximately twenty million visitors each year to the Peak District and its surrounds. Winter weather on the high ground around Glossop and Kinder Scout can also cause problems for traffic and residents.\\n\\nState healthcare is provided for in Glossop and District by Tameside and Glossop Clinical Commissioning Group. This NHS trust operates Tameside General Hospital, a foundation hospital, in Ashton-under-Lyne. The Commissioning Group serves two separate communities because there are no district general hospitals (hospitals with Accident and Emergency Department) within the borough of High Peak, and patients would have to travel over 20 miles to another hospital within the county.\\nThe North West Ambulance Service, and occasionally the East Midlands Ambulance Service, provides emergency medical services for the town from its Chapel Street Ambulance Station.\\n\\nWhen Glossop was granted Municipal Borough Status in 1867, the Watch Committee elected to implement its own police force. Glossop Police remained independent until 1947 when they amalgamated with the Derbyshire Constabulary. The police station on Ellison Street is staffed by statutory police officers from B Division of Derbyshire Constabulary. It has a custody suite, five cells and an incident room. There are also a team of volunteer special constables and six police community support officers.\\n\\nGeneral fire and rescue cover is provided by the Derbyshire Fire and Rescue Service. Specialised search and rescue services are provided by the volunteer Glossop Mountain Rescue Team, part of the Peak District Mountain Rescue Organisation. Their remit is to \\'save lives in the mountains and moorlands\\'.\\n\\n<br>\\nSection::::Twin town.\\nBad Vilbel is a spa town in the Wetteraukreis district of Hesse, Germany, northeast of Frankfurt.\\n\\nIn 1985 the Glossop–Bad Vilbel Twinning Association was established. Its aims are:\\n\\nTo promote and foster friendship and understanding between the people of Glossop and district and those of Bad Vilbel and district in Germany.\\n\\nTo encourage visits by individuals and groups to and from the linked towns, particularly by children and young people, and the development of personal contacts, and by doing so to broaden the mutual understanding of the cultural, recreational, educational and commercial activities of the linked towns.\\nIn 1987 formal twinning ceremonies were held in both towns, with a tree being planted in Norfolk Square. The Twinning Association arranges for visitors to stay with families.\\nThe two signatories of the charter were Cllr Catherine Holtom, the Mayor of High Peak, and Herr Gunther Biwer, Bürgermeister of Bad Vilbel.\\n\\nSection::::Literature and the media.\\nHilaire Belloc wrote about Glossop in a letter to a Miss Hamilton in 1909: \"Do you know the filthy village of Glossop? It is inhabited entirely by savages. I tried every inn in the place and found each inn worse than the last. It stinks for miles. Rather than sleep in such a den I started walking back to Manchester with a huge bag...\"\\n\\nGlossop is mentioned in the satirical book \"England, Their England\" by A. G. Macdonell. The town\\'s fictional newspaper, the \"Glossop Evening Mail\", is described as the lowest rung in the journalistic profession.\\n\\nThe television comedy \"The League of Gentlemen\" is filmed in neighbouring Hadfield. Students from Glossopdale Community College have appeared as extras in two shows. In one they were the audience to the Legz Akimbo theatre group in a play about homosexuality, and in the second they appeared as German students on an exchange program with their teacher, Herr Lipp. In 2013, Old Glossop was used for filming in the BBC drama series \"The Village\", starring John Simm and Maxine Peake. The Parish Church of All Saints and the former Duke of Norfolk school building appeared in the series.\\n\\nLocal media includes the \"Glossop Advertiser\" newspaper owned by the \"Manchester Evening News\", the \"Glossop Chronicle\", the \"Buxton Advertiser\", the \"Glossop Gazette\", Glossop Community Radio and High Peak Radio.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Glossop', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113553', 'cat_id': '113553', 'cat_title': 'Drake_Bell_albums', 'cat_pages': '5', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '-RhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11356093', 'text': 'Volodymyr Yavorivsky\\n\\nVolodymyr Oleksandrovych Yavorivsky () is a Ukrainian poet, writer, journalist and politician.\\n\\nSection::::Biography.\\nBorn in 1942 in Crijopol raion of Jugastru county (today part of Vinnytsia Oblast), Yavorivsky graduated from the Odessa State University as a specialist on \"Ukrainian language and literature\".

BSAVE copies RAM to a binary file, and BLOAD copies the contents of the file to RAM. The term \"BSAVE image\" could mean any of various raw image formats of video display controllers, or more generally any file containing the raw contents of a section of memory.\\n\\nSome platforms provided a BRUN command that, after loading the file into memory, would immediately attempt to execute it as machine code.\\n\\nThere is no file compression, and therefore these files load very quickly and without much programming when displayed in native mode.\\n\\nBSAVE files were in general use as a file format when the IBM PC was introduced. It was also in general use on the Apple II in the same time period. Although the commands were available on the Commodore PET line, they were removed from the later (and more popular) Commodore 64 and VIC-20 computers. In 1985 the Commodore 128 was released with Commodore BASIC version 7.0 which restored the BSAVE and BLOAD commands.\\n\\nSection::::Origin.\\nThe BASIC programming language was shipped as part of the operating system on the first IBM PCs, Apple and Commodore 8-bit (like Commodore 64/128) computers. On computers that did not start up in BASIC, BASIC was loaded by manually running the BASIC interpreter. The user could then type BASIC commands in direct mode or by creating and/or running a numbered BASIC program within the interpreter.\\n\\nOne of the commands that early BASIC offered was BSAVE (Binary Save) and another (complementary) command was BLOAD (Binary Load). Using the BSAVE command, an addressable area and length of memory could be saved to disk as a named file (referred to as an \"Image\"). This \"Image\" of saved memory could then be reloaded from disk into addressable memory later with the BLOAD command. If the BSAVEd image contained program code it could be executed, if data it could be used again, and if the BSAVEd image contained graphics it could be viewed. The video area of memory was addressable.\\n\\nThe PUT and GET commands were used in addition to the BSAVE and BLOAD commands on the IBM PC to allow \"clips\" of the screen (or the entire screen) to be pre-formatted for BSAVE and BLOAD. These commands added image height and width to the BSAVE format, and were later carried over into the C programming language by some compiler vendors for the MS-DOS platform as the putimage() and getimage() run-time library functions. PUT and GET allowed display modifier verbs which resembled functions in the Windows Graphical Device Interface (GDI) used by programmers later.\\n\\nMicrosoft produced the BASIC interpreters that were bundled with the IBM PC, Apple II, and Commodore PET, and included the ability to BSAVE and BLOAD RAM images on all 3 platforms.\\n\\nSection::::Historical use.\\nIt was possible for computer users of the day (most who knew how to program in BASIC to some degree) to use the BLOAD command to load a graphics image that had been BSAVED in addition to loading a BSAVED executable or data image.\\n\\nMost early drawing programs allowed their graphics images to be BSAVED, making them easily available by an average user to be BLOADED back into video memory and viewed in a simple external program written in BASIC.\\n\\nCommon use of BSAVED images in graphics programs continued well into the 1990s but their use was primarily limited to users of programs like the freeware program PicEM and the Shareware program VGACAD (which saved the MCGA display to a BSAVED file format called BLD BLoaDablepicture), and by beginning programmers and enthusiasts.\\n\\nWith the passing of MS-DOS so did the use of DOS programs that saved in the BSAVED format.\\nTheir use by programmers has stopped because the BLOAD command is no longer supported in modern programming languages which discourage accessing video memory directly.\\n\\nSection::::Video images.\\nThe BSAVED format is a device-dependent raster image format; the file header sometimes stores information about the display hardware address, and the size of the graphics data.\\nThe graphics data follows the header directly and is stored as raw data in the format of the native adapter\\'s addressable memory.\\n\\nNo additional information, such as screen resolution, color depth and palette information, bit planes and so on, is stored. Video adapters were simple when this format was in wide use and the other information necessary to display the image could usually be inferred by programs that loaded such files.\\n\\nSection::::IBM PC compatible.\\nSection::::CGA.\\nCGA memory starts at memory segment B800h offset 0. Up to 16K of memory is available for video.\\n\\nThe amount of memory used for display depends on the video mode selected. A graphics screen requires 16000 bytes of memory and an 80 x 25 text screen requires 4000 bytes. A 40 x 25 text screen requires 2000 bytes.\\n\\nThe 3 common video modes are monochrome graphics, 4-color graphics or 80 column x 25 row color text.\\n\\nA low-resolution 160 x 100 x 16 color graphics mode unofficially called \"XCGA\" and not supported in BIOS (interrupt 10h) also existed and had limited popularity amongst enthusiasts for a while. Technically this mode worked like color text mode. (see Color Graphics Adapter.)\\n\\n40 column text mode was not generally used for BSAVED images.\\n\\nSection::::CGA text.\\n80 column text is stored in 4 pages of 4000 bytes each. Generally only page 1 was used for BSAVED text images. Each character in an 80 column x 25 row text screen is stored in a contiguous byte array of character, attribute pairs of 2 bytes per text character. The attribute byte stores the foreground color in the low nibble and the background color and blink attribute in the high nibble. The colors 0-16 correspond to the colors offered in text mode by the CGA.\\n\\nThese could be cross-loaded to a low-end monochrome text video display with only 4K of memory with varying degrees of success since the color attributes on monochrome displayed differently.\\n\\nThe file extension that became popular for the BSaved text screen format was .BSV.\\n\\nIn the BBS days before the Internet was widely used, many sysops used a program called TheDraw from TheSoft Programming Services in Fremont, CA as the tool-of-choice to design and build user interface screens. Programmers used TheDraw to design text-based user interfaces, or to edit screens that had been captured from other text programs, and then often would display these edited screens in their own programs, or as slideshows for proof-of-concept and so-forth. TheDraw saved in various formats including BSAVED with the default file extension of .BSV.\\n\\nSection::::Header.\\nThe following C language source code documents the header and tailer in a BSAVED text image:\\nSection::::Example.\\nBy contrast the following tiny GWBASIC program demonstrates how easy it was to load these in BASIC.\\n\\nSection::::Graphics.\\nThe CGA video card (and other IBM PC video cards which support CGA which until recently were almost all) has two interleafs when in monochrome or 4-color Graphics mode. Visible memory is 16,000 bytes. There is 192 bytes of unused data between the first and second interleaf, and 192 bytes of unused data following the second interleaf. The byte array is identical for either mode.\\n\\nSection::::Typical variations.\\nFile Size 16,392 bytes\\nHeader Size 7 bytes\\nFirst Interleaf 8000 bytes\\nUnused 192 Bytes\\nSecond Interleaf 8000 bytes\\nUnused 192 Bytes\\nTailer Size 1 byte\\n\\nVariations on the above include a smaller BSaved file format that does not load the unused memory after the second interleaf, nor the traditional trailer byte 0x1a (CPM EOF). This resulted in a slight saving of disk space.\\n\\nFile Size 16,199 bytes\\nHeader Size 7 bytes\\nFirst Interleaf 8000 bytes\\nUnused 192 Bytes\\nSecond Interleaf 8000 bytes\\n\\nA variation of the BSAVED CGA Image used by the earliest version of PCPaint stored a signature followed by a 2 byte palette index in the unused area directly following the first interleaf.\\n\\nBSAVED CGA images were usually saved with a .PIC extension.\\n\\nSection::::Pixel data.\\nMonochrome data is stored as 1 bit per pixel with pixel(0,0) (x,y) being the high bit in the first byte and pixel(0,7) being the low bit in the first byte. The horizontal resolution for a monochrome CGA image is 640 pixels.\\n\\nColor data is stored as 2 bits per pixel with pixel(0,0) (x,y) being the 2 highest bits in the first byte and pixel(0,3) being the 2 lowest bit in the first byte. The horizontal resolution for a monochrome CGA image is 640 pixels. The nominal color values are either BLACK, CYAN, MAGENTA, WHITE or BLACK, GREEN, RED, and ORANGE in color order depending on which of the two palettes was selected, with variations on border color (color 0). A third palette was available on some cards as well with nominal values of BLACK, CYAN, RED, WHITE. The horizontal resolution for a monochrome CGA image is 320 pixels.\\n\\nThe interleaf breaks on 80 byte boundaries which means that byte[80] is displayed starting at pixel(2,0), and conversely byte[8192] is displayed starting at pixel(1,0), and so it goes. Both color and monochrome have a vertical resolution of 200 scanlines.\\n\\nSection::::Cross-loading.\\nBecause the monochrome and color images could be cross-loaded, a color image displayed in monochrome would be naturally dithered because of the bit alteration provided by the bit pairs in colors 1 and 2. Color 0 was still BLACK and color 3 was still WHITE. This dithering was fairly good for printouts of color images on the black-and-white printers of the day.\\nMonochrome images displayed in color did not do so well. The aliasing of pixels that were not paired on bit boundaries created CYAN and MAGENTA anomalies which usually looked terrible.\\n\\nSection::::Header.\\nThe following C language source code documents the header and tailer in a BSAVED graphics image:\\nSection::::Example.\\nThe following GWBASIC program shows by how easy it was to load and save these in BASIC. It loads an existing image, draws a border around it and saves it.\\nSection::::XCGA low-resolution graphics.\\nThe Color Graphics Adapter page elsewhere on Wikipedia calls this mode \"The 160×100 16 color mode\".\\n\\nXCGA mode as it was known as in the late 1980s enjoyed a brief notoriety amongst enthusiasts but never served any practical purpose because it was too coarse for even for the primitive graphics of the day.\\n\\nEven so, computers equipped only with a CGA video adapter were still prevalent, with users who wanted to display graphics in more than the 4 color maximum that CGA graphics offered.\\n\\nXCGA images were generally created by reducing images produced in higher resolution to a lower resolution facsimile by the use of file conversion software. This was generally done by enthusiasts as more of a novelty than for any real purpose.\\n\\nBSAVED XCGA Images were usually saved with a .CGX extension.\\n\\nSection::::Memory.\\nThe memory on XCGA was a contiguous byte array (just like MCGA mode) and was not interleaved like other CGA graphics modes. It started at memory segment B800 like all CGA video memory, and displaying the first 16,000 bytes of the segment.\\n\\nSection::::Header.\\nThe BSAVED image header was the same as the other CGA BSAVED headers, but the data length was 16000.\\n\\nSection::::Pixel data.\\nPixels were in a raw format, arranged in pixel pairs called \"big pixels\" with 2 bytes per each 2 pixel-color pair stored in a contiguous byte array of 8000 big pixels.\\n\\nSince XCGA was technically a color text mode, the first byte in a big pixel was actually the top two scanlines of a \"text graphics\" character in video ROM. As in color text mode the second byte stored the foreground color in the low nibble and the background color in the high nibble. (see Color Graphics Adapter.)\\n\\nThe colors 0-16 correspond to the colors offered in text mode, and also to those offered by the EGA in its 16-color graphic modes.\\n\\nBy selecting the appropriate 2 pixel text block graphics character from the video ROM, even though the technical resolution was 80 x 100, the effective resolution was 160 x 100. Figure 2 above uses the same graphics character normally used in an XCGA image to display a graphic in standard color text mode\\n\\nEach scanline was 160 bytes long.\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nThe following QuickBasic source code shows how a low resolution BSAVED Image with 16 Colors was displayed. The commands are the same as displaying BSAVE images in standard CGA graphics or text modes with the addition of setting of registers on the CGA\\'s MC6845 CRT controller.\\nSection::::EGA and VGA.\\nBSAVE images using multiple color planes and color registers were not common but they did exist.\\n\\nAdditional program code was needed to save and display these which was more complicated than the average user of the day could easily write. The EGA was relatively expensive, and typically used for high-end workstations; by the time low-cost VGA cards came out fewer users experimented with BASIC, and anyway usually preferred to use the lower-resolution 256-color MCGA mode.\\n\\nSection::::MCGA.\\nMulti-Color Graphics Array (MCGA) had two additional video modes beyond CGA. BSAVE images using 256 colors and color palettes were not common but they did exist.\\n\\nThe MCGA was organized in one contiguous byte array of 64,000 bytes each with a value of 0–255, and each representing a pixel. Loading and saving these was virtually the same as the CGA Bsaved format with the difference being that additional program code was needed to save and restore the color palettes.\\n\\nTwo MS-DOS based utilities, PICEm and VGACad, offered saving of BSAVE MCGA images, with the latter also offering a BSAVE-style palette save. VGACad used the file extensions .BLD (BLoaDablePicture) and .PLT.\\n\\nThe color palette was most easily saved with some understanding of the graphics card\\'s registers. If the programmer did put effort into this, it usually was not very long before that understanding extended to more capable languages than BASIC and more advanced graphics formats than the BSAVE format.\\n\\nSection::::Example.\\nThe following QuickBASIC program shows how to load these in BASIC. The amount of code is substantially larger than in the CGA equivalent.\\n\\nSection::::Apple II.\\nSection::::Low-resolution graphics (GR).\\nThe Apple II had two \"low resolution\" (lo-res) graphics screen pages which allowed the simultaneous display of 16 colors at a very coarse resolution (40 x 48). This display mode was really too coarse for \"meaningful\" graphics display although Apple computer provided an excellent kaleidescope demo called \"Rod\\'s Color Pattern\" to promote its use. Further, since this area of memory (also shared with the text display) was non-contiguous and the Apple II made use of the \"memory holes\" at the sides of the display for other purposes like mouse support, it was not practical to \"BLoad\" previously saved graphics images because they would \"clobber\" these \"memory holes\" that may be required for other processes.\\n\\nSection::::High-resolution graphics (HGR).\\nThe Apple II had two \"high-resolution\" graphics screen pages: \"page 1\" (occupying the 8 kB of memory beginning at 0x2000) and \"page 2\" (immediately following at 0x4000). It also had two commonly used \"high-resolution\" graphics modes: \"graphics only\" (\"pure\" graphics mode) and \"mixed text and graphics\" (only offering a partial display of a graphics image with the bottom 4 lines of the respective text \"page 1\" or \"page 2\" at the bottom, leaving only the first 160 lines of the graphics screen visible).\\n\\nThe Apple II \"high-resolution\" (hi-res) graphics mode could be invoked from AppleSoft BASIC with the HGR and HGR2 commands. HGR enabled hi-res page 1 (occupying the 8 kB of memory beginning at 0x2000) with the bottom 4 lines of text page 1 at the bottom. HGR2 enabled hi-res page 2 (immediately following at 0x4000) with no text area showing. A POKE command could be used to independently enable or disable the text area on either page—though text page 2 was rarely used in BASIC, and BASIC programs normally loaded into its memory.\\n\\nWhen ProDOS SYS programs were introduced (written in programming languages other than BASIC; like Assembler, C or Pascal) it was common to use \"page 2\" graphics only because SYS programs loaded at 0x2000 which conflicted with \"page 1\".\\n\\nSection::::Resolution.\\nThe resolution of an Apple II hi-res graphics screen was 280 pixels x 192 rasters and allowed (on very early Apple II\\'s) up to 4 colors to be displayed simultaneously. The hardware generated color by exploiting the nature of composite color video, essentially fooling the monitor into interpreting color from the pixel positions of an otherwise monochrome bitmap. This frugal design kept the hardware simple, but led to limitations as to what colors could be adjacent to each other on a line.\\nFurthermore, as of the second version of the Apple II (non-plus) motherboard (also very early-on), horizontal groups of 7 pixels could be shifted by one half pixel, allowing 2 more colors (and a redundant white and black). The new colors and the original colors could not coexist within the same 7 pixel group.\\n\\nAlthough not invented as a memory saving measure, the Apple II display design allowed a 6 color image to be displayed in only 8K of video memory despite the fact that colors would \"bleed\" (artifact) into each other if the pixels were incompatibly arranged. \\n\\nSection::::File format.\\nThe 8 kB hi-res frame buffer (like all 8-bit Apple II video modes), due to another logic chip conserving idiosyncrasy, was interleaved, and in blocks of 128 bytes, with 8 byte non-displayed \"holes\" in between. Under Apple DOS all binary files had a header of 4 bytes (2 integers representing the address and length of the save). However, since one of the holes was at the very end of the buffer, it could safely be omitted from the save, keeping the entire package inside of 8 kB (with 4 bytes to spare), which avoided the file taking another 256 byte block just for those 4 bytes of metadata. Under ProDOS the metadata is stored in the directory entry, so is not even an issue.\\n\\nVarious prefixes and suffices (such as \"PIC\", \"HPIC\", or \"HGR\") were used to indicate that the file was a graphics screen save. ProDOS had a special \"fotofile\" filetype (inherited from Apple SOS) of identical format. Unfortunately awareness of it was low, and few programs supported it.\\n\\nSection::::Rasters (scanlines).\\nThe rasters in an Apple II BSAVED image are not contiguous, nor are they in a simple sequential order. They match the video memory on the Apple II which was relatively complicated, and are arranged as follows:\\n\\nEach scanline is 40 bytes long. There are 3 parent interleaves of 64 scanlines each. Starting at the beginning of the image file, scanlines are arranged in 128 byte blocks beginning with scanlines 0, 64, and 128 in the first block (see table below). 8 bytes at the end of each block are unused by the image.\\n\\nEach parent interleaf has 8 child interleaves of 8 scanlines each, with a spacing of 1024 bytes (1K) between sequential scanlines in each of the 3 parent interleaves.\\n\\nStarting at the beginning of the file and respective of the Apple II\\'s interleaved display, the first 8 of the 128 byte blocks run as shown below. This also represents the first of 8 scanlines in each of the 24 child interleaves, and is effectively a block group. 8 of these block groups are stored in the file, with the scanlines in the table below being incremented by 1 for each subsequent block group sequence of 1024 bytes, totalling 8192 bytes (8K) of graphics image data.\\n\\nBecause of the interleaved display and the slow processor speed of the Apple II, when these loaded, a visible \"venetian blind\" effect was produced creating a \"wipe\" (fade effect) of the previous graphic if any.\\n\\nSection::::Pixels (colors).\\nThe colors in an Apple II BSAVED image are Black, Green, Violet, Orange, Blue, and White. Pixel color is represented by 2 bits. Although the nominal resolution is 280 x 192, the effective resolution considering colors is really only 140 x 192.\\n\\nIn a 40 byte scanline pixels are stored in an bit array of 280 pixel positions referred to as \"columns\". The highest bit of each byte is used as a \"palette\" bit and is not considered a column. The lowest bit represents the first column in the byte. So a scan line beginning with $03 would have the first two pixel positions set as white (with the next 5 pixels black).\\n\\nIf the palette bit in a byte is set, the 4 colors available for the pixels in that byte are black, blue, orange, and white.\\n\\nIf the palette bit is not set, the 4 colors available for the pixels in that byte are black, violet, green, and white\\n\\nIgnoring the 40 palette bits in a 40 byte scanline, there are 280 columns (bits, pixel positions) but only 140 available pixels. So considering each pixel as being a column pair, with an even and odd column, from left to right starting at column 0, if even is set and odd is not set, the pixel is blue or violet. If even is not set and odd is set, the pixel is orange or green. Any two adjacent columns that are set will be white. This means that white pixels (and black pixels) can be positioned at more places than the other colors, but does not alter the fact that the effective resolution is really only 140 x 192 for an Apple II BSAVED image.\\n\\nSection::::BLOAD example.\\nTo BLOAD a previously BSAVED image, use the Apple DOS/ProDOS command:\\n\\nThe following AppleSoft BASIC program loads a BSAVED Apple II Graphics Screen under Apple DOS 3.3. First it clears the screen, lists a directory, waits for user input (the BSAVED screen name) and then loads the screen and waits for a keypress, and repeats until the user ends the program.\\nSection::::BSAVE example.\\nTo BSAVE the HGR screen (starting at memory location $2000, for a length of $1FF8) use the Apple DOS/ProDOS command:\\nTo BSAVE the HGR2 screen (starting at memory location $4000, for a length of $1FF8) use the Apple DOS/ProDOS command:\\n\\nSection::::Commodore 64 and 128.\\nThe sample screens shown above were converted from the 4 Color BSAVED Image in Figure 1:. Due to the lower resolutions in both the Commodore\\'s standard native graphics display modes, Figure 6: sacrifices colors to black and white where needed during conversion resulting in color loss. The colors remain intact when converting to the lower resolution 4 color mode, but some detail is lost.\\n\\nSection::::Graphics.\\nStrictly speaking all the uncompressed Graphics File Formats on the Commodore 64 (C64) and 128 (C128) (and there were many) were in a variation of the BSAVE graphics image format because the Commodore stored all binary files (including Graphics) with a two-byte header which provided the file\\'s originating load address. However, because most of these could not be BLoaded directly into the video areas of the C128 they really are a little too advanced to be considered as BSaved graphics images in the same context as on the IBM-PC and Apple II computers of the same vintage.\\n\\nC64\\'s did not provide a BSAVE nor a BLOAD command with their version of the Commodore BASIC language (Version 2). It was not until the release of Commodore BASIC 7 on the C128 that the BSAVE and BLOAD commands and the BSAVE graphics image format came into existence on the C128.\\n\\nC64\\'s BASIC did provide a LOAD command which was intended to LOAD binary program files, data files, and BASIC programs, but this command when used in a C64 BASIC program to load binary data files like BSAVE images needed to restart the BASIC program after the (\"non-relocating\") load.\\n\\nThis lack of support for loading binary data files from a BASIC program without restarting the program itself amounted to a very serious shortcoming in C64 BASIC Version 2 (later corrected by the C128\\'s BLOAD command) which left the C64 user with the option writing a program that could be restarted after the (\"non-relocating\") load, or the option of slowly reading binary data files one byte at a time, and then moving the data to memory one byte at a time with data conversion further slowing-down the process.\\n\\nTechnically the standard HIRES graphics mode on the C128 was the same as on the C64 except that the default address in RAM where videoram (HIRES colors) are stored on the C128 directly preceded the default screen address (unlike the C64). This made loading a single BSAVE graphic file in either a monochrome or color format (of the uncompressed type produced by DOODLE) possible on the C128.\\n\\nSection::::Resolution and pixel blocks.\\nThe two primary graphics mode resolutions that both the C64 and C128 shared were 320 x 200 (HIRES) and 160 x 200 (Multi-Color Mode). Both modes provided selection of colors from a standard built-in palette of colors.\\n\\nIn HIRES mode, the screen was broken-down in blocks of 8 pixels x 8 scanlines. Pixels of two colors from the 16 color palette could be displayed in each block.\\n\\nIn Multi-Color Mode, the screen was broken down in blocks of 4 pixels x 8 scanlines. Pixels of 4 colors from the 16 color palette could be displayed in each block.\\n\\nHowever, because only 2 colors could be stored in the standard memory area shared by HIRES mode, a separate area of RAM was used to store the other two colors which was not contiguous with the default screen address and which was fixed (even the C128). This meant that a separate BSAVE file containing the remaining 2 colors was required to BSAVE and BLOAD these on the C128 (keeping in mind that the C64 did not support the BSaved format).\\n\\nThis is somewhat similar to the loading of multiple BSaved files on the IBM PC\\'s EGA, VGA, and MCGA Modes discussed above.\\n\\nSection::::File format.\\nThe size of a HIRES Monochrome BSAVE image without the two byte header was 8000 bytes (the same size as visible screen memory), and was \"linearized\". The many file extensions possible included .HIR and .HBM, if a file extension was used at all.\\n\\nThe size of a HIRES Color BSAVE image (of the uncompressed type produced by DOODLE) was 9024 bytes (the same size as videoram plus visible screen memory) without the two byte header, and was \"linearized\". The file extension was .DD, if a file extension was used at all.\\n\\nOther variations of HIRES and even Multi-Color BSaved formats could be produced from compatible graphics formats by splitting them into uncompressed pieces with BLoadable addresses. If a split graphics image was used it was generally split into an 8000 byte bitmap and 1000 byte videoram (2 colors) for HIRES mode, and with a third file, a 1000 byte colorram (2 colors), for Multi-Color Mode.\\n\\nLike all BIN (Binary) files on the C64 and C128, the files had a binary header of 2 bytes (1 integer). The header gave the load address for the file, and the length was already known to BASIC 7. The default load addresses on the C128 were $2000, $1C00, and $D800 for bitmap, videoram, and colorram respectively.\\n\\nGenerally speaking, the popular uncompressed Multi-Color (4 Color) formats produced by the Paintbrush programs of the day could not be BLoaded without splitting them (in a separate program) and performing an additional operation of putting a background color which was stored elsewhere in the originating file into the 1000 high-nibbles of colorram.\\n\\nSince the screen address on the C64 and C128 was relocatable, the screen address could be detected and used by the loader program when BLoading these split files.\\n\\nSection::::Rasters (scanlines).\\nThe rasters in a C128 BSAVED image are not contiguous, but are in a simple sequential order of pixel blocks (as noted above). They match the video memory on the C128 which in its standard modes was uncomplicated except for its pixel block orientation.\\n\\nBecause of the slow processor speed of the C128 combined with slow storage access, when a HIRES image loaded it was displayed in 25 passes of 40 chunks creating a choppy effect. If the HIRES image had colors it was often blurry and not recognizable since the colors loaded after the image was already being displayed leaving the user with nothing to do but wait until it was finished.\\n\\nSection::::Pixels (colors).\\nThe standard available colors in a C128 image are BLACK, WHITE, RED, CYAN,\\nPURPLE, GREEN, BLUE, YELLOW, ORANGE, BROWN, LIGHT RED,DARK GREY,MEDIUM GREY,LIGHT GREEN, LIGHT BLUE,and LIGHT GREY. Pixel color is represented by 2 bits in HIRES mode and 4 bits in Multi Color Mode. But as indicated above, not all 16 Colors can be displayed in a pixel block.\\n\\nSection::::BLOAD equivalent example on C64.\\nThe BLOAD command did not exist on the C64. Instead a BASIC program could use a \"non-relocating\" LOAD command to load BSAVED Graphics if it was designed to restart after the load, as demonstrated in the following Commodore BASIC 2 program. It loads a colored BSAVED HIRES Graphics Screen on the C64 from 2 separate BSaved Files (a split image), waits for a keypress and ends.\\n\\nThe load address in the 2 files of $2000 for bitmap and $400 for videoram respectively are in the file headers and are used by the LOAD command to read the files directly into the C64\\'s RAM.\\n\\nCompared to BASIC 7 on the C128 (see C128 examples also below), the C64\\'s BASIC 2 was somewhat less straightforward.\\n\\nA second (and slower) alternative shown below which does not require a program restart is to open the BSAVED Graphic as a file. The program example below is functionally the same as the one above.\\n\\nSection::::BLOAD example on C128.\\nThe following Commodore BASIC 7 program loads a codice_1d high-resolution monochrome graphics screen on the C128, then sets each of the colors for the 1000 pixel blocks to black and white, waits for a keypress, and ends. No colors are stored in the image. The image is loaded at the start of the high-resolution screen, $2000.\\n\\nThe following Commodore BASIC 7 program loads a codice_1d high-resolution color graphics screen in DOODLE! uncompressed format on the C128, waits for a keypress, and ends. The image is loaded at the start of the 128\\'s high-resolution color RAM, at $1C00, directly before the high-resolution graphics screen, at $2000. No color setting is required, since the colors are stored in the image.\\n\\nThe following Commodore BASIC 7 program loads a codice_1d multicolor 4-color graphics screen in 3 separate codice_1d files (a split image) on the C128, waits for a keypress, and ends. The three files are loaded at $2000 for the bitmap, $1C00 for colors 1 and 2, and $D800 in codice_5 15 for color 3. No color setting is required.\\n\\nSection::::Bitmap converter example.\\nThe following C language source code is part of a Windows Program written in Microsoft C and the WIN32 SDK. It demonstrates how a monochrome bitmap in a standard format can be reorganized to display as a BSaved Image on the Commodore 128 (C128).\\n\\nPrograms that convert bitmaps with colors to a C128 HIRES or Multi-Color compatible format use the same basic logic as the example below, with additional logic to organize the color map. Under Windows on the IBM PC these converted images can then be inserted into C128 \"disk images\" used by C128 emulators and loaded by programs similar to the C128 Basic 7 programs shown above.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'BSAVE', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11367664'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': '_xhR_GoBH77kAisjAZe3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11369828', 'text': 'USS Fair (DE-35)\\n\\nUSS \"Fair\" (DE-35) an Evarts-class destroyer escort of the United States Navy, was a ship named by the United States Navy for Lieutenant, junior grade Victor Norman Fair, Jr., who was born on 15 August 1921 in Lincoln County, North Carolina, enlisted in the Naval Reserve on 15 August 1940, and was commissioned ensign on 14 March 1941.

She put to sea nine days later to conduct an antisubmarine patrol off Tarawa, and late on 4 February, joined to develop a contact previously made by the destroyer. Attacks by both ships led to the sinking of what was probably Japanese submarine I-175 the next morning. \"Fair\" returned to Pearl Harbor on 17 February, and sailed on 25 February for Majuro, where from 5 March – 12 June, she patrolled the entrance to the lagoon, and escorted ships to and from ocean rendezvous and Roi Namur.

She returned to Pearl Harbor on 31 August for a brief overhaul and to take part in training operations.

Raisins are produced in many regions of the world and may be eaten raw or used in cooking, baking, and brewing. In the United Kingdom, Ireland, New Zealand, and Australia, the word \"raisin\" is reserved for the dark-colored dried large grape, with \"sultana\" being a golden-colored dried grape, and \"currant\" being a dried small Black Corinth seedless grape.\\n\\nSection::::Etymology.\\nThe word \"raisin\" dates back to Middle English and is a loanword from Old French; in modern French, \"raisin\" means \"grape\", while a dried grape is a \"raisin sec\", or \"dry grape\". The Old French word, in turn, developed from the Latin word \"\", \"a bunch of grapes\".\\n\\nSection::::Varieties.\\nRaisin varieties depend on the type of grape used and are made in a variety of sizes and colors including green, black, brown, blue, purple, and yellow. Seedless varieties include the sultana (the common American type is known as Thompson Seedless in the United States), the Greek currants (black corinthian raisins,\" Vitis vinifera \"L. var. Apyrena) and Flame grapes. Raisins are traditionally sun-dried, but may also be water-dipped and artificially dehydrated.\\n\\n\"Golden raisins\" are generally dried in dehydrators with controlled temperature and humidity, which allows them to retain a lighter color and more moisture. They are often treated with sulfur dioxide after drying.\\n\\nBlack Corinth or Zante currant are miniature, sometimes seedless raisins that are much darker and have a tart, tangy flavor. They are often called currants. Muscat raisins are large compared to other varieties, and also sweeter.\\n\\nSeveral varieties of raisins produced in Asia are available in the West only at ethnic grocers. Monukka grapes are used for some of these.\\n\\nSection::::Nutrition.\\nRaisins can contain up to 72% sugars by weight, most of which is fructose and glucose – forming sucrose when combined in a single molecule. They also contain about 3% protein and 3.7%–6.8% dietary fiber. Raisins, like prunes and apricots, are also high in certain antioxidants, but have a lower vitamin C content than fresh grapes. Raisins are low in sodium and contain no cholesterol.\\n\\nData presented at the American College of Cardiology\\'s 61st Annual Scientific Session in 2012 suggest that, among individuals with mild increases in blood pressure, the routine consumption of raisins (three times a day) may significantly lower blood pressure, especially when compared to eating other common snacks.\\n\\nSection::::Toxicity in pets.\\nRaisins can cause renal failure in dogs. The cause of this is not known.\\n\\nSection::::Sugars.\\nRaisins are sweet due to their high concentration of sugars (about 30% fructose and 28% glucose by weight). The sugars can crystallise inside the fruit when stored after a long period, making the dry raisins gritty, but that does not affect their usability. These sugar grains can be dissolved by blanching the fruit in hot water or other liquids.\\n\\nSection::::Raisin production.\\nGlobal production in 2016 was 1.2 million metric tons, with the US as the top producer contributing 24% of the global harvest.\\n\\nRaisins are produced commercially by drying harvested grape berries. For a grape berry to dry, water inside the grape must be removed completely from the interior of the cells onto the surface of the grape where the water droplets can evaporate. However, this diffusion process is very difficult because the grape skin contains wax in its cuticle, which prevents the water from passing through. In addition to this, the physical and chemical mechanisms located on the outer layers of the grape are adapted to prevent water loss.\\n\\nThe three steps to commercial raisin production include pre-treatment, drying, and post-drying processes.\\n\\nSection::::Pre-treatment.\\nPre-treatment is a necessary step in raisin production to ensure the increased rate of water removal during the drying process. A faster water removal rate decreases the rate of browning and helps to produce more desirable raisins. The historical method of completing this process was developed in the Mediterranean and Asia Minor areas by using a dry emulsion cold dip made of potassium carbonate and ethyl esters of fatty acids. This dip was shown to increase the rate of water loss by two- to three-fold.\\n\\nRecently, new methods have been developed such as exposing the grapes to oil emulsions or dilute alkaline solutions. These methods can encourage water transfer to the outer surface of grapes which helps to increase the efficiency of the drying process.\\n\\nSection::::Drying.\\nThe three types of drying methods are: sun drying, shade drying, and mechanical drying. Sun drying is an inexpensive process; however, environmental contamination, insect infections, and microbial deterioration can occur and the resulting raisins are often of low quality. Additionally, sun drying is a very slow process and may not produce the most desirable raisins.\\n\\nMechanical drying can be done in a safer and more controlled environment where rapid drying is guaranteed. One type of mechanical drying is to use microwave heating. Water molecules in the grapes absorb microwave energy resulting in rapid evaporation. Microwave heating often produces puffy raisins.\\n\\nSection::::Post-drying processes.\\nAfter the drying process is complete, raisins are sent to processing plants where they are cleaned with water to remove any foreign objects that may have become embedded during the drying process. Stems and off-grade raisins are also removed. The washing process may cause rehydration, so another drying step is completed after washing to ensure that the added moisture has been removed.\\n\\nAll steps in the production of raisins are very important in determining the quality of raisins. Sometimes, sulfur dioxide is applied to raisins after the pre treatment step and before drying to decrease the rate of browning caused by the reaction between polyphenol oxidase and phenolic compounds. Sulfur dioxide also helps to preserve flavor and prevent the loss of certain vitamins during the drying process.\\n\\nSection::::Nutrition and health.\\nRaisins are rich in dietary fiber, carbohydrates with a low glycemic index, and minerals like copper and iron, with a low fat content. Raisins are often recommended as a snack for weight control because they help the control of glucose, the good functioning of the digestive system and the regulation of blood pressure.\\n\\nReplacing unhealthy snacks with raisins as a dietary habit has shown positive benefits in patients with type 2 diabetes, including reduced diastolic blood pressure and increased levels of plasma antioxidants.\\n\\nCorinthian raisins are a moderate glycemic index fruit that can be consumed in small amounts even by diabetic patients instead of sweets.\\n\\nAntioxidants in Greek raisins may reduce the risk for malignancies in the stomach and colon.\\n\\nRaisins have one of the highest concentrations of boron in dried food, containing between 2 and 3\\xa0mg per 100\\xa0grams. Boron may be important for maintaining healthy bone and joint quality. It has been shown to disadvantage testosterone synthesis. According to a study published in “Journal of Agricultural and Food Chemistry”, golden raisins have a higher antioxidant capacity than sun-dried black raisins do.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Raisin', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=113723', 'cat_id': '113723', 'cat_title': \"Drexel_Dragons_men's_basketball_coaches\", 'cat_pages': '16', 'cat_subcats': '0', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ARhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1137561', 'text': 'Esh (letter)\\n\\nEsh (majuscule: Ʃ Unicode U+01A9, minuscule: ʃ Unicode U+0283) is a character used in conjunction with the Latin script.

Pelzer represented Germany at youth level and made 130 appearance in the second Bundesliga. As a 15-year-old Pelzer played as left-back for the German National U15 side that played against England U15's in the Olympiastadion (Berlin) in front of 70,000 people, they won 3-0.\\n\\nSection::::Career.\\nBorn in Trier, Pelzer began his career with FSV Salmrohr before joining 1. FC Kaiserslautern as a 16-year-old. He played for the U19's for two years before progressing to their reserve side for three years when he was promoted to first team by Otto Rehhagel who coached the club to the Bundesliga title in 1998. In 2002 he moved to England, signing for Blackburn Rovers. He made his debut as a reserve player before making his first team appearance in the Football League Cup against Walsall. However, injuries were to blight his time at Blackburn and he was unable to make it back into the first team.\\n\\nHe returned to Germany after eighteen months at Ewood Park, joining his hometown club, SV Eintracht Trier 05 who were fighting relegation at the time. Pelzer helped the club back into safety where they finished that season in impressive 11th place. He played here for a season and a half, leaving in 2005 after the club's relegation from the 2. Bundesliga. Despite being linked to A.C. Perugia Calcio, Real Murcia, Hannover 96 and Borussia Mönchengladbach he instead was advised by his agent to make the short journey to 1. FC Saarbrücken, where he played for one season. Despite ambitious plans for promotion with the signing of players such as Mustapha Hadji Saarbrücken suffered relegation, and Pelzer left the club. He then signed for Dynamo Dresden in October 2006, where he became a fans' favourite, and was made captain just two months after signing. The club came close to promotion into the second Bundesliga but faltered late on in the season. Pelzer helped lead the club to success in the Saxony Cup competition of 2007.\\n\\nPelzer left the club in the summer of 2007, with the intention of returning to England following trials with Hull City and Plymouth Argyle. Whilst on trial with Plymouth, manager Ian Holloway indicated he wished to sign the player but Pelzer's agent rejected the terms on the grounds of money, something Pelzer was not aware of at the time. He eventually returned to Dynamo Dresden, after the club had agreed a shirt sponsorship deal, and could afford to sign him. Pelzer was soon made captain again and helped the club qualify for the new third Bundesliga in 2008.\\n\\nHis contract with Dynamo was annulled in January 2009 at his own request. On 12 January 2009 he moved up a league to join Bundesliga 2 side Rot-Weiss Ahlen who had tried to sign the player during the previous summer. On 9 June 2010, he signed a two-year contract with F.C. Hansa Rostock. Pelzer was immediately made captain of the club and was used extensively in the clubs marketing campaign. During the promotion season of 2010-11 Pelzer made 37 league appearances missing just one match through suspension. He also led the club to the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern Cup in 2011. The club made major changes to the promotion winning side, with Pelzer making just 14 league appearances for season. The new team struggled and were eventually relegated after just one season in Bundesliga 2. Pelzer signed a one-year extension to his contract and was back playing regularly in the first team. In 2013 Pelzer suffered a debilitating injury to his toe. Despite this career threatening injury the club extended his contract by two further years with plans to keep Pelzer at the club after his playing career.\\n\\nIn 2015 Pelzer officially retired from playing due to the injury. He's since become a well-known and popular presence in the media appearing in broadcasts in both his native Germany and in England. Pelzer is fluent in English from his time spent playing there.

The film, which was based on the 1932 novel of the same name by John Wells, stars Ginger Rogers, Norman Foster and George Sidney, and features Robert Benchley, Laura Hope Crews and Guinn Williams.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nMary Carroll (Ginger Rogers) is a young woman from upstate who came to New York City to find a job and a career, but whose money has almost run out. Both she and Jack Bacon (Norman Foster), an aspiring artist who lives in the same Greenwich Village building, are behind on their rent and their landlord, Max Eckbaum (George Sidney), a good-natured soul who nevertheless has expenses to meet, comes up with a solution: Move Mary into Jack\\'s loft and have them share the apartment on a shift basis. They would never see each other or know who the other is, since Jack is out all night and sleeps during the day, and Mary is taking a job selling refrigerators by telephone, which keeps her out all day.\\n\\nHowever, both manage to get a very bad impression of each other after realizing the other is of the opposite sex from articles of clothing lying about. A series of misunderstandings leads to a series of pranks aimed at each other: Jack places a bucket in the shower, and when Mary goes in it falls on her head. Then she places Jack\\'s suit in the shower, so that it gets wet. In retaliation, he saws Mary\\'s bed in half so that it would come apart when she sits on it.\\n\\nThe situation gets complicated when the couple accidentally meet outside their apartment and, not knowing who the other is, begin to fall in love. Matters get worse when Mary\\'s boss, lecherous H. Harrington Hubbell (Robert Benchley), tries to invite her out for dinner, while Jack\\'s would-be \"patron\", a lonely, libidinous, rich older woman, Elise Peabody Willington Smythe (Laura Hope Crews), tries to maintain her monopoly over Jack.\\n\\nWhen Jack accompanies Mary to a company picnic, they slip away from the group together and miss the bus back to town, forcing them to take a taxi. When they arrive at Jack\\'s home, Mary realizes that Jack is her roommate. Trying to allay what he assumes are her suspicions about the arrangement, and unaware Mary is the person with whom he has been sharing the attic loft, Jack strongly denounces his co-tenant to her until the landlord comes and explains all.\\n\\nElise and Hubbell also arrive at the apartment, where Elise tries to bribe Mary, while a protective cabdriver, Fritzie (Guinn Williams), punches Hubbell, mistaking him for Jack. Realizing his mistake, Fritzie then goes to his cab where Jack is pleading with Mary. Fritzie is about to punch Jack when Mary intervenes, and the cab drives off with Jack and Mary kissing in the backseat. Asked if they will get married, the landlord says, \"I arranged it.\"\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nProduction on \"Rafter Romance\" began in mid-June 1933. RKO initially announced that Joel McCrea and Dorothy Jordan would star in the film, and then paired Lew Ayres with Ginger Rogers, before casting Norman Foster as the male lead. Foster and Rogers had been teamed before on \"Young Man of Manhattan\" in 1930, and also made \"Professional Sweetheart\" together later in 1933.\\n\\nFour years after the release of \"Rafter Romance\", producer Merian C. Cooper re-made it as \"Living on Love\", with James Dunn and Whitney Bourne, also for RKO. The plots of other films, including the German film \"Ich bei Tag und du bei Nacht\" (1932), the French film \"A Moi le jour, à toi nuit\" (1932) and the British \"Early to Bed\" (1933) have similarities to \"Rafter Romance\", but are actually based on a completely separate screenplay by Robert Liebmann and János Székely.\\n\\nMerian C.

It was one of two successors to the Passport marque, which had a similar intent.\\n\\nPreceding the Asüna marque, Passport sold a Korean (Daewoo) made badge engineered Opel Kadett E known as the Passport Optima (which hit Canadian shores in 1991) as well as a selection of Isuzu cars and SUVs. General Motors Canada changed its branding strategy in 1988, disbanding Passport (the Optima was rebadged for 1992 as Pontiac LeMans). Isuzu was grouped together with Saab and GM\\'s new, import-fighting Saturn division to form Saturn-Saab-Isuzu dealerships. The Geo marque was introduced in Canada in (model year) 1992, offered at Chevrolet-Oldsmobile-Cadillac dealers (who had been selling the Geo (rebadged Suzuki) marque\\'s products as Chevrolets from 1987 until the marque\\'s introduction). Sales of Geo vehicles were relatively successful, prompting Pontiac-Buick-GMC dealers to request GM Canada to provide a lineup of similar \"import\" vehicles. Asüna was created to fulfill this demand. Geo has been terminated for 1998 so the Chevrolet Tracker name was back (as in 89-91) until 2004. Small Metro and Firefly until year 2000. \\n\\nThe Pontiac LeMans model name was dropped altogether in favour of trimline designations, selling as Asüna SE in base trim hatchbacks and sedans, and as Asüna GT as a higher trim hatchback for 1993. The Asüna lineup was rounded out by the 1993 Sunfire (Isuzu Impulse and Geo Storm twin) and 92-93 Sunrunner taking the GMC Tracker\\'s place in the Pontiac-Buick-GMC lineup.\\n\\nAsüna sales could not match Geo\\'s, and the Asüna marque was eliminated for 1994. The SE/GT and Sunfire were dropped from the GM Canada lineup and Sunrunner was rebadged as a Pontiac (94-97). Firefly (Geo Metro) was back in the Pontiac family for 1994 to \"built excitment\" in the sub-compact car segment. \\n', 'title': 'Asüna', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1138558'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11388027', 'text': 'Jay Hopler\\n\\nJay Hopler (born 1970) is an American poet.\\n\\nSection::::Early life and education.\\nHopler was born in San Juan, Puerto Rico.

In Week 17, they recorded the biggest road win in their history against the Cincinnati Bengals.\\n\\nThe season was marked by close losses in which touchdowns had been called back due to referee error.\\n\\nSection::::Game summaries.\\nSection::::Preseason.\\nThe Buccaneers moved out of aging Houlihan\\'s Stadium after the 1997 season. With construction crews still putting the finishing touches on brand new Raymond James Stadium, the Buccaneers were forced to play all of their preseason games on the road. The team opened with a win against Pittsburgh in the Hall of Fame Game, then faced Kansas City in Oklahoma, an ordeal which saw the team sit at the airport nearly all night.\\n\\nAfter another road trip to Miami, the travel started taking a toll on the team. A cross-country trip to Oakland was followed four days later by a game at New Orleans.\\n\\nSection::::Week 1: at Minnesota Vikings.\\nComing off their playoff season from 1997, the Buccaneers opened 1998 with high expectations. Still on the road, their first game in the new stadium would have to wait until week 3. Receiver Bert Emanuel went out with a sprained ankle, and Tampa Bay lost 31–7.\\n\\nSection::::Week 2: at Green Bay Packers.\\nJacques Green returned a punt 95 yards for a touchdown (only his second-career return attempt) to set a franchise record for longest punt return. However, Green Bay won 23–15.\\n\\nSection::::Week 3: Chicago Bears.\\nAfter five games on the road during the preseason, and the first two regular season games played away, the Buccaneers finally were ready for a home game. The highly anticipated first game at brand new Raymond James Stadium saw the Buccaneers host the Bears. After falling behind 15–0 at halftime, Tampa Bay scored 27 unanswered points to win 27–15. Dave Moore caught a one-handed pass for a 44-yard touchdown in the third quarter. In the fourth quarter, Warrick Dunn ran for a 44-yard touchdown. Raymond James Stadium was opened with a victory, and the Buccaneers improved to 1–2.\\n\\nSection::::Week 4: at Detroit Lions.\\nOn Monday Night Football, Tampa Bay faced Detroit at the Silverdome. Despite clinging to a 6–3 deficit at halftime, Tampa Bay’s sputtering offense and defensive miscues cost any chance at victory. Barry Sanders rushed for 131 yards, Bryant Westbrook returned an interception 34 yards for a touchdown, and Terry Fair returned a Lions record 105-yard kickoff return touchdown. Two apparent touchdown passes by Trent Dilfer were called back for penalty, and Tampa Bay fell 27–6.\\n\\nSection::::Week 5: New York Giants.\\nOnly a minute and a half into the game, Charles Mincy intercepted Kanell for a 22-yard touchdown return. Tampa Bay would never trail in the game. The Buccaneer defense held the Giants to only 135 total yards, and picked off Kanell three times in the 20–3 victory.\\n\\nSection::::Week 7: Carolina Panthers.\\nTampa Bay evened their record to 3–3 with a win over Carolina. The Panthers led 13–3 in the fourth quarter, but Trent Dilfer led the Buccaneers for a rally in the final 5 minutes. On a roll out, Dilfer ran in for a 1-yard touchdown, then on the next possession, scored the go-ahead touchdown. Karl Williams caught a 29-yard touchdown pass in the corner of the endzone with 1:39 to go to seal the victory 16–13.\\n\\nThe Buccaneers improved to 3–0 at Raymond James Stadium.\\n\\nSection::::Week 8: at New Orleans Saints.\\nThe Tampa Bay offense dropped seven passes, Patrick Hape lost a fumble at the Saints 3-yard line, and Trent Dilfer threw an interception, as offensive futility again plagued the Buccaneers, resulting in a 9–3 loss at New Orleans. Three times the Buccaneers had the ball inside the Saints 25-yard line, but came up with zero points. At one point, Bert Emanuel caught a touchdown pass, but the officials ruled it incomplete, saying he \"trapped\" the ball against the turf.\\n\\nSection::::Week 9: Minnesota Vikings.\\nThe Vikings entered week 9 at Tampa Bay undefeated at 7–0. Derrick Brooks intercepted Randal Cunningham, setting up Warrick Dunn\\'s first touchdown run. A back and forth game saw the score tied 17–17 at halftime. Minnesota took a 24–17 lead in the third quarter, but Tampa Bay came back in the fourth. A field goal followed by a Mike Alstott touchdown run with just under six minutes remaining gave the Bucs a 27–24 lead. The Buccaneers had two rushers over 100 yards: Alstott (128) and Dunn (115), with Alstott sealing the game late with a rush of 38 yards.\\n\\nTampa Bay defeated Minnesota 27–24, the Vikings’ first loss and only one during the regular season. The Bucs remained at 0.500, improving to 4–4, and were now 4–0 at Raymond James Stadium.\\n\\nSection::::Week 10: Tennessee Oilers.\\nTampa Bay held a 16-3 halftime lead, but trailing 24–22 at the two-minute warning, Tennessee was facing 3rd down & 8 at their own 29-yard line. A defensive stop by Tampa Bay would have given them the ball back, and an opportunity to drive for a game-winning field goal. However, quarterback Steve McNair broke out for a game-icing 71-yard touchdown run, and the Tennessee Oilers won 31–22.\\n\\nSection::::Week 11: at Jacksonville Jaguars.\\nTampa Bay was leading 24–23 with three minutes remaining. Fred Taylor broke out for a 70-yard touchdown run with 2:40 left, and Jacksonville won 29–24.\\n\\nSection::::Week 12: Detroit Lions.\\nTampa Bay trailed 21–7, but rallied late. With just over two minutes remaining, Trent Dilfer drove the Buccaneers to the Detroit 11-yard line. He was intercepted in the endzone, and Detroit held on to win 28–25. It was Tampa Bay\\'s third straight loss.\\n\\nSection::::Week 13: at Chicago Bears.\\nTampa Bay got back to their winning ways, winning their first road game of the season at Chicago. Late in the second quarter, the Buccaneers blocked a Bears punt, and Ronde Barber scooped it up. He returned the ball 21 yards for a touchdown. As time expired in the first half, Trent Dilfer threw up a Hail Mary touchdown, which was caught by Brice Hunter, his first career NFL touchdown. The Bucs took a 21–14 lead into halftime, and won the game 31–17.\\n\\nTampa Bay\\'s record was now 5–7, still alive for the wild card hunt.\\n\\nSection::::Week 14: Green Bay Packers.\\nTampa Bay hosted Green Bay in their first Monday Night Football home game since 1982. The Buccaneers forced 8 fumbles, and sacked Brett Favre 8 times. Late in the first quarter, Trent Dilfer connected to Jacquez Green for a 64-yard touchdown pass. Minutes later, at the beginning of the second quarter, Dilfer passed to Bert Emanuel in a nearly identical 62-yard touchdown pass. Leading 17–15 in the fourth quarter, Dilfer scrambled through the middle of the Packers defensive line to score a 6-yard touchdown, and a 24–15 lead. Green bay would trim the deficit to 24–22, but the Buccaneers held on to win.\\n\\nTampa Bay improved to 6–7 on the season.\\n\\nSection::::Week 15: Pittsburgh Steelers.\\nTampa Bay won their third game in a row, shutting down the Steelers to just 168 yard of offense. The Tampa Bay defense intercepted Kordell Stewart three times, and Mike Tomczak once. Mike Alstott ran for 78 yards on a wet and rainy day. The Steelers only points came early in the fourth quarter.\\n\\nTampa Bay won 16–3 and evened their record at 7–7. They were now back in the hunt for the wild card.\\n\\nSection::::Week 16: at Washington Redskins.\\nTampa Bay\\'s playoff chances were dealt a big blow in the Week 16 loss at Washington. Tampa Bay led the Redskins 16–7 early in the fourth quarter, but blew the lead at the end. Leading 16–13 with six minutes to go, Jacquez Green fumbled a kickoff, turning the ball over. On the next play, Stephen Alexander caught the game-winning touchdown for Washington. Tampa Bay had two last chances to come back, but both times, Trent Dilfer threw interceptions.\\n\\nThe Buccaneers fell to 7–8 on the season, and would need to win in week 17 to keep their playoff hopes alive.\\n\\nSection::::Week 17: at Cincinnati Bengals.\\nTampa Bay clobbered Cincinnati 35–0, a franchise best for a road shutout. Mike Alstott scored three rushing touchdowns, and the Bucs defense intercepted the Bengals twice (including a 56-yard return by Ronde Barber)\\n\\nTampa Bay finished 8–8 on the season, winning four out of their last five games, and the end of the game, were still alive for an NFC wild card spot. Tampa Bay needed the Giants to beat the Eagles and the Chargers to beat the Cardinals . The Giants won, helping Tampa Bay, but the Cardinals beat the Chargers 16–13 with a 52-yard field goal as time expired. By the time the Buccaneers\\' plane had landed back in Tampa, they were ousted from the playoffs.\\n', 'title': '1998 Tampa Bay Buccaneers season', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11389733'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'CxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1139093', 'text': '1987 Formula One World Championship\\n\\nThe 1987 FIA Formula One World Championship was the 41st season of FIA Formula One motor racing. It featured the 1987 Formula One World Championship for Drivers and the 1987 Formula One World Championship for Constructors, which were contested concurrently over a sixteen-race series that commenced on 12 April and ended on 15 November. The World Championship for Drivers was won by Nelson Piquet, and the World Championship for Constructors by Williams-Honda. The season also encompassed the Jim Clark Trophy and the Colin Chapman Trophy, which were respectively contested by drivers and constructors of Formula One cars powered by naturally aspirated engines.\\n\\nSection::::Season summary.\\nAt first, the 1987 championship was a four-way battle between Williams drivers Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell, Lotus driver Ayrton Senna, and McLaren driver and defending two-time champion Alain Prost. Eventually, it became a straight fight between Piquet and Mansell, who between them finished with nine wins from the season\\'s sixteen races. Mansell took six wins to Piquet\\'s three; however, he only recorded three other points finishes while Piquet recorded nine (including seven second places). The duel was settled in Piquet\\'s favour at the penultimate race of the season in Japan, when Mansell crashed heavily in practice and injured his back, ending his season and handing Piquet his third Drivers\\' Championship.\\n\\nSenna finished third having won at Monaco and Detroit; the latter was the 79th and final win for the original Team Lotus. Prost finished fourth despite winning three races; his victory in Portugal took him past Jackie Stewart\\'s record of 27 Grand Prix victories. Ferrari\\'s Gerhard Berger won the final two races of the season, in Japan and Australia, to finish fifth.\\n\\nThe Constructors\\' Championship was comfortably won by Williams, with McLaren second, Lotus third and Ferrari fourth.\\n\\nFor 1987 only, there were two other championships, contested by drivers and constructors of cars powered by naturally aspirated engines: the Jim Clark Trophy for drivers, and the Colin Chapman Trophy for constructors. These championships encouraged teams to switch to such engines, ahead of the ban on turbos from onwards. Tyrrell were the only team to run two \"atmo\" cars for the entire season and thus easily won the Colin Chapman Trophy, while their drivers Jonathan Palmer and Philippe Streiff came first and second respectively in the Jim Clark Trophy.\\n\\nWith the return of the naturally aspirated engines, and the aforementioned turbo ban in mind, the FIA introduced new rules for 1987 in an effort to reduce costs and slow down the cars with a resultant increase in safety, as well as to increase competitiveness between the two engine types. Turbo-powered cars now had to feature a pop-off valve which restricted boost to 4.0 bar, thus limiting engine power. However, advances in engine development, aerodynamics, tyres and suspension meant that the leading teams such as Williams, McLaren and Ferrari nonetheless frequently recorded faster times than they had in 1986, when turbo boost was unrestricted. The FIA also banned super-soft (and sticky) qualifying tyres for 1987, thus eliminating the unpopular practice of having to find a clear lap on tyres which were good for two flying laps at best.\\n\\nPirelli\\'s withdrawal from F1 at the end of 1986 meant that Goodyear was the sole tyre supplier for 1987.\\n\\nSection::::Drivers and constructors.\\nThe following drivers and constructors competed in the 1987 season.\\nSection::::Race by race.\\nSection::::Pre-season report.\\nThe dramatic end to the 1986 season in Australia, with Alain Prost winning the World Championship at the last gasp created tension between Nigel Mansell and Nelson Piquet but the combination was still potent and with the British Mansell and the Brazilian Piquet staying with the team it was still a powerful challenger. McLaren was without John Barnard but had gained the services of Gordon Murray and Neil Oatley and had retained Alain Prost while Keke Rosberg\\'s retirement had opened the way for Swede Stefan Johansson to join the team, having been dropped by Ferrari in favor of Gerhard Berger. Benetton had hired Thierry Boutsen to replace Berger as Teo Fabi\\'s partner and with the Haas Lola team having closed down the team took over the factory Ford turbo engines, which had improved considerably over their rushed development time. Team Lotus changed color with JPS being replaced by Camel and landed a Honda engine deal for drivers Ayrton Senna and Satoru Nakajima. Martin Brundle left Tyrrell to join Christian Danner at Zakspeed while Zakspeed\\'s Jonathan Palmer joined Philippe Streiff at Tyrrell, which had gone back to using Cosworth DFZ engines. The only BMW engines left were the factory supply to Brabham, these being the units which the cylinders angled to create a low profile for the BT55. Derek Warwick left Brabham to join F1 returnee Eddie Cheever at Arrows with rebadged upright BMW engines which were now known as Megatrons. The team also got a new technical director Ross Brawn joining from the Haas Lola team. Riccardo Patrese was joined at Brabham by Andrea de Cesaris while his place alongside Sandro Nannini at Minardi was taken by wealthy Spanish newcomer Adrian Campos. Osella had only one Alfa Romeo-engined car in Brazil for Alex Caffi. Ligier was due to run new Alfa Romeo four-cylinder turbo engines for Rene Arnoux and Piercarlo Ghinzani but things went badly wrong: Arnoux made disparaging remarks about the Italian company\\'s new four-cylinder turbo engine, referring to them as \"used food\". Alfa Romeo had only recently been acquired by FIAT which was not keen on the Alfa name being in F1. As a result, Alfa Romeo cited a clause in the Ligier contract stating that Ligier should not do anything to damage the image of Alfa Romeo and quit the team. The news was disastrous for Ligier and the team had to miss Brazil while modifying its cars to run Megatron engines. With the rules restricting turbo engines more and more and fewer turbo engines available several teams went back to Cosworth power and the FIA decided to introduce a separate competition for the normally-aspirated cars, introducing a Jim Clark Trophy for drivers and a Colin Chapman Trophy for teams. Four teams would be eligible: Tyrrell, AGS, March and the new Larrousse Lola team, which did not appear in Brazil. March had backing from Leyton House and Ivan Capelli driving an uprated Formula 3000 car while AGS had hired Pascal Fabre to drive. The overall entry was down to 23 cars and with Pirelli having withdrawn there was only one tire supplier, Goodyear.\\n\\nSection::::Race 1: Brazil.\\nThe first race in April at the fast, rough and abrasive Jacarepagua Riocentro Autodrome in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil resulted in a dominant showing from Williams-Honda with Mansell ahead of Piquet. Then came Senna, Fabi, Prost, Boutsen, Berger, Warwick, Alboreto and Johansson.\\n\\nThe March team suffered a setback on race morning when it ran out of engines, and so the field was down to 22. At the start, Piquet took the lead from the fast-starting Senna while Mansell made a bad start and had to fight his way back to third. on lap seven Piquet suddenly went into the pits, his car having picked up paper in its radiators. he rejoined back in 11th position, leaving Senna to lead Mansell although the British driver was soon in the pits as well to have his radiators cleared. He rejoined behind Piquet and the pair then began to climb through the field. Senna pitted because of handling trouble and so Prost went into the lead and when he stopped for new tyres Boutsen briefly led before Piquet went back into the lead before his second stop. Prost then went ahead again and led for the rest of the afternoon, never looking threatened as he did not have a third tire stop while his rivals Senna and Prost did. Mansell\\'s race was disrupted by a puncture while Senna went out with engine failure and so Prost came home to win ahead of Piquet, Johansson, Berger, Boutsen and Mansell.\\n\\nSection::::Race 2: San Marino (Imola, Italy).\\nAfter the season-opening race in Brazil there was a three-week gap during which March finished building the first 871 chassis for Capelli. Osella expanded to two cars with the second being run by a youngster called Gabriele Tarquini, while Brundle had the first of Zakspeed\\'s new 871 chassis. Ligier was back in action with Megatron-engined cars for Rene Arnoux and Piercarlo Ghinzani. In addition there was another new team in the form of Gerard Larrousse\\'s Lola-Ford/Cosworth team which had employed Philippe Alliot.\\n\\nBut come the San Marino Grand Prix held at the fast Autodromo Dino Ferrari in Italy, Nelson Piquet had a huge accident at the flat out Tamburello corner when he suffered a tire failure during qualifying and was forbidden from racing by F1 doctor Sid Watkins. Goodyear decided that in the interests of safety it would fly in new tyres overnight for Saturday qualifying. On Saturday afternoon Ayrton Senna took pole position in his Lotus-Honda with Nigel Mansell second quickest in his Williams-Honda. The second row featured Teo Fabi (Benetton-Ford) and Alain Prost (McLaren-TAG) with the Ferraris of Michele Alboreto and Gerhard Berger together on the third row. The top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson (McLaren), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) and the two Arrows-Megatrons of Derek Warwick and Eddie Cheever. Senna led from the start but on the second lap at Tosa, Mansell swept into the lead and began to pull away. On Lap 6 Prost found a way ahead of Senna and then clawed his way up behind Mansell and stayed there. Prost\\'s race ended, however, on Lap 15 when the McLaren suffered an alternator failure. By then Alboreto had got ahead of Senna and so was in second place with Senna third and Patrese fourth. Mansell stopped earlier than planned for new tyres but was still ahead when everyone reemerged from their first stops. Patrese had moved to second with Alboreto and Senna chasing. In the closing laps Patrese dropped back because he had used too much fuel and so Alboreto was second until he lost boost pressure and Senna went ahead again. Mansell took the flag just under half a minute ahead of Senna with Alboreto third. Johansson was fourth, Martin Brundle fifth (scoring Zakspeed\\'s first points) and Satoru Nakajima picking up sixth in his Lotus-Honda.\\n\\nSection::::Race 3: Belgium.\\nThe high-speed circuit tour kept coming, and next was the Belgian Grand Prix at the magnificent and fast Spa-Francorchamps public road circuit near Liege. The field was much as it had been at the San Marino GP a fortnight earlier, although Osella was back to one car again. Nelson Piquet was back in action after his huge crash at Imola while Zakspeed had two 871 chassis for Martin Brundle and Christian Danner, the German having used an older car in the two previous races. Qualifying saw the two Williams-Hondas at the front with Mansell on pole by nearly 1.5 seconds while Ayrton Senna was third in his Lotus-Honda ahead of the two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Thierry Boutsen\\'s Benetton-Ford/Cosworth, Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham-BMW, Teo Fabi\\'s Benetton and Stefan Johansson in the second McLaren. At the start Mansell took the lead and led Senna, Piquet, Alboreto and Prost. At the start of the second lap Philippe Streiff lost control of his Tyrrell at Raidillon and smashed into the barriers, the impact tearing the engine from the car. Jonathan Palmer then arrived on the scene in the second Tyrrell and smashed into the wreck of Streiff\\'s car. The race was stopped but both men were unhurt, although the Tyrrell team\\'s cars were demolished. At race was restarted which was good luck for Berger and home favorite Boutsen who had collided at the Bus Stop chicane. This time Senna took the lead from Mansell although halfway around the first lap Nigel tried to overtake and the two cars collided and both spun. Senna was out but Mansell was able to get going again. This put Piquet into the lead and Mansell at the back. He would continue until damage from the incident caused him to stop on lap 17, and after he retired, he marched to the Lotus pits to confront Senna, resulting Mansell grabbing Senna by the throat and then the two drivers got into a fist fight. Both had to be separated Second place belonged to Alboreto with Prost third, Boutsen fourth and Fabi fifth after Berger went out with an engine failure. Piquet went out with an engine failure after 10 laps and with Alboreto stopping with a broken CV joint, Prost went into the lead with Boutsen second and Johansson third, the Swede having overtaken Fabi. Stefan then closed on Boutsen and moved to second on lap 17. The pits stops changed little but in the latter part of the race Boutsen fell behind a charged-up Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham-BMW). Boutsen finally retired with a broken CV joint which left fourth place to Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron) with Satoru Nakajima\\'s Lotus-Honda and Rene Arnoux sixth in the Ligier-Megatron.\\n\\nSection::::Race 4: Monaco.\\nThere we no changes in the entry after the Belgian GP and so it was business as usual at Monaco where the three leading Honda-engined cars were at the front as usual with Nigel Mansell taking pole in his Williams, Ayrton Senna second in the Lotus and Nelson Piquet third in the second Williams. Alain Prost was fourth for the McLaren-TAG team with Michele Alboreto fifth in his Ferrari. Sixth place was a surprise in the form of Eddie Cheever\\'s Arrows-Megatron while the top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson (McLaren-TAG), Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford) and Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW). Alboreto had a spectacular crash when he ran into the back of Christian Danner\\'s Zakspeed on the climb after Ste Devote. The Ferrari flew through the air but fortunately landed back on the track. With 26 cars starting at Monaco for the first time there were worries about safety in the race. At the start Mansell went straight into the lead so there was no chance of a repetition of his collision with Senna at Spa. The Brazilian was second with Piquet third ahead of Alboreto, Prost and Cheever. The order at the front remained unchanged until Lap 30 when Mansell slowed with a loss of boost pressure. Senna went into the lead and stayed there all the way to the flag, despite stopping for tyres. Piquet stayed second while Prost moved to third, overhauling Cheever who ran third for much of the mid-race. In the closing laps Prost suffered an engine failure and so third place went to Alboreto with Berger fourth (after Cheever went out with engine failure), Jonathan Palmer fifth in his Tyrrell and Ivan Capelli sixth in the Leyton House March.\\n\\nSection::::Race 5: Detroit (USA).\\nThe Canadian Grand Prix had been cancelled due to a dispute over local sponsors Molson and Labatt\\'s; so Detroit was the only North American round in the middle of the European season. This race, on the slowest circuit of the season was generally considered to the toughest and most demanding race of the season, due to the tight and extremely bumpy downtown Detroit city streets lined with concrete walls. The entry was unchanged from the field that had raced at Monaco three weeks earlier and as usual the battle for pole position was between the Honda-powered cars with Nigel Mansell fastest on this occasion with his Williams. Just behind him was Ayrton Senna\\'s Lotus and Nelson Piquet\\'s Williams. There was then a big gap back to Thierry Boutsen\\'s Benetton-Ford, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG, Eddie Cheever\\'s Arrows-Megatron and Michele Alboreto\\'s Ferrari. The top 10 was completed by Teo Fabi (Benetton), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW) and Derek Warwick in the second Arrows. Mansell took the lead at the start and began to pull away from Senna while behind in the midfield Stefan Johansson (McLaren) damaged a front wing on the back of Warwick\\'s Arrows and Satoru Nakajima (Lotus-Honda) crashed into the back of Ivan Capelli\\'s Leyton House March and then managed to collide with Adrian Campos\\'s Minardi at the next corner. Behind the two front-runners Piquet had trouble keeping Cheever behind him and eventually gave himself a puncture when he tapped a wheel and had to pit for new tyres. Cheever then had to fight to hold off Fabi and on lap seven the Benetton driver tried to pass and made a mess of it and ended up removing the nose of his car. Both drivers pitted, Fabi to retire and Cheever for new tyres. He rejoined at the back. This left Alboreto third ahead of Boutsen and Prost and the only change in the next few laps was as Prost moved up ahead of the Benetton. Alboreto went out with gearbox failure and so Prost was third as the pit stops approached. During the stops Mansell had a wheel nut stick on his car and lost 10 seconds and that meant that Senna went into the lead with Mansell second, Prost third and Piquet, who had charged up through the field in fourth. Nelson continued his charge and overtook Prost and closed on Mansell, who was suffering from leg cramps. He eventually fell behind the Brazilian, Prost and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari). Senna won at his ease with Piquet second and Prost third. The remaining points went to Berger, Mansell and the recovering Cheever.\\n\\nSection::::Race 6: France.\\nAt the French Grand Prix held at the Paul Ricard circuit near the French Riviera city of Le Castellet, the battle of the Honda powered cars was interrupted in France by a good performance from Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG which qualified second to Nigel Mansell\\'s Williams. The second row featured Ayrton Senna\\'s Lotus-Honda and Nelson Piquet in the second Williams while fifth place went to Thierry Boutsen (Benetton) with Gerhard Berger (Ferrari), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) following the first four rows. The top 10 was completed by Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren and Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron. Mansell made a good start to lead Prost into the first corner but on the back straight Piquet blasted ahead of the McLaren to make it a Williams 1–2 with Prost third and Senna fourth ahead of the two Benettons, Boutsen ahead of Fabi. This order did not change although Mansell ran into trouble when he ran over debris from Johansson who had had an accident with Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham) at the first corner. On lap 19 Piquet had a moment and lost second place to Prost but during the pits stops the Brazilian managed to get ahead of both Prost and Mansell. Mansell quickly retook second from Prost and closed up on Piquet but overtaking was another issue until Piquet made a mistake and ran wide on lap 46 and Mansell went ahead. At the second round of stops Piquet stalled in the pitlane and lost just under 10 secs and so Mansell was able to win. Nelson finished second while Prost and Senna were third and fourth ahead of Fabi with the final point going to Philippe Streiff in the Tyrrell-Ford/Cosworth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 7: Britain.\\nThe Mansell-Piquet inter team battle continued at the British Grand Prix at Silverstone with victory in qualifying going to Nelson Piquet who beat his Williams teammate Nigel Mansell to pole by less than a tenth of a second. Third was Ayrton Senna in his Lotus while Alain Prost was fourth fastest in his McLaren-TAG. The third row of the grid was shared by the two Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi while row four was an all-Ferrari affair with Michele Alboreto just ahead of Gerhard Berger. The top 10 was completed by Andrea de Cesaris\\'s Brabham-BMW and the second McLaren driven by Stefan Johansson. There was disappointment for Ligier with Piercarlo Ghinzani being excluded from the meeting after he ran out of fuel on the circuit and was then refueled and push-started by his mechanics. The Italian also did a couple of extra laps at the end of the first qualifying and the catalogue of rule-breaking proved to be too much for the stewards to accept. The Silverstone circuit, which was originally the fastest circuit on the calendar had been modified: the Woodcote chicane had been taken out and replaced with a slower chicane further down the Bridge straight. In what was to be a classic race Prost made a better start than both Williams drivers and took the lead but at the second corner Piquet blasted ahead of the Frenchman and almost immediately Mansell followed Piquet through. It was going to be a straight fight between the two of them. The pace of the Williams drivers and the superiority of the Williams FW11B on high-speed tracks meant that Mansell and Piquet lapped the entire field near the end of the race. Piquet had led for most of the afternoon but in the closing laps, with the crowd roaring him on and having a fresher set of tires (Piquet had decided to go the entire distance on one set), Mansell closed up on Piquet and at Stowe Corner on lap 63 of 65 Mansell went ahead of his rival with a stunning passing maneuver. The pace of the two Williams cars was so furious that they lapped the entire field on a dry circuit. On the slowing down lap Mansell ran out of fuel, and the Honda engine in his car blew up. Third place went to Senna with fourth going to Satoru Nakajima in the second Lotus-Honda and the remaining points going to Derek Warwick (Arrows-Megatron/BMW) and Fabi.\\n\\nSection::::Race 8: Germany.\\nGoing into the German Grand Prix at the very fast Hockenheimring with its forested straights, the World Championship was finely balanced at the midseason with Nelson Piquet leading on 39 points, Ayrton Senna second with 35, Nigel Mansell third with 30 and Alain Prost fourth with 26. Qualifying resulted in Mansell beating Senna to pole with Prost third, edging Piquet to fourth. Michele Alboreto was fifth fastest in his Ferrari with Thierry Boutsen sixth for Benetton. The top 10 was completed by Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham-BMW), Stefan Johansson (McLaren), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Gerhard Berger (Ferrari). At the start Senna took the lead with Mansell slow away but he recovered to be second by the end of the first lap ahead of Prost, Piquet, Boutsen, Alboreto and Johansson. At the start of the second lap Mansell went ahead and it was clear that Senna was holding everyone up behind him. Prost went by later on the second lap and Piquet followed on the third lap. Prost was able to close up to Mansell and on lap seven the Frenchman went ahead. Further back in the field the attrition rate was high but at the front little changed until lap 19 when Prost pitted for tires. When Mansell pitted on lap 23 Prost went ahead again. Mansell hoped to catch the McLaren but his engine failed on lap 25 and so Piquet moved to second place while Senna pitted twice trying to solve a serious handling problem and dropped back, leaving Johansson in third place after Boutsen\\'s Benetton had blown its engine. Prost seemed to have the race won but with four laps to go an alternator belt broke and he was forced to retire. Victory thus went to Piquet with Johansson second, Senna third and stragglers picking up the other points: Philippe Streiff and Jonathan Palmer coming home fourth and fifth in their Tyrrells and Philippe Alliot sixth in his Larrousse Lola. The only other man running was Martin Brundle in his Zakspeed 10 laps behind the winner. The attrition rate was in fact so high in this race that only 6 of 26 starting cars finished – the lowest number since the 1984 Detroit Grand Prix. Most of the failures in this race were engine- or turbo-related; the 1.5L turbo-charged cars were producing around 950\\xa0hp in race trim.\\n\\nSection::::Race 9: Hungary.\\nThe big news at the Hungarian Grand Prix at the Hungaroring near Budapest was that Ayrton Senna had informed Lotus that he would not be staying with the team in 1988. Team boss Peter Warr moved quickly and signed Nelson Piquet, who was unhappy that Frank Williams would not give him clear number one status at Williams. Senna was going to join Alain Prost at McLaren. Qualifying for the race in Budapest saw Ferrari making a step forward as Gerhard Berger qualified second behind Nigel Mansell\\'s Williams-Honda. Nelson Piquet was third with Alain Prost fourth in his McLaren while Michele Alboreto was fifth in the second Ferrari and Senna sixth. The top ten was completed by Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren, Derek Warwick in the Arrows-Megatron/BMW and Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham-BMW. Mansell took the lead at the start with Berger making a slightly hesitant start which allowed Piquet to take second before Berger retook the place with a brave outside overtaking maneuver at the first corner. Piquet then lost third place to Alboreto and so it was Mansell being chased by the two Ferraris, with Piquet fourth ahead of Senna, Prost, Boutsen and Johansson. Berger\\'s race would be short-lived as he retired after 13 laps with differential failure. This moved Alboreto to second and Piquet to third and the order stayed the same until Piquet overtook Alboreto on lap 29. Senna was fourth with Boutsen fifth and Prost sixth. The order remained unchanged until lap 44 when Alboreto disappeared with an engine problem and then in the closing laps Prost moved ahead of Boutsen. On lap 71 of 76 Mansell\\'s car lost its right rear wheel nut and he was forced to retire, and victory went to Piquet- this was a major blow to Mansell\\'s championship hopes. Senna was second with Prost third ahead of Boutsen, Patrese and Warwick.\\n\\nSection::::Race 10: Austria.\\nNelson Piquet\\'s fortunate win in Hungary gave him a seven-point lead in the World Championship over Ayrton Senna with Nigel Mansell and Alain Prost 11 points behind Senna. At the Austrian Grand Prix, held at the scenic and spectacular Österreichring, the fastest Grand Prix circuit of the year Nigel Mansell was handicapped slightly by the fact that he had had a wisdom tooth removed before practice began and this affected his performance in qualifying, allowing his Williams-Honda teammate Nelson Piquet to take pole position at an incredible average speed of 159\\xa0mph (255\\xa0km/h). Mansell was second with Gerhard Berger third in his Ferrari and Thierry Boutsen fourth in his Benetton-Ford, just ahead of his teammate Teo Fabi. Michele Alboreto was sixth in the second Ferrari ahead of Ayrton Senna\\'s Lotus-Honda, Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham-BMW, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren and Andrea de Cesaris in the second Brabham. Stefan Johansson had a big fright in practice when he found a deer in the middle of the road and hit it at high speed. This destroyed the McLaren\\'s suspension and he crashed heavily, cracking a rib in the ensuing accident.\\n\\nThe safety of the Austrian track was becoming more of an issue and on race day the problems were underlined again. The narrow pit straight – which had caused problems at Grands Prix for years and one that the organizers had failed to widen – became the center topic of the debate of safety. At the start Piquet got away ahead of a fast-starting Fabi but the race was stopped when Martin Brundle\\'s Zakspeed went out of control, hit a barrier and bounced back into the middle for the track. Rene Arnoux (Ligier) and Adrian Campos (Minardi) collided while the two Tyrrells hit one another and Piercarlo Ghinzani\\'s Ligier was also out with a broken suspension.\\n\\nThe grid was reformed and the field tried to get away again. Piquet went into the lead but Mansell had a problem and was crawling away slowly. Berger too slowed suddenly as he tried to pass the Williams and so there was serious congestion behind with the result that Patrese hit Eddie Cheever (Arrows-Megatron). Johansson hit the back of Cheever and Brundle hit the rear of the McLaren. This resulted in Ghinzani braking and being hit by Alex Caffi\\'s Osella and Ivan Capelli (March), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola), Christian Danner (Zakspeed) and Philippe Streiff (Tyrrell) all becoming involved and then Pascal Fabre (AGS) driving over the back of Jonathan Palmer\\'s Tyrrell. The track was blocked again and the race red flagged for a second time.\\n\\nRemarkably most of the field was able to take the third start with only Streiff missing, although Brundle, Caffi, Danner and Fabre all started from the pitlane. Prost\\'s McLaren refused to get away and so he jumped into the spare and joined the queue in the pitlane. At the end of the parade lap Alboreto went into the pits to have his steering wheel fixed and so there were sixth cars starting from pitlane. This time Senna stalled but everyone avoided the Lotus and Piquet took the lead from Boutsen, Berger, Mansell and Fabi. At the tail of the field Senna, Prost and Alboreto were beginning to charge through the backmarkers. Berger disappeared with a turbo failure after only a few laps and Boutsen disappeared on lap 15 with a gear-linkage which had come loose. This left Piquet and Mansell at the front with Fabi third. On lap 21 Mansell took the lead as the two Williams drivers were diving through backmarkers going down the straight leading to the Bosch-Kurve. Once ahead Mansell was able to keep his lead at the pit stops and Fabi remained third so attention turned to the battles further down the field as Alboreto and Senna battling it out. The two collided and Senna had to pit for a new front wing. He dropped out of the points but managed to pick up places when Alboreto retired with an exhaust problem and Prost was slowed with a similar failure. This meant that Boutsen was fourth with Senna fifth and Prost sixth.\\n\\nThis would be the last Austrian Grand Prix for 10 years; the race would return to the same shortened venue in 1997.\\n\\nSection::::Race 11: Italy.\\nThe field was expanded at the Monza Autodrome near Milan by the arrival of the new Coloni team, fielding Nicola Larini. The Osella team expanded to two cars with the Swiss Franco Forini joining Alex Caffi. Honda had announced that it would not be supplying Williams with engines in 1988, despite the fact the Japanese company still had one year to go on its contract. Honda had decided that it wanted to be with McLaren. This led to questions over whether Honda would treat the two Williams drivers fairly in the battle for the World Championship as Nelson Piquet would be a Honda driver in 1988 and Mansell would not. The Honda men said that it made no difference but few believed them. The Williams team had its new active-suspension system ready and Nelson Piquet used it, while Nigel Mansell stayed with a conventional car. Piquet took pole position with Mansell a tenth behind him but Ayrton Senna was beaten the third place by Gerhard Berger\\'s Ferrari. Then came Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG, Michele Alboreto\\'s Ferrari and Teo Fabi\\'s Benetton. The top 10 was completed by the two Brabhams of Andrea de Cesaris and Riccardo Patrese. At the start of the race Mansell made a good start but then missed a gearchange and so Piquet went into the lead at the first corner with Berger third ahead of Boutsen, Prost and Senna. At the start of the second lap Berger challenged for second place and Mansell closed the door so the two cars collided and Boutsen moved to second place with Berger third and Mansell fourth. The order then remained the same until Mansell was finally able to pass Berger on lap 17. he then overtook Boutsen as well. The mid-race pit stops put Senna into the lead and it looked as though he might be able to go without a pit stop as he had done in Monaco and Detroit. The two Williams-Hondas were second and third with Boutsen behind them. Senna looked fine until lap 43 when he was lapping Piercarlo Ghinzani\\'s Ligier and went off across a sand trap at the Parabolica. By the time he was back on the track Piquet was in the lead. Senna tried to regain the place but his tires would not allow him to challenge and so they finished with Piquet winning the race. Mansell was third with Berger fourth, Boutsen fifth and Stefan Johansson (McLaren) sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 12: Portugal.\\nAt the Estoril Autodrome near the Portuguese capital of Lisbon, the Coloni team did not reappear in Portugal but Osella continued to run a second car for Franco Forini. Ferrari\\'s progress throughout the summer months was confirmed with Gerhard Berger taking pole position ahead of Nigel Mansell\\'s Williams-Honda, Alain Prost\\'s McLaren and Nelson Piquet\\'s Williams. Ayrton Senna was fifth in his Lotus-Honda and the top 10 was completed by Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari, Riccardo Patrese\\'s Brabham, Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren and the two Benetton-Fords of Thierry Boutsen and Teo Fabi. At the start Mansell took the lead from Berger but behind them Alboreto collided with Piquet. Derek Warwick spun his Arrows to avoid them and then Satoru Nakajima (Lotus) collided with Martin Brundle (Zakspeed) and the rest of the field piled into the wrecks. The result was that Adrian Campos (Minardi), Christian Danner (Zakspeed), Rene Arnoux (Ligier), Philippe Alliot (Larrousse Lola) and Eddie Cheever (Arrows) were also involved. The race was stopped, and at the restart everyone was able to start apart from Danner and Mansell went into the lead again. At the end of the first lap, however, Berger took the lead and with Senna fighting off Piquet for third place the race began to settle down. It took Piquet until the eleventh lap to overtake Senna. Mansell pressured Berger early on but then dropped away as his engine began to misfire and on lap 14 stopped on the circuit. Senna slowed and went into the pits with an electronic problem while Alboreto closed up on Piquet and began to make life difficult for the Brazilian. He eventually got ahead but Piquet soon retaliated. The mid-race pitstops elevated Prost to second place ahead of Piquet and Fabi, while Alboreto disappeared with a transmission failure. The order remained unchanged until the closing laps as Prost gradually closed on Berger and put the Austrian under pressure. On lap 68 of 70 Berger crumbled under the pressure and spun. Prost was in the lead and duly won his 28th victory, to beat Jackie Stewart\\'s long-established record of 27 Grand Prix victories, a record he held until Michael Schumacher surpassed with 52 victories at the 2001 Belgian Grand Prix. A disappointed Berger was second with Piquet third, Fabi fourth, Johansson fifth and Cheever sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 13: Spain.\\nThe Spanish Grand Prix had been moved to being the final Grand Prix in Europe of the year, and at the Jerez circuit near Seville in southern Spain, the Coloni team was back in action and with Franco Forini staying on for a third event with the Osella team the field was up to 28 cars. The battle for pole position was between the two Williams-Honda with World Championship leader Nelson Piquet (in an active Williams) on pole ahead of challenger Nigel Mansell (who chose to use the passive car). The two Ferraris of Gerhard Berger and Michele Alboreto were third and fourth with Ayrton Senna fifth in his Lotus-Honda. Teo Fabi was sixth in his Benetton-Ford with Alain Prost (McLaren), Thierry Boutsen (Benetton) and the two Brabhams of Riccardo Patrese and Andrea de Cesaris rounding off the top 10. In the race Piquet took the lead but Mansell dived ahead at the end of the first lap and began to pull away from the Brazilian. Senna was third with the two Ferraris and Boutsen chasing. The top five did not change for the first half of the race with Senna at the front of a train of cars. At the pitstops Mansell was away and gone before Senna arrived but Piquet was slower and found himself stuck in fourth place behind Senna and Prost. He challenged Prost but got it wrong and spun back to sixth place. Senna had decided to go through without a stop and those behind him were left to battle with one another while Mansell drove on to victory. Senna\\'s gamble did not pay off because his tires deteriorated quickly and eventually Piquet, Boutsen and Prost were all able to get ahead. Senna then dropped back behind Johansson as well. Piquet then made a mistake and ran wide but Boutsen also made a mistake and spun and so Prost was second with Johansson third, Piquet fourth, Senna fifth and Philippe Alliot sixth in his Larrousse Lola.\\n\\nSection::::Race 14: Mexico.\\nThe Formula One circus moved from one Hispanophonic country to another; this time to Mexico 3 weeks after the Spanish round. This race, held at the high-altitude and very bumpy Hermanos Rodriguez Autodrome located within a recreational public park in the middle of Mexico City was the 450th Formula One Grand Prix, and the field was much as it had been all season, the only changes being that Osella had gone back to one car and Larrousse has expanded to two with Yannick Dalmas joining Philippe Alliot. Nelson Piquet was 18 points ahead with three races to go and so Nigel Mansell needed a good result without Piquet scoring too well. The atmosphere in the Williams had deteriorated badly between the two drivers to the point where team boss Frank Williams had admitted that he could not do anything to make things better but as Ayrton Senna was out of the running for the World Championship there was no chance that the two could take points from one another as they had in 1986 and let a third driver win the title. In qualifying the drivers found that thanks to the geologically active land the Mexico City track, already made challenging by the humid heat, dust and smog had become more bumpy than last year and there were a series of big accidents, including one of Mansell, and another for Ayrton Senna. The drivers were all complaining intensely about the track surface to FIA personnel, but not much could be done at this point. Mansell was on pole from Gerhard Berger second in his Ferrari ahead of Piquet, Thierry Boutsen (Benetton-Ford), Alain Prost (McLaren), Teo Fabi (Benetton) and Senna. The top 10 was rounded off by Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Michele Alboreto (Ferrari) and Andrea de Cesaris (Brabham). This Grand Prix was a very unusual race, and at the start Mansell made a bad start and was overtaken by Berger, Boutsen, Piquet and Prost. At the first corner Piquet and Prost tangled and both cars spun. Prost was out but Piquet got going again with assistance from the track marshals. Mansell had moved up to third, and there were further incidents down through the field with Stefan Johansson being spinning and being eliminated when he was hit by Christian Danner, and Nakajima crashing into the back of Derek Warwick\\'s Arrows at the end of the main straight. At the front Boutsen took the lead from Berger on the second lap with Mansell a distant third but then the Benetton began to misfire and Berger went back into the lead and Boutsen went out with electronic injection trouble. Berger retired six laps later with engine failure and with Alboreto also having disappeared Ferrari\\'s race was over. Mansell was thus left in the lead with Senna second and Patrese third and Piquet fourth. Then there were red flags after Warwick (Arrows-Megatron) had a huge accident at the final corner when something broke at the back of his car as a result of Nakajima running into him earlier. A new grid was formed up based on the order of the cars before the crash with the race being decided on aggregate. Piquet took the lead at the restart but with Mansell sitting behind him there was no way he could win the race. In the closing laps Senna spun off and so Piquet ended up in second place having done enough to beat Patrese on aggregate. Eddie Cheever was fourth in his Arrows with Fabi fifth and Philippe Alliot sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 15: Japan.\\nFormula 1 returned to Japan for the first time in 10 years and the circus came for the first time to the twisty, very demanding Honda-owned Suzuka track near Nagoya having been at the very fast Fuji Speedway in 1977. An exciting World Championship showdown between Williams-Honda teammates Nelson Piquet and Nigel Mansell was on the cards, and the Brazilian Piquet was 12 points ahead on points so the British Mansell was the man under pressure and in qualifying he cracked and crashed heavily at the fast Snake sweepers behind the paddock. The accident left Mansell with severe bruising to his backbone, re-triggering an old injury and it was decided that he should not be allowed to race. Having spent Friday night in hospital Mansell flew back to Europe on Saturday evening. Nelson Piquet was World Champion for the third time, his season-long consistency having paid dividends. The entry was much as it had been in Mexico although AGS decided to replace Pascal Fabre with Roberto Moreno. With Piquet having nothing to prove and Mansell out of the way Gerhard Berger took pole position in his Ferrari ahead of Alain Prost\\'s McLaren, Thierry Boutsen\\'s Benetton-Ford and Michele Alboreto in the second Ferrari. Then came Piquet and Teo Fabi (Benetton) with the top 10 completed by Ayrton Senna (Lotus), Riccardo Patrese (Brabham-BMW), Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren and the second Brabham of Andrea de Cesaris. In the race Berger took the lead at the start and was never threatened, winning a dominant victory; this was Ferrari\\'s first victory since the 1985 German Grand Prix. Boutsen chased Berger early on but dropped behind Senna, Piquet and Johansson. Piquet\\'s race ended with an engine failure in the closing laps and so fourth place went to Alboreto with Boutsen fifth and Satoru Nakajima sixth.\\n\\nSection::::Race 16: Australia.\\nThe last race of the year was at the demanding and punishing Adelaide street circuit in Australia. With Nigel Mansell out of action with injury after the Japanese GP, Williams did a deal with Brabham to use 1988 signing Riccardo Patrese for the final race of 1987 and Brabham took on youngster Stefano Modena as Patrese\\'s replacement. Otherwise the field was as before. Japanese GP winner Gerhard Berger was on pole position in his Ferrari from Alain Prost\\'s McLaren-TAG/Porsche, Nelson Piquet\\'s Williams-Honda and the Lotus-Honda of Ayrton Senna. Thierry Boutsen was fifth quickest in his Benetton-Ford ahead of Michele Alboreto\\'s Ferrari, Patrese\\'s Williams, Stefan Johansson\\'s McLaren, Teo Fabi\\'s Benetton and Andrea de Cesaris\\'s Brabham. Berger did as he had done in Japan, leading from flag to flag. He was chased initially by Piquet and Senna but the Lotus soon fell behind Prost. After the midrace pit stops Senna moved to second with Alboreto third. The final World Championship points went to Jonathan Palmer (Tyrrell) in fourth place, Yannick Dalmas (Larrousse Lola) in fifth and Roberto Moreno (AGS) in sixth. Senna was then disqualified for a weight infringement in his last race for Lotus.\\n\\nSection::::Results and standings.\\nSection::::World Drivers\\' Championship – final standings.\\nDrivers\\' Championship points were awarded on a 9–6–4–3–2–1 basis to the top six finishers in each round.

Mary wrote the blank verse drama and Percy contributed two lyric poems. Composed in 1820 while the Shelleys were living in Italy, it is often considered a partner to the Shelleys\\' play \"Midas\". \"Proserpine\" was first published in the London periodical \"The Winter\\'s Wreath\" in 1832. Whether the drama was ever intended to be staged is a point of debate among scholars.\\n\\nThe drama is based on Ovid\\'s tale of the abduction of Proserpine by Pluto, which itself was based on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone. Mary Shelley\\'s version focuses on the female characters. In a largely feminist retelling from Ceres\\'s point of view, Shelley emphasises the separation of mother and daughter and the strength offered by a community of women. Ceres represents life and love, and Pluto represents death and violence. The genres of the text also reflect gender debates of the time. Percy contributed in the lyric verse form traditionally dominated by men; Mary created a drama with elements common to early nineteenth-century women\\'s writing: details of everyday life and empathetic dialogue.\\n\\n\"Proserpine\" is part of a female literary tradition which, as feminist literary critic Susan Gubar describes it, has used the story of Ceres and Proserpine to \"re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself\". However, the play has been both neglected and marginalised by critics.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nIn March 1818 the Shelleys moved to Italy, where their two young children, Clara and William, soon died. Mary entered into a deep depression and became alienated from Percy. She recovered to some extent with the birth of Percy Florence later in 1819.\\n\\nBetween 1818 and 1820, she absorbed a considerable amount of drama, reading many of William Shakespeare\\'s plays, some with Percy. Percy believed that Mary had a talent for dramatic writing, and convinced her to study the great English, French, Latin, and Italian plays as well as dramatic theory. He even sought her advice on his play \"The Cenci\", and she transcribed the manuscript of his drama \"Prometheus Unbound\". The Shelleys also attended operas, ballets, and plays. Percy also encouraged Mary to translate Vittorio Alfieri\\'s play \"Mirra\" (1785), a tragedy about father-daughter incest which influenced her own novel \"Mathilda\".\\n\\nMary Shelley\\'s studies were broad during these years. She began to learn Greek in 1820 and read widely. She had also been reading Ovid\\'s \"Metamorphoses\" since at least 1815 and continued to do so in 1820. Her other reading included Jean-Jacques Rousseau\\'s philosophical treatise, \"\" (1762) and his sentimental novel, \"La Nouvelle Héloïse\" (1761), as well as Thomas Day\\'s children\\'s book \"The History of Sandford and Merton\" (1783–89). Critic Marjean Purinton notes that her reading around the time she was composing \"Proserpine\" included \"educational treatises and children\\'s literature, replete with moralisms concerning gendered behaviors\", as well as her mother Mary Wollstonecraft\\'s, \"Thoughts on the Education of Daughters\" (1787) and \"Original Stories from Real Life\" (1788). These latter were part of the conduct book tradition that challenged the gender roles of women.\\n\\nSection::::Composition and publication.\\nMary Shelley composed \"Proserpine\" in 1820, finishing it on 3 April according to her journal. Percy Shelley contributed two lyric poems: \"Arethusa\" and \"Song of Proserpine While Gathering Flowers on the Plain of Enna\". A fragment of the manuscript survives, housed in the Pforzheimer Collection at the New York Public Library, and demonstrates the couple working side-by-side on the project. According to their friend Thomas Medwin, Percy enjoyed the play, sometimes altering the manuscript as he was reading. In her biography of Mary Shelley, Miranda Seymour speculates that both \"Midas\" and \"Proserpine\" were written for two young girls Mary Shelley met and befriended, Laurette and Nerina Tighe, daughters of friends of the Shelleys in Italy. Their mother was also a former pupil of Mary Wollstonecraft, Mary Shelley\\'s mother. That same year, Mary Shelley wrote the children\\'s story \"Maurice\" for Laurette.\\n\\nIn 1824 Mary Shelley submitted \"Proserpine\" for publication to \"The Browning Box\", edited by Bryan Walter Procter, but it was rejected. The play was first published in 1832 in the London periodical \"The Winter\\'s Wreath\". She cut one-fifth of the play—about 120 lines—for this version, deleting some of the stories from the first act, including Percy\\'s poem \"Arethusa\", and rewrote individual lines. (She included \"Arethusa\" in her collection of \"Posthumous Poems\" of Percy Shelley in 1824.) Mary Shelley also added an ominous dream to the play, foreshadowing Proserpine\\'s abduction. Her efforts to publish the play in these periodicals and journal entries written during the play\\'s composition suggest that \"Proserpine\" was meant to be children\\'s literature.\\n\\nSection::::Plot summary.\\nAct I begins with Ceres leaving her daughter Proserpine in the protection of two nymphs, Ino and Eunoe, warning them not to wander. Proserpine asks Ino to tell her a story, and she recites the tale of Arethusa. After the story, the group gathers flowers. The two nymphs wander off, seeking ever more flowers, and lose sight of Proserpine. When they return, she is gone. They search for her in vain. Ceres returns, angry and frightened at the loss of her child:\\nAct II begins some time later. Ino laments: \"How all is changed since that unhappy eve! / Ceres forever weeps, seeking her child / And in her rage has struck the land with blight\". Arethusa comes, to tell Ceres that she saw Pluto make off with Proserpine. Ceres appeals to Jove for assistance, and Iris appears, saying that Proserpine\\'s fate is fixed. However, Jove agrees that if Proserpine does not eat the food of the Underworld, she can return. The group leaves to fetch Proserpine, who believes she has not consumed any tainted food, but she is reminded by Ascalaphus, a shade of the Underworld, of some pomegranate seeds that she ate. Ceres, Ino, and Arethusa volunteer to exile themselves to the Underworld, taking their treasures, such as fertility, with them. However, their sacrifice is not permitted. Iris relates Jove\\'s decision regarding Proserpine\\'s fate: \\n\\nCeres promises that only during the time when Proserpine lives with her will the earth be fertile.\\n\\nSection::::Genre.\\n\"Proserpine\" is a verse drama in blank verse by Mary Shelley which includes two lyric poems by Percy Shelley. In the early nineteenth century, lyric poetry was associated with male poets, and quotidian poetry (i.e., the poetry of the everyday) with female poets. The division of labour in \"Proserpine\" reflects this trend. Percy\\'s poems help emphasise the mythic nature of Proserpine\\'s story; he continued this transcendental description of Proserpine in his \"Prometheus Unbound\". Mary\\'s drama consists of carefully described objects, such as flowers. Furthermore, her characters do not speak in soliloquy—except in Percy\\'s poems—rather, \"nearly every speech is directed feelingly toward another character and is typically concerned with describing another\\'s emotional state, and/or eliciting an emotional reaction.\" Dialogue in \"Proserpine\" is founded on empathy, not the conflict more typical of drama. Mary Shelley also refused to embrace the visual sensationalism of early nineteenth-century theatre, focusing instead on \"scenes of heightened emotion\".\\n\\nScholars have disputed whether or not Mary Shelley intended her play to be staged. Most concur that it was never meant for performance, agreeing with Romanticist Alan Richardson that the play is \"lyrical drama\" or \"mental theater\" in the style of Romantic closet drama \"with its emphasis on character over plot, on reaction over action, and its turn away from the theater\". However, eighteenth-century theatrical scholar Judith Pascoe challenges this conclusion, pointing to detailed stage directions in the manuscript: \"Ceres and her companions are ranged on one side in eager expectation; from the cave on the other, enter Proserpine, attended by various dark & gloomy shapes bearing torches; among which Ascalaphus. Ceres & Persephone embrace;–her nymphs surround her.\" From this evidence, she argues that Shelley intended her play to be staged.\\n\\nLiterary scholar Jeffrey Cox has argued that \"Proserpine\", along with \"Midas\", \"Prometheus Unbound\" and other plays written by the Leigh Hunt circle, were \"not a rejection of the stage but an attempt to remake it\". Turning from the traditional genres of tragedy and comedy of manners, these writers reinvented drama by writing masques and pastoral dramas. He argues that \"Midas\" and \"Proserpine\" are a pair of mythological dramas that demonstrate \"the forces of oppression\". For him, \"Proserpine\" \"celebrates a pastoral world...threatened by male sexual violence and the tyranny of a sky god\".\\n\\nSection::::Themes.\\nMary Shelley expanded and revised the Roman poet Ovid\\'s story of Proserpine, which is part of his larger \"Metamorphoses\". The tale is based on the Greek myth of Demeter and Persephone, which explains the change of the seasons through Persephone\\'s visits to the Underworld: when she is confined to Hades\\'s realm, autumn and winter cover the earth, and when she returns to live with her mother, spring and summer bloom. The myth depicts the victory of male violence over female procreation. Like Percy Shelley, John Keats, and Lord Byron, Mary Shelley was interested in rewriting the classical myths; however, like other Romantic women writers, she was particularly interested in challenging their patriarchal themes. In revising the Proserpine myth, she placed women and their power at the centre of the narrative. For example, Ovid represents Proserpine as \"an unreflective child, willfully straying after flowers in infantile abandon\" while \"Shelley portrays Proserpine as a thoughtful, empathetic adolescent\" who wants to find flowers for her mother. Ovid\\'s version of the myth focuses on violence, particularly the abduction and rape of Proserpine, while Shelley\\'s play focuses on the suspenseful search for Proserpine. Her version highlights Ceres and the nymphs’ grief and Proserpine\\'s own desire to escape from the Underworld instead of the rape (the rape happens offstage). In contrast, other nineteenth-century adaptations often expanded the rape scene, romanticising it and turning it into a scene of courtship.\\n\\nWomen and women\\'s issues dominate Mary Shelley\\'s drama—no male characters appear, with the brief exception of Ascalaphus. However, as Romanticist Marjean Purinton argues, there is a strong masculine presence in the play even without male characters, suggesting \"the ubiquitous presence of patriarchal power in the domestic sphere\". Although the myth is fundamentally about rape and male tyranny, Shelley transforms it into a story about female solidarity and community—these women are storytellers and mythmakers who determine their own fate. Ceres\\'s love—a mother\\'s love—challenges the power of the gods. Shelley tells the story almost entirely from Ceres\\'s point of view; \"her play elegiacally praises female creativity and fecundity as ‘Leaf, and blade, and bud, and blossom.’\\xa0\" Shelley writes active, rather than passive, roles for Proserpine and Ceres. For example, it is Ceres\\'s anger, not her grief, that brings \"winter\\'s blight\". However, Proserpine\\'s abduction is prefigured in the story of Arethusa and, as literary scholar Julie Carlson points out, the women can only join together after Proserpine has been abducted.\\n\\nIn Shelley\\'s version of the myth, paradise is lost not through the fault of women but through the interference of men. Pluto\\'s \"egotistical, predatory violence\" is juxtaposed with Ceres\\'s \"loving kindness, her willingness to sustain life, [and] her unswerving devotion to her child\". Sex, in this myth, is represented as a separation from the feminine and a forced surrender to the masculine. Pluto\\'s domination of Proserpine symbolises \"a culture based on acquisition and brutality, a culture that covertly justifies (when it does not overtly celebrate) male mastery\".\\n\\n\"Proserpine\" and \"Midas\" are often seen as a pair of contrasting plays. \"Proserpine\" is a play of female bonding, while \"Midas\" is a male-dominated drama; male poets participate in a contest in \"Midas\" while in \"Proserpine\" female characters participate in communal storytelling; \"where Midas lives in his golden palace imagining himself at the center of an all-powerful court, Ceres laments leaving the pastoral enclave she shares with Proserpine for Jove\\'s court\"; Midas focuses on gold, while the women in \"Proserpine\" enjoy flowers; and \"where the society of \"Midas\" is marked by egotism, greed, and strife, the female society of \"Proserpine\" values community, gift-giving, and love\".\\n\\nSection::::Legacy and reception.\\nAs feminist literary critic Susan Gubar argues, Mary Shelley\\'s drama is part of a female literary tradition, including Elizabeth Barrett Browning, H.D., Toni Morrison, Margaret Atwood, and Doris Lessing, which has responded to the story of Ceres and Proserpine. These writers use the myth as a \"way of dealing with their experience of themselves as daughters growing up into womanhood and potential motherhood...they use the myth of Demeter and Persephone to re-define, to re-affirm and to celebrate female consciousness itself.\" Poets such as Dorothy Wellesley, Rachel Annand Taylor, Babette Deutsch, and Helen Wolfert as well as Mary Shelley portray the procreative mother as a heroine who creates an arena for nurturing relationships that challenge \"the divisions between self and other\" that rest at the centre of patriarchy. Feminist poet Adrienne Rich writes that \"the loss of the daughter to the mother, the mother to the daughter, is the essential female tragedy\", and it is this tragedy that Mary Shelley discusses in her play.\\n\\nWhen A. Koszul first published a transcription of \"Proserpine\" in 1922, he argued \"that the little classical fancies which Mrs. Shelley never ventured to publish are quite as worthy of consideration as her more ambitious prose works\". However, his \"Introduction\" to the play speaks mostly of Percy Shelley and his contribution to Mary Shelley\\'s works. In fact, as he explains, he decided to publish to contribute to the Percy Shelley centenary. Since their original publication, neither \"Midas\" nor \"Proserpine\" has received much critical attention. Critics have either paid attention only to Percy Shelley\\'s poems, or have ignored the plays altogether. Literary critic Elizabeth Nitchie writes that the plays are \"distinguished only by the lyrics that [Percy] Shelley wrote for them\", and Sylvia Norman contends that they \"do not really call for analytical and comparative study\". While \"Frankenstein\" has remained a powerful cultural force since its publication, Mary Shelley\\'s other works have rarely been reprinted and scholars have focused almost exclusively on Mary Shelley, author of \"Frankenstein\", and Mary Shelley, wife of Percy Bysshe Shelley. However, with the publication of works by Mary Poovey and Anne K. Mellor in the 1980s and \"The Other Mary Shelley\" in 1993, more attention has been paid to Mary Shelley\\'s \"other\" works, such as her dramas.\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Proserpine (play)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11418750'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'HRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11420687', 'text': 'James O.

Alongside \"R. oryzae, R. microsporus\" causes the premier head rot of sunflower in South Africa. Susceptibility to disease changes throughout the age of the host. The initial symptoms appear as small, dispersed water-soaked spots on the back of the sunflower head. As the spots expand, mycelial growth expands into parenchyma cells, further killing cells within the head. Later stages of disease have external masses of mycelium among clumps of black sporangia, dispersing spores abiotically, and by birds. The diseased heads can completely rot in 3 to 7 days.\\n\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" has been found to be the species involved in Rhizopus Ear Rot of maize as well. This is characterized by small spotted sporangia structures, mycelium growth on the ear, and eventual ear and grain rot.\\n\\nSection::::Disease cycle.\\nThe life cycle of \"R. microsporus\" is quite similar to the general life cycles of common \"Rhizopus\" species.The primary feature as a plant pathogen is the intake of resources from a plant host. The initial infection occurs from asexual spores overwintered in plant debris. These spores infect the host where susceptibility is best, such as young roots of rice seedlings, or the mature sunflower head. Once infected, the production of hyphae and mycelium continue to spread the infection, creating sporangia as a secondary cycle. The resources gathered are a result of the symbiotic relationship with \"Burkholderia\" species, allowing for rhizoxin production to kill plant cells.\\n\\nA sexual stage is present, in the same fashion as most zygomycetes, with fused hyphae of alternate mating types producing a zygospore.\\n\\nThere is an upcoming theory in \"R. microsporus\" that suggests that a portion of the reproductive cycle is replaced when put in symbiosis with the rhizoxin producing bacteria.\\n\\nSection::::Environment.\\nThis fungus is most commonly found in soil, plant debris, and foodstuffs. It is a pathogen of many crops and therefore is found in many diverse environments. \"R. microsporus\" is generally found in soils with a neutral pH. These soil levels usually have lower salinity for optimum growth conditions. The growth range of \"R. microsporus\" ranges from 25℃ to 55℃ with an optimal temperature of 28℃. Its primary host is rice and it is also commonly found in maize and sunflowers. \"R. microsporus\" causes disease in humans, one of its alternative hosts, causing infections of the lungs. In one rare case it was found tainting hospital linens in Hong Kong leading to a scare that brought the disease into the forefront of mainstream media.\\n\\nSection::::Management.\\nThe management of \"R. microsporus\" can be either complete sterilization, antifungal use, or the blocking of sporulation so it cannot spread. This fungal-bacterial symbiont is classified as a biosafety level 2 organism. A common method of sterilization is getting rid of all of the reproductive structures of the fungus. More difficult sterilizations oftentimes requires control agents such as antifungals are employed. However, \"R. microsporus\" is also naturally resistant to fluconazole, ketoconazole, voriconazole and the echinocandins. Antifungal prescription drugs that usually will control \"R. microsporus\" are amphotericin B and triazoles such as posaconazole, it’s also occasionally susceptible to itraconazole. Another way to control this pathogen would be to eliminate its bacterial endosymbiont, without this endosymbiont the fungus is unable to sporulate.\\n\\nThe bacteria has a type III secretion system that allows it to communicate with its fungal host, and without the bacterias\\' secretion system, the fungi could not produce spores. This bacterium is passed on vertically from fungus to fungus through the sporangia while these spores are germinating. Without the bacteria none of the reproductive structures can be created by the fungus.\\n\\nSection::::Importance.\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" causes rice seedling blight and is a severe crop disease in Asia.\\n\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" is also one of very few fungi that harbors bacterial endosymbionts to control its production of toxins. Understanding the evolutionary association between \"R. microsporus\" and \"B. rhizoxinica\" and how the symbiosis is maintained has been an area of interest. In all cases, it is obvious that the fungus profits from the biosynthetic capabilities of the endosymbiont in order to access nutrient sources. Yet, the advantage for the bacterial symbiont is not evident.\\n\\nSporulation does not occur without the presence of both \"B. rhizoxinica\" and R. microsporus. The T3SS involved in this relationship is the first report on a T3SS involved in bacterial–fungal symbiosis. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the T3SS represents a prototype of a clade of uncharacterized T3SSs within the \"hrp\" superfamily of T3SSs from plant pathogenic microorganisms.\\n\\nSection::::Pathogenesis.\\n\"Rhizopus microsporus\" lives as a necrotroph where both the fungus (\"Rhizopus microsporus\") and its harbored endobacteria (\"Burkholderia rhizoxinica\") form a symbiotic relationship. In order to kill the living cells of its host, the harbored endobacteria secrete rhizoxin, a toxin that inhibits cell mitosis and vegetative production. \"R. microsporus\" has developed a resistance to the toxin due to an amino acid exchange in the β-tubulin protein. The resulting necrosis of the plant tissue replenishes nutrients to both the fungus and the bacteria by feeding on the decaying matter.\\n\\nThe virulence factor in all known cases are biosynthesized by the pathogenic fungus. In this case of the symbiosis between \"R. microsporus\" and \"B. rhizoxinica\", the hosted bacteria population produces the causative agent of rice seedling blight. Toxin formation by the bacteria has been demonstrated in analogy with Koch\\'s postulates through the discovery that rhizoxin-producing strains of \"R. microsporus\" contained symbionts. Removal of the symbionts from the host degraded rhizoxin production and the symbionts were then grown in pure culture. Lastly, the re-introduction of the bacteria grown in pure culture back into the host reestablished rhizoxin production.\\n\\nThe maintenance of the symbiosis is crucial for sporulation to occur. The endofungal bacteria possess a type III secretion system (T3SS) in order to achieve symbiosis. Mutants defective in the T3SS mechanism show reduced intracellular survival and no sporulation. This T3SS is a pathogenicity factor that is required by the pathogen in order to cause disease.\\n', 'title': 'Rhizopus microsporus', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11420926'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'IRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1142319', 'text': 'Greek National Road 6\\n\\nGreek National Road 6 (, abbreviated as EO6) is a national road in north-central Greece.

The earliest traces of human settlement in Estonia are connected with Kunda culture. The oldest known settlement in Estonia is the Pulli settlement, which was located on the banks of the river Pärnu, near the town of Sindi, in southwestern Estonia. It has been dated to the beginning of the 9th millennium BC. The Kunda Culture received its name from the \"Lammasmäe\" settlement site in northern Estonia, which dates from earlier than 8500. Bone and stone artifacts similar to those found at Kunda have been discovered elsewhere in Estonia, as well as in Latvia, northern Lithuania and southern Finland. Among minerals flint and quartz was used the most for making cutting tools.\\n\\nSection::::The Neolithic Period.\\nThe beginning of the Neolithic period is marked by the ceramics of the Narva culture, which appears in Estonia at the beginning of the 5th millennium BC. The oldest finds date from around 4900 BC. The first pottery was made of thick clay mixed with pebbles, shells or plants. The Narva type ceramics are found throughout almost the entire Estonian coastal region and on the islands. The stone and bone tools of the era have a notable similarity with the artifacts of the Kunda culture.\\n\\nArtifacts identified as belonging to the \"Comb Ceramic Culture\" have been found at sites from Northern Finland to Eastern Prussia. Burials associated with the culture often include figures of animals, birds, snakes and humans carved from bone and amber beginning from the middle of the 4th millennium BC. Until the early 1980s, the scholarly consensus held that the appearance of Comb Ceramic culture artifacts was associated with the arrival of Finnic peoples (ancestors of the Estonians, Finns, and Livonians) on the shores of the Baltic Sea. However, such a linking of archaeologically defined cultural entities with ethno-linguistic ones is no longer assumed to be a given. An alternative hypothesis is that the increase of settlement finds in the period may have been associated with an economic boom related to the warming of climate. Some researchers have even argued that a Uralic language may have been spoken in Estonia and Finland since the end of the last glaciation.\\n\\nSection::::Late Neolithic - Chalcolithic.\\nThe beginning of the Late Neolithic Period about 2200 BC is characterized by the appearance of the Corded Ware culture, pottery with corded decoration and well-polished stone axes (s.c. boat-shape axes). Evidence of agriculture is provided by charred grain of wheat on the wall of a corded-ware vessel found in Iru settlement. Osteological analysis show an attempt was made to domesticate the wild boar.\\n\\nSpecific burial customs were characterized by the dead being laid on their sides with their knees pressed against their breast, one hand under the head. Objects placed into the graves were made of bones of domesticated animals.\\n\\nSection::::The Bronze Age.\\nThe beginning of the Bronze Age in Estonia is dated to approximately 1800 BC. The development of the borders between the Finnic peoples and the Balts was under way. The first fortified settlements, Asva and Ridala on the island of Saaremaa and Iru in the Northern Estonia began to be built. The development of shipbuilding facilitated the spread of bronze. Changes took place in burial customs, a new type of burial ground spread from Germanic to Estonian areas, stone cist graves and cremation burials became increasingly common aside small number of boat-shaped stone graves.\\n\\nSection::::The Iron Age.\\nThe Pre-Roman Iron Age began in Estonia about 500 BC and lasted until the middle of the 1st century BC. The oldest iron items were imported, although since the 1st century iron was smelted from local marsh and lake ore. Settlement sites were located mostly in places that offered natural protection. Fortresses were built, although used temporarily. The appearance of square Celtic fields surrounded by enclosures in Estonia date from the Pre-Roman Iron Age. The majority of stones with man-made indents, which presumably were connected with magic designed to increase crop fertility, date from this period. A new type of grave, quadrangular burial mounds began to develop. Burial traditions show the clear beginning of social stratification.\\n\\nThe Roman Iron Age in Estonia is roughly dated to between 50 and 450 AD, the era that was affected by the influence of the Roman Empire. In material culture this is reflected by few Roman coins, some jewellery and artefacts. The abundance of iron artifacts in Southern Estonia speaks of closer mainland ties with southern areas while the islands of western and northern Estonia communicated with their neighbors mainly by sea. By the end of the period three clearly defined tribal dialectical areas: Northern Estonia, Southern Estonia, and Western Estonia (including the islands) had emerged, the population of each having formed its own understanding of identity.\\n\\nSection::::Early Middle Ages.\\nThe name of Estonia occurs first in a form of Aestii in the 1st century AD by Tacitus. However, at this stage it probably indicated Baltic tribes living in the area of Western Lithuania and the present-day Kaliningrad. In the Norse sagas (13th century) the term apparently was used to indicate the Estonians.\\n\\nAccording to one interpretation, Ptolemy in his \"Geography III\" in the middle of the 2nd century AD mentions the Osilians among other dwellers on the Baltic shore.\\n\\nThe extent of Estonian territory in early medieval times is disputed but the nature of their religion is not. They were known to the Scandinavians as experts in wind-magic, as were the Lapps (known at the time as Finns) in the North. The name Estonia is first mentioned by Cassiodorus in his book V. Letters 1–2 dating from the 6th century.\\n\\nSaxo Grammaticus describes the Curonians and Estonians as participating in the Battle of Bråvalla on the side of the Swedes against the Danes, who were aided by the Livonians and the Wends of Pomerania. It is notable that other Baltic tribes — i.e., the Letts and Lithuanians — are not mentioned by Saxo as participating in the fight.\\nSnorri Sturluson relates in his \"Ynglinga saga\" how the Swedish king Ingvar (7th century), the son of Östen and a great warrior, who was forced to patrol the shores of his kingdom fighting Estonian pirates. The saga speaks of his invasion of Estonia where he fell in a battle against the men of \"Estland\" who had come down with a great army. After the battle, King Ingvar was buried close to the seashore in Estonia and the Swedes returned home.\\n\\nAccording to Heimskringla sagas, in the year 967 the Norwegian Queen Astrid escaped with her son, in future king of Norway Olaf Tryggvason from her homeland to Novgorod, where her brother Sigurd held an honoured position at the court of Prince Vladimir. On their journey, \"Eistland\" (Oeselian?) Vikings raided the ship, killing some of the crew and taking others into slavery. Six years later, when Sigurd Eirikson traveled to \"Eistland\" to collect taxes on behalf of \"Valdemar\" (Vladimir), he spotted Olaf in a market in an unmentioned city and paid for his freedom.\\n\\nA battle between Oeselian and Icelandic Vikings off Saaremaa is described in Njál\\'s saga as occurring in 972 AD.\\n\\nAbout 1008, Olaf the Holy, later king of Norway, landed on Saaremaa. The Oesilians, taken by surprise, had at first agreed to pay the demands made by Olaf, but then gathered an army during the negotiations and attacked the Norwegians. Olaf (who would have been only 13 years old) claimed to have won the battle. Olaf was the subject of several biographies, both hagiographies and sagas, in the Middle Ages, and many of the historical facts concerning his adventures are disputed.\\n\\nThe Chudes as mentioned in Old East Slavic chronicles are in early context usually considered as Baltic Finns in north-western Rus or even as all non-Slavic people in north-eastern Europe, but since 11th century mainly as Estonians. According to Primary Chronicle the Chudes where one of the founders of the Rus\\' state in 9th century. According to Nestor Yaroslav I the Wise invaded the country of the Chuds in 1030 and laid the foundations of Yuriev, (the historical Russian name of Tartu, Estonia).\\n\\nAccording to the Novgorod Chronicle, Varyag Ulf (Uleb) from Novgorod was crushed in battle at \"Iron Gate\", which is usually located in norther Russia, but according to one hypothesis took place on sea close to the Tallinn Bay in 1032.\\n\\nIn the 1st centuries AD political and administrative subdivisions began to emerge in Estonia. Two larger subdivisions appeared: the parish (\"kihelkond\") and the county (\"maakond\"). The parish consisted of several villages. Nearly all parishes had at least one fortress. The defense of the local area was directed by the highest official, the parish elder. The county was composed of several parishes, also headed by an elder. By the 13th century the following major counties had developed in Estonia: Saaremaa (Osilia), Läänemaa (Rotalia or Maritima), Harjumaa (Harria), Rävala (Revalia), Virumaa (Vironia), Järvamaa (Jervia), Sakala (Saccala), and Ugandi (Ugaunia).\\n\\nEstonia constitutes one of the richest territories in the Baltic for hoards from the 11th and the 12th centuries. The earliest coin hoards found in Estonia are Arabic Dirhams from the 8th century. The largest Viking Age hoards found in Estonia have been at Maidla and Kose. Out of the 1500 coins published in catalogues, 1000 are Anglo-Saxon.\\nVarbola Stronghold () was one of the largest circular rampart fortress and trading center built in Estonia, Harju County () at the time.\\n\\nIn the 11th century the Scandinavians are frequently chronicled as combating the Vikings from the eastern shores of the Baltic Sea. \\nWith the rise of Christianity, centralized authority in Scandinavia and Germany eventually lead to Baltic crusades.\\nThe east Baltic world was transformed by military conquest: First the Livs, Letts and Estonians, then the Prussians and the Finns underwent defeat, baptism, military occupation and sometimes extermination by groups of Germans, Danes and Swedes.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Ancient Estonia', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11432901'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'JBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11436789', 'text': 'William E.

The method is a waterfall model divided in seven phases that have a clear start and end. Each phase delivers (sub)products, called milestones. It was used extensively in the Netherlands for ICT projects in the 1980s and 1990s. PANDATA was purchased by the Capgemini group in the 1980s, and the last version of SDM to be published in English was SDM2 (6th edition) in 1991 by CAP GEMINI PUBLISHING BV.

SDM, SDM2, SDM/70, and Spectrum evolved into system development methodologies that were based on the works of Steven Ward, Tom Demarco, Larry Constantine, Ken Orr, Ed Yourdon, Michael A. Jackson and others, as well as data modeling techniques developed by Thomas Bachmann and Peter Chen. SDM is a top-down model. Starting from the system as a whole, its description becomes more detailed as the design progresses. The method was marketed as a proprietary method that all company developers were required to use to ensure quality in customer projects. This method shows several similarities with the proprietary methods of CAP Gemini\\'s most important competitors in 1990. A similar waterfall method that was later used against the company itself in court proceedings in 2002 was CMG:Commander.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSDM was developed in 1970 by a company known as PANDATA, now part of Cap Gemini, which itself was created as a joint venture by three Dutch companies: AKZO, Nationale Nederlanden and PTT. The company was founded in order to develop the method and create training materials to propagate the method. It was successful, but was revised in 1987 to standardize and separate the method theory from the more technical aspects used to implement the method. Those aspects were bundled into the process modelling tool called Software Development Workbench (SDW), that was later sold in 2000 to BWise, another Dutch company. This revised version of the method without the tool is commonly known as SDM2.\\n\\nSection::::Main difference between SDM and SDM2.\\nSDM2 was a revised version of SDM that attempted to solve a basic problem that occurred often in SDM projects; the delivered system failed to meet the customer requirements. Though any number of specific reasons for this could arise, the basic waterfall method used in SDM was a recipe for this problem due to the relatively large amount of time spent by development teams between the Definition Study and the Implementation phases. It was during the design phases that the project often became out of sync with customer requirements.\\n\\nDuring the SDM functional design phase called BD (Basic Design), design aspects were documented (out of phase) in detail for the later technical design DD (Detailed Design). This caused a gray zone of responsibility to occur between the two phases; the functional crew responsible for the data flows and process flows in the BD were making decisions that the technical crew later needed to code, although their technical knowledge wasn\\'t detailed enough to make those decisions. This obviously led to problems in collaboration between project teams during both the BD and DD phases. Because of the waterfall method of Go/No Go decisions at the end of each phase, the technical crew would have to make a formal Change request in order to make corrections in the detailed sections of the Basic Design. Such changes were often confusing for the customer, because these originated from the project team rather than directly from the customer requirements, \"even after a change freeze was put in place\". Usually the customer was only allowed to produce requirements up to and including the functional design in the BD phase. After that, the customer had to wait patiently until acceptance testing in the Implementation phase.\\n\\nIn SDM2, the term \"Basic Design\" was replaced by the term \"Global Design\" to indicate that this document was continuously updated and subject to change during both the BD and DD phases. Thus the \"Basic design\" is both global and detailed at the end of the project. In the global design, the principles of functionality and construction, as well as their relations, are documented. This is how the idea of iterative development got started; a functional design is by nature influenced by the technology platform chosen for implementation, and some basic design decisions will need to be revisited when early assumptions prove later to be wrong or costly to implement. This became the forerunner of the Rapid Application Development method, which caused these two phases to become cyclical and work in tandem.\\n\\nSDM2 only partially solved the problem of meeting customer requirements; modern software development methods go several steps further by insisting for example on incremental deliveries, or that the customer appoint key users of the delivered system to play a role in the project from start to finish.\\n\\nSection::::The SDM method.\\nSDM is a method based on phases. Before every phase, an agreement needs to be reached detailing the activities for that phase. These documents are known as milestone documents. Several uses for these documents exist:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Phases.\\nThe method uses 7 phases which are successively executed, like the waterfall model. The phases are:\\n\\n\\nUpon completion of a phase, it is decided whether to go on to the next phase or not; the terms \\'Go\\' and \\'NO-GO\\' are used for this. The next phase will not start until a \\'Go\\' is given, while if there is a \\'NO-GO\\', the project either stays in the current phase to be improved or is canceled completely.\\n\\nSection::::Information planning (IP).\\nIn this phase, the problems that have to be solved by the project are defined. The current and desired situations are analysed, and goals for the project are decided upon. In this phase, it is important to consider the needs of all parties, such as future users and their management. Often, their expectations clash, causing problems later during development or during use of the system.\\n\\nSection::::Definition study (DS).\\nIn this phase, a more in-depth study of the project is made. The organization is analysed to determine their needs and determine the impact of the system on the organization. The requirements for the system are discussed and decided upon. The feasibility of the project is determined. Aspects that can be considered to determine feasibility are:\\n\\n\\nSection::::Basic Design (BD).\\nIn this phase, the design for the product is made. After the definition study has determined what the system needs to do, the design determines how this will be done. This often results in two documents: The functional design, or User interface design explaining what each part of the system does, and the high-level technical design, explaining how each part of the system is going to work. This phase combines the functional and technical design and only gives a broad design for the whole system. Often, the architecture of the system is described here.\\n\\nSDM2 split this step in two parts, one for the BD phase, and one for the DD phase, in order to create a Global Design document.\\n\\nSection::::Detailed Design (DD).\\nIn this phase, the design for the product is described technically in the jargon needed for software developers (and later, the team responsible for support of the system in the O&S phase). After the basic design has been signed off, the technical detailed design determines how this will be developed with software. This often results in a library of source documentation: The functional design per function, and the technical design per function, explaining how each part of the system is going to work, and how they relate to each other. \\n\\nIn SDM2, this phase elaborates on the Global Design by creating more detailed designs, or further refining existing detailed designs, to the point where they can be used to build the system itself.\\n\\nSection::::Realization (R).\\nIn this phase, the design is converted to a working system. The actual way this is done will depend on the system used. Where in older systems programmers often had to write all of the code, newer systems allow the programmers to convert the design into code directly, leaving less work to be done and a smaller chance for errors. At the same type, the system becomes more reliant on the design—if the design has been properly tested, the proper code will be generated, but if the design is not fully correct, the code will be incorrect without a programmer to look for such problems.\\n\\nSection::::Implementation (I).\\nThe implementation, or testing phase consists of two steps: a system test and an acceptance test.\\n\\nDuring the system test the development team—or a separate testing team—tests the system. Most of this will be focused on the technical aspects: does the system work as it should, or are there bugs still present? Bugs that are found in this phase will be fixed. At the ending of this phase, the program should work properly.\\n\\nDuring the acceptance test, the end-users will test the system. They will test to see if the program does what they want it to do. They will not test every possible scenario, but they will test to see if the program does what they want and expect it to do and that it works in an easy way. Bugs that are found in this phase will be reported to the development team so that they can fix these bugs.\\n\\nDuring this phase, the final version of the system is implemented by the organization: the hardware is set up, the software is installed, end user documentation is created and, end users trained to use the program, existing data is entered into the system.\\n\\nSection::::Operation and Support (O & S).\\nOnce the system has been implemented, it is used within the organization. During its lifetime, it needs to be kept running and possibly enhanced.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Cap Gemini SDM', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11441217'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'KhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1144316', 'text': 'MacPherson, Singapore\\n\\nMacPherson is a neighbourhood located in Geylang in the Central Region of Singapore. Its location roughly corresponds to the similarly titled subzone of Macpherson in the Geylang Planning Area and is approximately sandwiched between the neighbourhoods of Aljunied and Paya Lebar. MacPherson largely consists of a small public housing estate centered on Circuit Road and an industrial area. The neighbourhood is served by the Circle MRT Line and Downtown Line at MacPherson MRT Station and Mattar MRT Station.\\n\\nSection::::Etymology.\\nFormerly called \"Jalan Klapa\", MacPherson Road was named after Lieutenant Colonel Ronald MacPherson (1817-1869). \\n\\nMacPherson served in the China War of 1841 and was appointed Staff Officer to the Artillery in the Straits in 1843. He succeeded Colonel H. Man as Executive Engineer and Superintendent of Convicts and Resident Councillor, Malacca in 1855 and 1857 respectively. He had been active in forming a local volunteer corps at the outbreak of the Crimean War and was appointed First Captain Commandment of the Singapore Volunteer Rifle Corps formed in 1854. When the first Municipal Act came into operation in 1856, he became an ex officio member of the Commission, becoming President on three later occasions. He was appointed the first Colonial Secretary when the Straits Settlements became a Crown Colony in 1867.\\n\\nMacPherson designed the current St Andrew\\'s Cathedral along the lines of Netley Abbey in England and built it in six years using Indian convict labour. Completed in 1862, the cathedral is considered one of the finest specimens of ecclesiastical architecture in the east. On the cathedral grounds, the architect is commemorated in a memorial called the MacPherson Memorial Monument. He was buried in the old Bukit Timah Road Christian Cemetery, which has since been landscaped and made into a park.\\n\\nThe name Macpherson -- or MacPherson or McPherson, according to different spellings -- comes from the Gaelic Mac a\\' phearsain and means \\'Son of the parson\\'.

The town had a population in 2001 of 6,107, increasing to 6,519 at the 2011 Census.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe town was largely a small farming settlement until the industrial revolution and the sinking of collieries caused a boom in population and a need for modern housing for the workforce. This has left a town with a mixture of stone and brick buildings. The town and its neighbours were mentioned in the \"Domesday Book\". Other industries such as quarrying for stone, agriculture and brick manufacture were also known at different periods of the town\\'s history, with many of the former buildings and sites associated with them still existing.\\n\\nSection::::Former quarry site.\\nThe former South Elmsall quarry was deemed a site of national importance, by Defra, due to the visible section of an unusually complete patch coral reef.\\n\\nSection::::Coal mining.\\nThe town is most famous for its coal-mining past; it was the site of Frickley Colliery, which was one of the largest deep coal mines in the United Kingdom. The colliery invested in several improvements that were of benefit to the area, including the building of the Warde Aldam Hospital, as well as swimming baths and sports facilities.\\n\\nThe colliery became a key source of union radicalism. During the UK Miners\\' Strike, there were numerous disturbances in the area. It was one of the last pits to return to work after the strike, seeing as it was picketed by a group of hardliners from Kent who continued to picket Frickley after the NUM had called off the strike. The Frickley miners refused to cross the hardliners\\' picket.\\n\\nThe colliery was closed on 26 November 1993 following closures of nearby pits like Ferrymoor-Riddings (1985), Kinsley (1986), South Kirkby (1988) and Grimethorpe (1992). In 1998 the UK Governments \"Social Exclusion Unit\" published a series of \"Policy Action Team\" reports looking at issues of social exclusion. The Skills report used South Elmsall and surrounding towns as a case study and stated \"The local communities still suffer from serious\\nenvironmental, social and economic problems - and a crisis of morale - as a result of the loss of jobs in the mining industry\". \\n\\nSection::::Warde-Aldam Hospital.\\nThe Warde-Aldam Hospital was a hospital situated in South Elmsall, Yorkshire, England. It was built in 1911 by Carlton Main Colliery Ltd and was used as a general, voluntary hospital until 1948. It was then taken over by the NHS and provided acute hospital care until 1978.\\n\\nSection::::Music.\\nThe town is home to Carlton Main Frickley Colliery Band, a successful brass band who have previously been British and European champions.\\n\\nSection::::Frickley Country Park.\\nFrickley Country Park officially opened in September 2009, after a long period of land reclamation, environmental cleaning and landscaping of the former Frickley Colliery site was finished. The site offers walks and play areas as well as space for new housing development as part of the wider regeneration scheme. Nearby is located the Frickley Off-road Centre, a specialist facility for motorsports.\\n\\nSection::::Local economy.\\nThe large, traditional market is a central feature of the shopping area of the town, with approximately 105 trading stalls. On the main high street there are shops featuring many household names such as The Post Office, Hallmark Cards, Specsavers, Boots Group and Greggs alongside many other independent shops offering a range of goods and services such as travel, boutique fashion, wedding dress hire, sportswear and much more.\\n\\nOn the outskirts of the town is the Dale Lane Industrial Estate which is home to a number of large, internationally recognised companies. For example, there are a number of Next Distribution warehouses. The estate itself reflects the change in industry of the area, being one of the key expansion areas since the closure of the local collieries.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nCarlton, Moorthorpe, Northfield and Ash Grove are the primary education schools in South Elmsall. The main source of secondary and further education in the town is Minsthorpe Community College, which also provides places to residents of South Kirkby and Upton. In 2008 Minsthorpe Community College gained its best ever results at all levels – KS3/GCSE/A-Level, the college GCSE results are higher than the local and national averages.\\n\\nThe school also hosts a number of other facilities such as a sports and fitness suite, all weather floodlit sports pitches, a gym and an upcoming public swimming pool. The school and its science and sporting facilities were upgraded as one of the host training facilities for the London 2012 Olympic Games.\\n\\nAmong a number of well known people who have an association with Minsthorpe include playwright John Godber, actors Adrian Hood and Chris Walker and footballers Jamie and John McCombe.\\n\\nSection::::Transport.\\nSouth Elmsall is served by rail, the nearest stations being South Elmsall railway station. The main bus station is also situated beside the railway station.\\n\\nSection::::Churches.\\nThe principal places of Christian worship include:\\n\\nNon-Christian places of religious/spiritual interest:\\n\\nSection::::Sports.\\nFrickley Athletic are based in South Elmsall.

She served in the cabinets of Kathleen Wynne and Dalton McGuinty.\\n\\nSection::::Background.\\nPrior to entering politics, she was a lawyer, community activist and volunteer. Broten attended McMaster University from 1986 to 1990, and has both a Bachelor of Arts and a Bachelor of Science degree from the institution. She also received an LL.B. from the University of Western Ontario in 1993. She was a law clerk to Madam Justice Claire L\\'Heureux-Dubé at the Supreme Court of Canada from 1993 to 1994, and later had a practice in civil and commercial litigation. She has also served as Chair of the Board of Directors for the Gatehouse, a community centre for survivors of child abuse.\\n\\nIn 2007, Broten and her husband were criticized after they applied for a permit to build a large two-storey garage behind their home. Dubbed the \"garage mahal\" by neighbours, the structure was meant to hold the couple\\'s four vehicles. The plan was notable at the time due to Broten\\'s position as the Minister of the Environment. Following a public outcry and stories in the media, plans to build the garage were cancelled.\\n\\nBroten, her husband, and their two children moved to Halifax, Nova Scotia in 2013.\\n\\nSection::::Provincial politics.\\nBroten ran for the Ontario legislature in the provincial election of 1999, but was defeated by Progressive Conservative Morley Kells in Etobicoke-Lakeshore by 5,156 votes. She ran again in the 2003 election, and defeated Kells by 6,722 votes amid a provincial shift to the Liberals.\\n\\nSection::::38th Legislative Assembly.\\nOn October 23, 2003, she was named as the Parliamentary Assistant to Premier Dalton McGuinty. In this role she conducted province-wide consultations to develop meaningful reforms to address domestic violence in Ontario. This led to the Government’s Domestic Violence Action Plan which included a groundbreaking public education campaign. She also chaired the Premier’s Shared Air Summit, which drew scientists and policy makers from across North America to tackle the linked issues of smog and transboundary air pollution.\\n\\nShe introduced two private member bills in 2004. The first, entitled \"Kids First Licences Act\", proposed to allow drivers to make charitable donations to children\\'s charities whenever they renewed their vehicle licence. The second, called \"Workplace Violence and Workplace Harassment\" (an amendment to the \"Occupational Health and Safety Act\"), proposed to impose additional duties and responsibilities in workplaces.\\n\\nOn June 29, 2005, Broten was appointed to cabinet as Minister of the Environment. As minister, she developed policies under one of Canada’s most comprehensive Climate Change Plans in an effort to reduce greenhouse gas emissions. She also introduced the Clean Water Act designed to better safeguard Ontario’s drinking water.\\n\\nSection::::39th Legislative Assembly.\\nBroten was re-elected in 2007, and was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. While there, she authored a report detailing a Five Point Action Plan to create more opportunities and reduce barriers for internationally trained doctors in Ontario. Her report formed the basis for new legislation in 2008.\\n\\nIn 2008, she introduced legislation that imposes a duty to report images of child abuse. The following year she unanimously passed a resolution calling for a review of reporting standards for listed companies.\\n\\nIn 2009, Broten was appointed Parliamentary Assistant to the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure. On October 7 that year, she was appointed Minister of Children and Youth Services and Minister Responsible for Women\\'s Issues.\\n\\nSection::::40th Legislative Assembly.\\nIn 2011, Broten was re-elected again.

The following year she was hired by the provincial government, headed by Liberal Premier Stephen McNeil, to conduct a tax review. In January 2015, she was appointed President and CEO of Nova Scotia Business Inc.\\n\\nSection::::Post-political career.\\nAfter she resigned from the Ontario Cabinet and legislature, Broten and her family eventually settled in Hammonds Plains, Nova Scotia. She had initially stated that she was moving to Halifax, for her husband Paul obtained a job at Emera as special counsel for senior projects.\\n\\nNot long after Nova Scotia Premier Stephen McNeil\\'s Liberal Party swept to electoral victory, she was hired as a government consultant to lead a comprehensive review of the taxation in the province. Her final report, released on November 19, 2014, made 22 recommendations on taxation; these included eliminating the tax bracket for high-income ($150,000 and over) earners, eliminating refundable tax credits, eliminating a tax rebate for seniors, reducing corporate taxes for large businesses, introducing a carbon tax and expanding the HST to include numerous exempt products including books, children\\'s clothes, diapers, and feminine hygiene products. Broten\\'s report was generally panned, and Nova Scotia Finance Minister Diana Whalen subsequently scheduled several public consultations across the province in the winter of 2015. On March 25, 2015, Whalen said \"every recommendation in the Broten review is [being] looked at\", including a carbon tax, but only explicitly ruled out increasing the HST on books and eliminating a volunteer firefighter tax credit.\\n\\nOn January 14, 2015, Broten was selected by the Nova Scotia Business Incorporated (NSBI) board to the position of President and CEO of NSBI.

Employers generally have to pay workers the highest minimum wage prescribed by federal, state, and local law. Since July 24, 2009, the federal government has mandated a nationwide minimum wage of $7.25 per hour. there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2017 to 2018, eight states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in eleven other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.\\n\\nUsing 2018 inflation-adjusted dollars, the federal minimum wage peaked at $11.79 per hour in 1968. If the minimum wage in 1968 had kept up with labor\\'s productivity growth, it would have reached $19.33 in 2017. There is a racial difference in support for a higher minimum wage with most Black and Latino individuals supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of Whites opposing it. about 2% of White, Asian, and Latino workers earned the federal minimum wage or less. Amongst Black workers, the percentage was about 3%.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nMinimum wage legislation emerged at the end of the nineteenth century from the desire to end sweated labor which had developed in the wake of industrialization. Sweatshops employed large numbers of women and young workers, paying them what were considered nonliving wages that did not allow workers to afford the necessaries of life. Besides substandard wages, sweating was also associated with long work hours and unsanitary work conditions. From the 1890s to the 1920s, during the Progressive Era, a time of social activists and political reform across the United States, progressive reformers, women\\'s organizations, religious figures, academics, and politicians all played an important role in getting state minimum wage laws passed throughout the United States.\\n\\nThe first successful attempts at using minimum wage laws to ameliorate the problem of nonliving wages occurred in the Australian state of Victoria in 1896. Factory inspector reports and newspaper reporting on the conditions of sweated labor in Melbourne, Victoria led in 1895 to the formation of the National Anti-Sweating League which pushed the government aggressively to deal legislatively with the problem of substandard wages. The government, following the recommendation of the Victorian Chief Secretary Alexander Peacock, established wage boards which were tasked with establishing minimum wages in the labor trades which suffered from nonlivable wages. During the same time period, campaigns against sweated labor were occurring in the United States and England.\\n\\nSection::::Progressive Era.\\nAs in Australia, civic concern for sweated labor developed in the United States towards the end of the Gilded Age. In New York state in 1890, a group of female reformers who were worried about the harsh conditions of sweated labor in the country formed the Consumer\\'s League of the City of New York. The consumer group sought to improve working conditions by boycotting products which were made under sweated conditions and did not conform to a code of \"fair house\" standards drawn up by them. Similar, consumer leagues formed throughout the United States, and in 1899, they united under the National Consumer League (NCL) parent organization. Consumer advocacy, however, was extremely slow at changing conditions in the sweated industries. When NCL leaders in 1908 went to an international anti-sweatshop conference in Geneva, Switzerland and were introduced to Australian minimum wage legislation, which had successfully dealt with sweated labor, they came home believers and made minimum wage legislation part of their national platform.\\nIn 1910, in conjunction with advocacy work led by Florence Kelley of the National Consumer League, the Women\\'s Trade Union League (WTLU) of Massachusetts under the leadership of Elizabeth Evans took up the cause of minimum wage legislation in Massachusetts. Over the next two years, a coalition of social reform groups and labor advocates in Boston pushed for minimum wage legislation in the state. On June 4, 1912, Massachusetts passed the first minimum wage legislation in the United States, which established a state commission for recommending non-compulsory minimum wages for women and children. The passage of the bill was significantly assisted by the Lawrence textile strike which had raged for ten weeks at the beginning of 1912. The strike brought national attention to the plight of the low wage textile workers, and pushed the state legislatures, who feared the magnitude of the strike, to enact progressive labor legislation.\\n\\nBy 1923, fifteen U.S. states and the District of Columbia had passed minimum wage laws, with pressure being placed on state legislatures by the National Consumers League in a coalition with other women\\'s voluntary associations and organized labor. The United States Supreme Court of the \"Lochner\" era (1897–1937), however, consistently invalidated labor regulation laws. Advocates for state minimum wage laws hoped that they would be upheld under the precedent of \"Muller v. Oregon\" (1908), which upheld maximum working hours laws for women on the grounds that women required special protection that men did not. The Supreme Court, however, did not extend this principle to minimum wage laws. The court ruled in \"Adkins v. Children\\'s Hospital\" (1923) that the District of Columbia\\'s minimum wage law was unconstitutional, because the law interfered with the ability of employers to freely negotiate wage contracts with employees. The court also noted that women did not require anymore special protection by the law, following the passage in 1920 of the Nineteenth Amendment, which gave women the right to vote and equal legal status.\\n\\nSection::::New Deal.\\nIn 1933, the Roosevelt administration during the New Deal made the first attempt at establishing a national minimum wage regiment with the National Industrial Recovery Act, which set minimum wage and maximum hours on an industry and regional basis. The Supreme Court, however, in \"Schechter Poultry Corp. v. United States\" (1935) ruled the act unconstitutional, and the minimum wage regulations were abolished. Two years later after President Roosevelt\\'s overwhelming reelection in 1936 and discussion of judicial reform, the Supreme Court took up the issue of labor legislation again in \"West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish\" (1937) and upheld the constitutionality of minimum wage legislation enacted by Washington state and overturned the \"Adkins\" decision which marked the end of the \"Lochner\" era. In 1938, the minimum wage was re-established pursuant to the Fair Labor Standards Act, this time at a uniform rate of $0.25 per hour (). The Supreme Court upheld the Fair Labor Standards Act in \"United States v. Darby Lumber Co.\" (1941), holding that Congress had the power under the Commerce Clause to regulate employment conditions.\\n\\nThe 1938 minimum wage law only applied to \"employees engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce,\" but in amendments in 1961 and 1966, the federal minimum wage was extended (with slightly different rates) to employees in large retail and service enterprises, local transportation and construction, state and local government employees, as well as other smaller expansions; a grandfather clause in 1990 drew most employees into the purview of federal minimum wage policy, which now set the wage at $3.80.\\n\\nSection::::Legislation.\\nThe federal minimum wage in the United States was reset to its current rate of $7.25 per hour in July 2009. Some U.S. territories (such as American Samoa) are exempt. Some types of labor are also exempt: Employers may pay tipped labor a minimum of $2.13 per hour, as long as the hour wage plus tip income equals at least the minimum wage. Persons under the age of 20 may be paid $4.25 an hour for the first 90 calendar days of employment (sometimes known as a youth, teen, or training wage) unless a higher state minimum exists. The 2009 increase was the last of three steps of the Fair Minimum Wage Act of 2007, which was signed into law as a rider to the U.S. Troop Readiness, Veterans\\' Care, Katrina Recovery, and Iraq Accountability Appropriations Act, 2007, a bill that also contained almost $5 billion in tax cuts for small businesses.\\n\\nSection::::Inflation indexing.\\nSome politicians in the United States advocate linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index, thereby increasing the wage automatically each year based on increases to the consumer price index. Linking the minimum wage to the consumer price index avoids the erosion of the purchasing power of the minimum wage with time because of inflation. In 1998 Washington state became the first state to approve consumer price indexing for its minimum wage. In 2003 San Francisco, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico were the first cities to approve consumer price indexing for their minimum wage. Oregon and Florida were the next states to link their minimum wages to the consumer price index. Later in 2006, voters in six states (Arizona, Colorado, Missouri, Montana, Nevada, and Ohio) approved statewide increases in the state minimum wage. The amounts of these increases ranged from $1 to $1.70 per hour, and all increases were designed to annually index to inflation. As of 2018, the minimum wage is indexed to inflation in 17 states.\\n\\nSection::::Living wage protests.\\nSince 2012, a growing protest and advocacy movement called \"Fight for $15\", initially growing out of fast food worker strikes, has advocated for an increase in the minimum wage to a living wage. Since the start of these protests, a number of states and cities have increased their minimum wage. In 2014 Connecticut for instance passed legislation to raise the minimum wage from $8.70 to $10.10 per hour by 2017, making it one of about six states at the time to aim at or above $10.00 per hour. In 2014 and 2015, several cities, including San Francisco, Seattle, Los Angeles, and Washington D.C. passed ordinances that gradually increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour. In 2016 New York and California became the first states to pass legislation that would gradually raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour in each state, followed by Massachusetts in 2018.\\n\\nIn April 2014, the U.S. Senate debated the minimum wage on the federal level by way of the Minimum Wage Fairness Act. The bill would have amended the Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA) to increase the federal minimum wage for employees to $10.10 per hour over the course of a two-year period. The bill was strongly supported by President Barack Obama and many of the Democratic Senators, but strongly opposed by Republicans in the Senate and House. Later in 2014, voters in the Republican-controlled states of Alaska, Arkansas, Nebraska and South Dakota considered ballot initiatives to raise the minimum wage above the national rate of $7.25 per hour, which were successful in all four states. The results provided evidence that raising minimum wage has support across party lines.\\n\\nIn April 2017, Senator Bernie Sanders and Senator Patty Murray, backed by 28 of the Senate\\'s Democrats, introduced new federal legislation which would raise the minimum wage to $15 per hour by 2024 and index it to inflation. The Raise the Wage Act of 2017, which was simultaneously introduced in the House of Representatives with 166 Democratic cosponsors, would raise the minimum wage to $9.25 per hour immediately, and then gradually increase it to $15 per hour by 2024, while simultaneously raising the minimum wage for tipped workers and phasing it out. The legislation was introduced according to Senator Bernie Sanders to make sure that every worker has at least a modest and decent standard of living.\\n\\nSection::::State laws.\\nIn the United States, different states are able to set their own minimum wages independent of the federal government. When the state and federal minimum wage differ the higher wage prevails. there were 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. Washington has the highest state minimum wage at $11.50 per hour. A number of states have also in recent years enacted state preemption laws, which restrict local community rights, and bar local governments from setting their own minimum wage amounts. state preemption laws for local minimum wages have passed in 25 states.\\n\\nLegislation has passed recently in multiple states that significantly raises the minimum wage. California and Illinois are both set to raise their minimum wage to $15.00 per hour by January 1, 2023 and 2025 respectively. Colorado is set to raise its minimum wage from $9.30 per hour to $12 per hour by January 1, 2020, rising $0.90 per year. New York has also passed legislation to increase its minimum wage to $15.00 per hour over time, certain counties and larger companies are set on faster schedules than others. A number of other cities and states across the country are also debating and enacting legislation to increase the minimum wage for low wage workers to a livable wage.\\n\\nSection::::Local ordinances.\\nSome government entities, such as counties and cities, observe minimum wages that are higher than the state as a whole. In 2003 San Francisco, California and Santa Fe, New Mexico were the first two cities to introduce local minimum wage ordinances. Another device to increase wages locally are living wage ordinances, which generally apply only to businesses that are under contract to the local government itself. In 1994 Baltimore, Maryland was the first city in the United States to pass such a living wage ordinance. These targeted living wage ordinances for city contract workers have led in subsequent years to citywide local minimum wage laws which apply to all workers.\\n\\nIn the current wave of minimum wage legislative action, Seattle, Washington was the first city to pass on June 2, 2014 a local ordinance to increase the minimum wage for all workers to $15.00 per hour, which phases in over seven years. This ordinance followed the referendum in SeaTac, Washington in November 2013, which raised on a more limited scale the local minimum wage to $15.00 for transportation and hospitality workers. Numerous other cities have followed Seattle\\'s example since. San Francisco became the first major city in the U.S. to reach a minimum wage of $15.00 per hour on July 1, 2018. New York City\\'s minimum wage will be $15.00 per hour by the end of 2018. The minimum wage in Los Angeles and Washington, D.C., will be $15.00 per hour in 2020. Similarly, the minimum wage in Minneapolis, Minnesota will be $15.00 per hour by 2022. A growing number of other California cities have also enacted local minimum wage ordinances to increase the minimum wage to $15.00 per hour, including Berkeley, El Cerrito, Emeryville, Mountain View, Oakland, Richmond, and San Jose.\\n\\nSection::::Union exemptions.\\nSome minimum wage ordinances have an exemption for unionized workers. For instance, the Los Angeles City Council approved a minimum salary in 2014 for hotel workers of $15.37 per hour which has such an exemption. This led in some cases to longtime workers at unionized hotels such as the Sheraton Universal making $10.00 per hour, whereas non-union employees at a non-union Hilton less than 500 feet away making at least $15.37 as mandated by law for non-unionized employees. Similar exemptions have been adopted in other cities. As of December 2014, unions were exempt from minimum wage ordinances in Chicago, Illinois, SeaTac, Washington, and Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, as well as the California cities of Los Angeles, San Francisco, Long Beach, San Jose, Richmond, and Oakland. In 2016, the District of Columbia Council passed a minimum wage ordinance that included a union waiver, but Mayor Vincent Gray vetoed it. Later that year, the council approved an increase without the union waiver.\\n\\nSection::::Historical trend.\\nThe federal minimum wage was introduced in 1938 at the rate of $0.25 per hour (). By 1950 the minimum wage had risen to $0.75 per hour. The minimum wage had its highest purchasing power in 1968, when it was $1.60 per hour (). The real value of the Federal minimum wage in 2016 dollars has decreased by one-third since 1968. The minimum wage would be $11 in 2016 if its real value had remained at the 1968 level. From January 1981 to April 1990, the minimum wage was frozen at $3.35 per hour, then a record-setting minimum wage freeze. From September 1, 1997 through July 23, 2007, the federal minimum wage remained constant at $5.15 per hour, breaking the old record. In 2009 the minimum wage was adjusted to $7.25 where it has remained fixed for the past nine years.\\n\\nThe purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has fluctuated. Since 1984, the purchasing power of the federal minimum wage has decreased. Measured in real terms (adjusted for inflation) using 1984 dollars, the real minimum wage was $3.35 in 1984, $2.33 in 1994, $1.84 in 2004, and $1.46 in 2014. If the minimum wage had been raised to $10.10 in 2014, that would have equated to $4.40 in 1984 dollars. This would have been equal to a 31% increase in purchasing power, despite the nominal value of the minimum wage increasing by 216% in the same time period.\\n\\nSection::::Economic effects.\\nThe economic effects of raising the minimum wage are unclear. Adjusting the minimum wage may affect current and future levels of employment, prices of goods and services, economic growth, income inequality, and poverty. The interconnection of price levels, central bank policy, wage agreements, and total aggregate demand creates a situation in which conclusions drawn from macroeconomic analysis are highly influenced by the underlying assumptions of the interpreter.\\n\\nSection::::Employment.\\nIn neoclassical economics, the law of demand states that—all else being equal—raising the price of any particular good or service reduces the quantity demanded. Therefore, neoclassical economists argue that—all else being equal—raising the minimum wage will have adverse effects on employment. Conceptually, if an employer does not believe a worker generates value equal to or in excess of the minimum wage, they do not hire or retain that worker.\\n\\nOther economists of different schools of thought argue that a limited increase in the minimum wage does not affect or increases the number of jobs available. Economist David Cooper for instance estimates that a higher minimum wage would support the creation of at least 85,000 new jobs in the United States. This divergence of thought began with empirical work on fast food workers in the 1990s which challenged the neoclassical model. In 1994, economists David Card and Alan Krueger studied employment trends among 410 restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania following New Jersey\\'s minimum wage hike (from $4.25 to $5.05) in April 1992. They found \"no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.\" In contrast, a 1995 analysis of the evidence by David Neumark found that the increase in New Jersey\\'s minimum wage resulted in a 4.6% decrease in employment. Neumark\\'s study relied on payroll records from a sample of large fast-food restaurant chains, whereas the Card-Krueger study relied on business surveys.\\nA literature review conducted by David Neumark and William Wascher in 2007 (which surveyed 101 studies related to the employment effects of minimum wages) found that about two-thirds of peer-reviewed economic research showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment—especially for young and unskilled workers. Neumark\\'s review further found that, when looking at only the most credible research, 85% of studies showed a positive correlation between minimum wage hikes and increased unemployment.\\n\\nStatistical meta-analysis conducted by Tom Stanley in 2005 in contrast found that there is evidence of publication bias in minimum wage literature, and that correction of this bias shows no relationship between the minimum wage and unemployment. In 2008 Hristos Doucouliagos and Tom Stanley conducted a similar meta-analysis of 64 U.S. studies on disemployment effects and concluded that Card and Krueger\\'s initial claim of publication bias was correct. Moreover, they concluded, \"Once this publication selection is corrected, little or no evidence of a negative association between minimum wages and employment remains.\"\\nThe Congressional Budget Office (CBO) in 2014 estimated the theoretical effects of a federal minimum wage increase under two scenarios: an increase to $9.00 and an increase to $10.10. According to the report, approximately 100,000 jobs would be lost under the $9.00 option, whereas 500,000 jobs would be lost under the $10.10 option (with a wide range of possible outcomes). The Center for Economic and Policy Research (CEPR) in contrast in 2013 found in a review of multiple studies since 2000 that there was \"little or no employment response to modest increases in the minimum wage.\" CEPR found in a later study that job creation within the United States is faster within states that raised their minimum wage. In 2014 the state with the highest minimum wage in the nation, Washington, exceeded the national average for job growth in the United States. Washington had a job growth rate 0.3% faster than the national average job growth rate.\\n\\nA 2012 study led by Joseph Sabia estimated that the 2004-6 New York State minimum wage increase (from $5.15 to $6.75) resulted in a 20.2% to 21.8% reduction in employment for less-skilled, less-educated workers. Similarly, a study led by Richard Burkhauser in 2000 concluded that minimum wage increases \"significantly reduce the employment of the most vulnerable groups in the working-age population—young adults without a high school degree (aged 20-24), young black adults and teenagers (aged 16-24), and teenagers (aged 16-19).\"\\n\\n\"The Economist\" wrote in December 2013 in sum that: \"A minimum wage, providing it is not set too high, could thus boost pay with no ill effects on jobs...Some studies find no harm to employment from federal or state minimum wages, others see a small one, but none finds any serious damage...High minimum wages, however, particularly in rigid labour markets, do appear to hit employment. France has the rich world\\'s highest wage floor, at more than 60% of the median for adults and a far bigger fraction of the typical wage for the young. This helps explain why France also has shockingly high rates of youth unemployment: 26% for 15- to 24-year-olds.\"\\n\\nIn 2018, a study from the University of Washington found that increasing the minimum wage in Seattle resulted in minimum wage earners making $125 less each month due to employers\\'s cutting hours.\\n\\nSection::::Prices.\\nConceptually, raising the minimum wage increases the cost of labor, ceteris paribus. Thus, employers may accept lower profits, raise their prices, or both. If prices increase, consumers may demand a lesser quantity of the product, substitute other products, or switch to imported products, due to the effects of price elasticity of demand. Marginal producers (those who are barely profitable enough to survive) may be forced out of business if they cannot raise their prices sufficiently to offset the higher cost of labor. Federal Reserve Bank of Chicago research from 2007 has shown that restaurant prices rise in response to minimum wage increases. However, there are studies that show that higher prices for products due to increased labor cost are usually only by about 0.4% of the original price.\\n\\nSection::::Effects on crime.\\nA 2016 White House report based on \"back of envelope calculations and literature review\" argued that higher hourly wages led to less crime. The study by the Council of Economic Advisers calculated that \"raising the minimum wage reduces crime by 3 to 5 percent.\" To get those numbers, the study assumed that \"such a minimum wage increase would have no employment impacts, with an employment elasticity of 0.1 the benefits would be somewhat lower.\"\\n\\nIn contrast in a 1987 journal article, Masanori Hashimoto noted that minimum wage hikes lead to increased levels of property crime in areas affected by the minimum wage after its increase. According to the article, by decreasing employment in poor communities, total legal trade and production are curtailed. The report also argued that to compensate for the decrease in legal avenues for production and consumption, poor communities increasingly turn to illegal trade and activity.\\n\\nSection::::Economic growth.\\nWhether growth (GDP, a measure of both income and production) increases or decreases depends significantly on whether the income shifted from owners to workers results in an overall higher level of spending. The tendency of a consumer to spend their next dollar is referred to as the marginal propensity to consume or MPC. The transfer of income from higher income owners (who tend to save more, meaning a lower MPC) to lower income workers (who tend to save less, with a higher MPC) can actually lead to an increase in total consumption and higher demand for goods, leading to increased employment. Recent research has shown that higher wages lead to greater productivity.\\n\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that income (GDP) overall would be marginally higher after raising the minimum wage, indicating a small net positive increase in growth. Raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and indexing it to inflation would result in a net $2 billion increase in income during the second half of 2016, while raising it to $9.00 and not indexing it would result in a net $1 billion increase in income.\\n\\nSection::::Income inequality.\\nAn increase in the minimum wage is a form of redistribution from higher-income persons (business owners or \"capital\") to lower income persons (workers or \"labor\") and therefore should reduce income inequality. The CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage under either scenario described above would improve income inequality. Families with income more than 6 times the poverty threshold would see their incomes fall (due in part to their business profits declining with higher employee costs), while families with incomes below that threshold would rise.\\n\\nSection::::Poverty.\\nAmong hourly-paid workers In 2016, 701,000 earned the federal minimum wage and about 1.5 million earned wages below the minimum.Together, these 2.2 million workers represented 2.7% of all hourly-paid workers.\\n\\nThe CBO estimated in February 2014 that raising the minimum wage would reduce the number of persons below the poverty income threshold by 900,000 under the $10.10 option versus 300,000 under the $9.00 option. Similarly, Arindrajit Dube, professor of economics at University of Massachusetts Amherst, found in a 2017 study \"robust evidence that higher minimum wages lead to increases in incomes among families at the bottom of the income distribution and that these wages reduce the poverty rate.\" According to the study \"a 10 percent increase in the minimum wage reduces the nonelderly poverty rate by about 5 percent.\"\\n\\nIn contrast, research conducted by David Neumark and colleagues in 2004 found that minimum wages are associated with reductions in the hours and employment of low-wage workers. A separate study by the same researchers found that minimum wages tend to increase the proportion of families with incomes below or near the poverty line. Similarly, a 2002 study led by Richard Vedder, professor of economics at Ohio University, concluded that \"The empirical evidence is strong that minimum wages have had little or no effect on poverty in the U.S. Indeed, the evidence is stronger that minimum wages occasionally increase poverty…\"\\n\\nAccording to a large majority of economists, minimum wage increases result in a variety of negative effects for lower-skilled workers including reduced employment, reduced hours, reduced benefits, and less safe working conditions.\\n\\nSection::::Federal budget deficit.\\nThe CBO reported in February 2014 that \"[T]he net effect on the federal budget of raising the minimum wage would probably be a small decrease in budget deficits for several years but a small increase in budget deficits thereafter. It is unclear whether the effect for the coming decade as a whole would be a small increase or a small decrease in budget deficits.\" On the cost side, the report cited higher wages paid by the government to some of its employees along with higher costs for certain procured goods and services. This might be offset by fewer government benefits paid, as some workers with higher incomes would receive fewer government transfer payments. On the revenue side, some would pay higher taxes and others less.\\n\\nSection::::Commentary.\\nSection::::Economists.\\nAccording to a survey conducted by economist Greg Mankiw, 79% of economists agreed that \"a minimum wage increases unemployment among young and unskilled workers.\"\\n\\nA 2015 survey conducted by the University of New Hampshire Survey Center found that a majority of economists believes raising the minimum wage to $15 per hour would have negative effects on youth employment levels (83%), adult employment levels (52%), and the number of jobs available (76%). Additionally, 67% of economists surveyed believed that a $15 minimum wage would make it harder for small businesses with less than 50 employees to stay in business.\\n\\nA 2006 survey conducted by economist Robert Whaples of a sample of 210 Ph.D. economists randomly selected from the American Economic Association, found that, regarding the U.S. minimum wage:\\n\\nIn 2014, over 600 economists signed a letter in support of increasing the minimum wage to $10.10 with research suggesting that a minimum wage increase could have a small stimulative effect on the economy as low-wage workers spend their additional earnings, raising demand and job growth. Also, seven recipients of the Nobel Prize in Economic Sciences were among 75 economists endorsing an increase in the minimum wage for U.S. workers and said \"the weight\" of economic research shows higher pay doesn\\'t lead to fewer jobs.\\n\\nAccording to a February 2013 survey of the University of Chicago IGM Forum, which includes approximately 40 economists:\\n\\nAccording to a fall 2000 survey conducted by Fuller and Geide-Stevenson, 73.5% (27.9% of which agreed with provisos) of American economists surveyed agreed that minimum wage laws increase unemployment among unskilled and young workers, while 26.5% disagreed with the statement.\\n\\nEconomist Paul Krugman advocated raising the minimum wage moderately in 2013, citing several reasons, including:\\n\\nSection::::Major political parties.\\nDemocratic candidates, elected officials, and activists support an increase in the minimum wage. In his 2013 State of the Union Address, President Barack Obama called for an increase in the federal minimum wage to $9 an hour; several months later, Democrats Tom Harkin and George Miller proposed legislation to increase the federal minimum wage to $10.10; and in 2015, congressional Democrats introduced a proposal to increase the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour. These efforts did not succeed, but increases in city and state minimum wages prompted congressional Democrats to continue fighting for an increase on the federal level. After much internal party debate, the party\\'s official platform adopted at the 2016 Democratic National Convention stated: \"We should raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour over time and index it, give all Americans the ability to join a union regardless of where they work, and create new ways for workers to have power in the economy so every worker can earn at least $15 an hour.\"\\n\\nMost Republican elected officials oppose action to increase the minimum wage, and have blocked Democratic efforts to increase the minimum wage. Republican leadership such as Speakers of the House John Boehner and Paul Ryan have opposed minimum wage increases. Some Republicans oppose having a minimum wage altogether, while a few, conversely, have supported minimum wage increases or indexing the minimum wage to inflation.\\n\\nSection::::Polls.\\nThe Pew Center reported in January 2014 that 73% of Americans supported raising the minimum wage from $7.25 to $10. By party, 53% of Republicans and 90% of Democrats favored this action. Pew found a racial difference for support of a higher minimum wage in 2017 with most blacks and Hispanics supporting a $15.00 federal minimum wage, and 54% of whites opposing it.\\n\\nA Lake Research Partners poll in February 2012 found the following:\\n\\nSection::::List by jurisdiction.\\nThis is a list of the minimum wages (per hour) in each state and territory of the United States, for jobs covered by federal minimum wage laws. If the job is not subject to the federal Fair Labor Standards Act, then state, city, or other local laws may determine the minimum wage. A common exemption to the federal minimum wage is a company having revenue of less than $500,000 per year while not engaging in any interstate commerce.\\n\\nUnder the federal law, workers who receive a portion of their salary from tips, such as waitstaff, are required only to have their total compensation, including tips, meet the minimum wage. Therefore, often, their hourly wage, before tips, is less than the minimum wage. Seven states, and Guam, do not allow for a tip credit. Additional exemptions to the minimum wage include many seasonal employees, student employees, and certain disabled employees as specified by the FLSA.\\n\\nIn addition, some counties and cities within states may implement a higher minimum wage than the rest of their state. Sometimes this higher wage applies only to businesses that contract with the local government, while in other cases the higher minimum applies to all work.\\n\\nSection::::State.\\nThe average US minimum wage per capita (2017) is $8.49 based on the population size of each state and generally represents the average minimum wage experienced by a person working in one of the fifty US states. Cities, counties, districts, and territories are not included in the calculation.\\nAs of October 2016, there have been 29 states with a minimum wage higher than the federal minimum. From 2014 to 2015, nine states increased their minimum wage levels through automatic adjustments, while increases in 11 other states occurred through referendum or legislative action.\\nBeginning in January 2017, Massachusetts and Washington state have the highest minimum wages in the country, at $11.00 per hour. New York City\\'s minimum wage for companies with 11 or more employees became $15.00 per hour on December 31, 2018. On the same day, NYC\\'s hourly minimum wage for companies with 10 or fewer employees became $13.50. The minimum wage in Illinois will reach $15 per hour by 2025 with increases beginning in 2020.\\n\\nSection::::Large corporations.\\nSome large employers in the traditionally low-paying retail sector have declared an internal minimum wage.

It is a prostrate shrub with lance-shaped leaves and white, rarely deep mauve flowers.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\n\"Eremophila debilis\" is a prostrate shrub with spreading stems up to long. It has glossy green, elliptic to lance-shaped leaves which are mostly long, wide and glabrous usually with 3 or 4 pairs of prominent teeth on the edges.\\n\\nThe flowers are borne singly or in groups of up to 3 in leaf axils on a stalk long. There are 5 green, lance-shaped, slightly overlapping sepals mostly long. The petals are long and joined at their lower end to form a tube. The petal tube is white to pale mauve and, unlike many others in the genus, does not have spots. The petal tube and lobes are mostly glabrous on the outside but the inside of the tube is filled with soft hairs. The 4 stamens are fully enclosed within the tube. Flowering mainly occurs in spring and summer and is followed by rounded, fleshy, white to reddish purple fruits, which are in diameter.\\n\\nSection::::Taxonomy and naming.\\nThe species was first formally described by Henry Charles Andrews in 1802 who gave it the name \"Pogonia debilis\". The description was published in \"The Botanist\\'s Repository for New, and Rare Plants\". Robert Brown changed the name to \"Myoporum debile\" in 1810 and in 1992 Robert Chinnock changed the name to \"Eremophila debilis\". The specific epithet (\"debilis\") is a Latin word meaning \"weak\" referring to the decumbent stems of this species.\\n\\nSection::::Distribution and habitat.\\n\"Eremophila debilis\" is widespread in eastern Queensland and New South Wales in a wide range of soils and vegetation associations, often in box and white cypress communities, sometimes forming dense mats. It has been recorded near Boosey in Victoria. It is also present in New Zealand, thought to be the result of naturalisation.\\n\\nSection::::Use in horticulture.\\nWinter apple is well known in horticulture, although often as \"Myoporum debile\". It is suitable as a groundcover in many areas as long as the soil is reasonably well-drained. Its flowers, fruit and foliage are attractive features.

Born in Chester County, Pennsylvania of Scottish descent, Steele worked in the Lancaster post-office as a young man, where he once met James Buchanan.\\n\\nSection::::Early success.\\nWith encouragement from his future brother-in-law Henry Hastings Sibley, Steele saw opportunities in the western frontier and traveled to Fort Snelling via the steamboat \"Burlington\", arriving June 18, 1838; he soon became a storekeeper at the fort. At that time, the land on both sides of the Mississippi River at St. Anthony Falls was controlled by the U.S. Government as part of the Fort Snelling Reservation. However, by 1837 over 150 squatters had staked unofficial claims on fort property. In 1838, the fort commander, Joseph Plympton convinced the government to release the east bank of the river for settlement, hoping to stake a personal claim on the valuable land closest to the Falls. But Steele surreptitiously staked the first claim on the choicest land before sunrise on the first day of legal settlement. He claimed a half-mile of east-bank riverfront, controlling half of the water power of St. Anthony Falls; adjacent property was claimed by Pierre Bottineau (1817–1895), a Métis, of French-Canadian, Ojibwe, and Dakota descent.\\n\\nSteele\\'s sister, Abbian, would marry a prominent physician, Thomas R. Potts in 1847. Potts would become the first Mayor of St. Paul.\\n\\nSection::::Lumber mills.\\nEventually, in 1847, Steele secured financing, in the form of $12,000 for a 9/10 stake in the property. On May 18, 1848 president Polk approved the claims made in St. Anthony, and Steele was able to build his dam on the east side of the river above the Falls, blocking the east channel. The dam extended diagonally into the river , was high, and was secured to the limestone riverbed. Its thickness tapered from wide at its base to wide at the top. Steele dispatched logging crews to the Crow Wing River in December 1847 to supply pine for his sawmill, and by September 1, 1848 sawing commenced using two up-down saws. He was able to sell the lumber readily, supplying construction projects in the booming town. The new community at the Falls attracted entrepreneurs from New England, many of whom had experience in lumber and milling. He had hired Ard Godfrey to help build and run the first commercial sawmill at the Falls. Godfrey knew the most efficient ways to use natural resources, like the falls, and the great pine forests, to make lumber products. Godfrey built the first home in St. Anthony, Steele had the town platted in 1849, and it incorporated in 1855.\\n\\nSection::::Foothold on west bank.\\nAlthough St. Anthony was beginning to prosper, the west side of the Mississippi remained firmly under the control of Fort Snelling. Steele knew that whoever could stake their claim on the west bank of St. Anthony Falls would control the second half of the vast source of water power. Late in 1849, Steele convinced his friend John Stevens to negotiate a deal to secure in present-day Minneapolis. In exchange, Stevens would ferry troops across the river to supply the new Fort Ripley. In the summer of 1851 the Treaty of Traverse des Sioux was \"negotiated\" wresting nearly all remaining Minnesotan land from the Indians. In 1852 Congress passed a bill to relinquish of Ft. Snelling, opening the door for the ultimate development of Minneapolis. By 1854, 300 squatters occupied the area, and in 1855 Congress recognized the squatters\\' right to purchase the land they had claimed. The west side quickly developed scores of new mills and consortia. They built a dam diagonally into the river to the north, which, along with Steele\\'s dam created the inverted V-shape, still apparent today. Steele created the St. Anthony Falls Water Power Company in 1856 with three New York financiers. The company struggled for several years, due to poor relations with the financiers, a depression, and the Civil War. In 1868 the firm reorganized with new officers including John Pillsbury, Richard and Samuel Chute, Sumner Farnham, and Frederick Butterfield.\\n\\nSection::::First Mississippi River bridge.\\nThe two communities of Minneapolis and St. Anthony shared the resources of the Falls. Both towns grew quickly and developed a number of industries at the falls. The earliest waterpowered facilities were sawmills; flour mills soon followed. For many years river crossing between the communities was via a rope-drawn ferry, by foot when the river surface was frozen, or on floating log booms that often filled the channel.\\n\\nAlthough he ran one such ferry, as early as 1852, Steele anticipated a need for a permanent bridge to span the river near present-day Hennepin Avenue. He formed the Mississippi Bridge Company to build a -long, wide suspension bridge, linking Minneapolis to Nicollet Island and hired Thomas Griffith to design it. The bridge was opened on 23 January 1855 with a large celebration. As a private enterprise, tolls were levied: five cents per pedestrian, twenty-five cents per horse-drawn wagon, and two cents for swine and sheep.\\n\\nSteele had previously (in 1853) built a shorter bridge to cross the channel from Nicollet Island to St. Anthony; together these created the first permanent bridge to span the Mississippi at any point along its length. They linked the two cities, which legally merged in 1872, taking the name Minneapolis: a compound of the Dakota Indian word, \"minne\" or \"mni\" for \"water\", and the Greek \"polis\" for city.\\n\\nSection::::Purchase of Fort Snelling.\\nBy 1858, Franklin Steele bought the fort and surrounding for $90,000, as the government no longer needed a frontier outpost at that location. But during the Civil War, he leased it back to the government for use as an induction station. After the war was over Steele leased the land to settlers and the city began to grow. The town of Minneapolis became a city in 1867. He ultimately became prosperous from lumber, the suspension bridge, and land deals.\\n\\nSection::::The University of Minnesota.\\nIn 1851 the territorial legislature of Minnesota decided to create a university and four acres (near present-day Central and University Avenues) in St. Anthony was donated by Franklin Steele.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Franklin Steele', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11490867'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1149303', 'text': 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\\n\\nIlsa, She Wolf of the SS is a 1975 Canadian Nazisploitation/sexploitation film directed by Don Edmonds, produced by David F. Friedman and written by Jonah Royston.\\n\\nSection::::Plot.\\nIlsa is Kommandant of a Nazi prison camp, who conducts sadistic scientific experiments designed to demonstrate that women are more capable of enduring pain than men are, and therefore should be allowed to fight in the German armed forces (it is late in the war and the Nazi military is in dire need of reinforcements). Ilsa is also portrayed as a buxom woman with a voracious sexual appetite for men. Every night, she chooses another of her male prisoners and rapes him. However, owing to her hypersexuality, she is disappointed when her current victim eventually ejaculates, and promptly has him castrated and put to death. Only one American prisoner, who can avoid ejaculating, manages to use her weakness to his favor. He hopes that the Allies will arrive soon, but a faction of the SS wants to eliminate all evidence and witnesses.\\n\\n\\nSection::::Production.\\nWhen Lee Frost and David F. Friedman\\'s 1969 \"Love Camp 7\" became popular in Canada, André Link and Cinepix\\'s John Dunning created a script for \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\". After offering to produce, Friedman agreed and brought in Dyanne Thorne to play the eponymous character. Friedman is credited onscreen as \"Herman Traeger\".\\n\\nIlsa is patterned after real-life murderous female Nazi camp personnel Ilse Koch and Irma Grese.\\n\\nFriedman (under the pseudonym Herman Traeger) put a notice before the film opens: \"The film you are about to see is based on documented fact. The atrocities shown were conducted as \\'medical experiments\\' in special concentration camps throughout Hitler\\'s Third Reich. Although these crimes against humanity are historically accurate, the characters depicted are composites of notorious Nazi personalities; and the events portrayed, have been condensed into one locality for dramatic purposes. Because of its shocking subject matter, this film is restricted to adult audiences only. We dedicate this film with the hope that these heinous crimes will never happen again.\"\\n\\nSection::::Location.\\nThe film was made on the Culver City set of the TV series \"Hogan\\'s Heroes\". The series had already been cancelled and the show\\'s producers let the film be made on it once they learned that a scene called for it to be burned down, saving them the cost of having it demolished.\\n\\nSection::::Release.\\n\"Ilsa\" was rejected by the British Board of Film Censors in 1975 and banned in Australia, Germany, and Norway.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\n\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" has received primarily negative reviews, and holds a rating of 36% \"Rotten\" at review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes based on 11 reviews. \"The Independent Film Journal\" wrote, \"Only the most dangerously sadistic mentalities will manage to sit voluntarily through more than ten minutes of \"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS,\" a graphic, stomach-churning catalogue of Nazi medical atrocities that makes \"Texas Chainsaw Massacre\" look like a Sunday picnic ... Theatres catering to the lowest possible grade of audience could make a bundle of dirty money. Others would be wise to forget it.\" Gene Siskel of the \"Chicago Tribune\" gave the film zero stars out of four and called it \"the most degenerate picture I have seen to play downtown ... \\'Ilsa\\' plays like a textbook for rapists and mutilation freaks.\" He identified the distributors of the film and advised them to \"see it, because I\\'m certain they would then remove it.\" Vincent Canby of \"The New York Times\" reported walking out on the film and wrote that it \"could possibly be the worst soft-core sex-and-violence film of the decade—and the funniest. It\\'s set in a World War II Nazi concentration camp built in a meadow that looks very southern California. You can almost hear the freeway traffic on the other side of the hill.\" Dave Kehr of the Chicago Reader described the film as \"self-conscious Canadian-made camp\", which \"wasn\\'t notorious until it was fiercely denounced in the high-profile media\". \"The A.V. Club\" gave the film a scathing review, noting that it \"has absolutely no sense of humor that might go where the obvious lack of moral purpose is\". The film\\'s director Don Edmonds described the screenplay as \"the worst piece of shit I ever read\".\\n\\nSection::::Accolades.\\n\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" won Best Alternative Release at the 1985 AVN awards.\\n\\nSection::::Sequels.\\n\"Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS\" was followed by three sequels, all variations on the sexploitation women in prison theme: \"Ilsa, Harem Keeper of the Oil Sheiks\" in 1976, \"Ilsa, the Wicked Warden\" in 1977, directed by Jesús Franco (the film was also known as \"Greta, The Mad Butcher\", \"Wanda, The Wicked Warden\" and \"Ilsa: Absolute Power\") and–also in 1977–\"Ilsa, the Tigress of Siberia\".\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Ilsa, She Wolf of the SS', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1149303'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'RxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11493963', 'text': 'MAZ-535\\n\\nMAZ-535 is a Soviet/Russian army vehicle, an artillery tractor designed and developed by MAZ in Belarus.

At an early age he accompanied his mother when she moved to New York City, and later to Brooklyn, New York. He enlisted in the Navy February 26, 1892 at age 16 as apprentice, third class. He married Sadie M. Simonson. He was honorably discharged October 25, 1896, with a rank of apprentice, first class. He reenlisted May 3, 1897 as seaman, and rose to the rank of chief yeoman on February 1, 1898.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of Santiago.\\nChief Yeoman Ellis was killed 3 July 1898 while serving on the \"USS Brooklyn\" during the Battle of Santiago de Cuba. During the battle, he was reporting ranges of enemy vessels which he read from the stadimeter, a rangefinding device, while observing from an exposed position, while the \"Brooklyn\" was under fire from as many as four Spanish ships. Yeoman Ellis was considered an expert with the stadimeter. While the Brooklyn was pursuing fleeing Spanish armored cruisers \"Vizcaya\" and \"Cristóbal Colón\", Ellis took a position about three feet in front of the forward turret. He was \"singing out\" the ranges to a messenger, who passed them to the guncrews inside the turrets. He was decapitated when a large shell fired from a Spanish ship struck him in the face. His brain and blood were thrown over a number of people. When an ensign and the ship\\'s doctor started to pick up Ellis\\'s body to throw it over the side, as was a common practice in naval battles, they were stopped by Commodore Schley, who said \"No! Do not throw that body overboard! One who has fought so gallantly deserves the honor of a Christian burial.\"\\n\\nEllis was buried with military honors in Guantanamo, Cuba at Camp McCalla, and later re-buried at Cemetery of the Evergreens in Brooklyn, New York, on November 28, 1898. The funeral at Washington Avenue Baptist Church in Brooklyn had a capacity crowd of 2,000 mourners, with thousands more turned away. Soon after the battle, the officers and men of the Brooklyn took up a collection to benefit Ellis\\'s widow, some contributing over a month\\'s pay, to reach a total of over $1,000.

His brother was Thomas Arundel, Archbishop of Canterbury. His sister was Joan Fitzalan, Countess of Hereford.\\n\\nSection::::High office.\\nJohn was appointed Lord Marshal of England by Richard II of England in 1377, and summoned to the House of Lords on 4 August 1377, by writ directed \"Johanni de Arundell\". He served as Lord Marshal until 1379.\\n\\nOn 26 July 1379 he was given licence to crenellate (i.e., permission to fortify) a stone castle on the site of an 11th-century earthwork fortress in Surrey. Over the years since then the structure was rebuilt and remodelled and its remains are now known as Betchworth Castle.\\n\\nSection::::Naval victory.\\nBeing in command of a naval expedition in aid to the Duke of Brittany, he defeated the French fleet off the coast of Cornwall.\\n\\nSection::::Death at sea.\\nCommanding a force with the purpose of bringing relief to the Duke of Brittany, Sir John was compelled to wait for stronger winds. During this wait he decided to take refuge in a nunnery, where his men \"took no notice of the sanctity of the place and... violently assaulted and raped\" those they found inside. Further to this Sir John \"allowed his men to ransack the countryside as they liked and to impoverish the people\". When the force eventually set out to sea, carrying with them goods stolen from a nearby church and under a pronouncement of excommunication from the wronged priests, the expedition was caught in a storm. Thomas Walsingham reports that during the panic of the storm, Sir John murdered those of his men who refused to make for shore for fear of being shipwrecked upon the rocks. Subsequently, after safely arriving on an island off the Irish coast, Sir John and his boat captain were swept back into the sea and drowned.\\n\\nAccording to Thomas Walsingham\\'s story, FitzAlan\\'s men profaned a convent at or near Southampton, and abducted many of its occupants. The fleet was then pursued by a violent tempest, when the wretched nuns who had been carried off were thrown overboard to lighten the ships. The vessels were, however, wrecked on the Irish coast, near Scariff according to some authorities, but at Cape Clear Island according to others. Sir John Arundell, together with his esquires, and other men of high birth, were drowned, and twenty-five ships were lost with most of their crews. Froissart\\'s account of the event differs essentially from Walsingham\\'s, in the omission of the story of the desecration of the convent.\\n\\nSection::::Burial.\\nHe was buried in Lewes, Sussex.\\n\\nHe was also an ancestor of the poet, Percy Bysshe Shelley.\\n\\nSection::::Marriage and children.\\nOn 17 February 1358, FitzAlan married Eleanor Maltravers (Mautravers) (1345 – 10 January 1404/1406), daughter of John Maltravers and Gwenthin.

In a participant government, citizens who wish to have a say in government can participate in it. Demokratia excluded women, foreigners, and slaves. It barred between 80 and 90 percent of the population from political rights.\\n\\nThe word demokratia comes from δῆμος \"demos\" \"people\" and \"kratos\" \"power\": \"the people hold power.\" \"Demos\", including the lower classes, had political equality and notwhile respecting laws and institutions, was given full and absolute control of power and government.\"\\n\\nIn some languages, including Finnish and Italian, Demokratia is a word simply meaning democracy.\\n\\nQuoted from MODERN AMERICA AND THE RELIGION OF DEMOCRACY (Internet archive) by Loren J Samons II:\\n\\nIn classical Athens, religion suffused every aspect of public life, from the theater to the military to the political assembly. The state (that is, the citizens) sponsored religious festivals and actively participated in the propitiation and worship of the gods. This fact well illustrates the way the various aspects of Athenian society\\xa0— religious, political, economic, and social\\xa0— overlapped with and affected one another, and the way every Athenian found himself set firmly within a matrix of duties to the gods, to his family, and to his fellow citizens. The principle of necessary duties (especially to protect the family, to serve the polis, and to propitiate the gods) formed the basic structure of Athenian society, and gave meaning to each religious, economic, military, and political act. In such an environment, it was impossible for the Athenians abjectly to worship a form of government, demokratia, even after they had made it a goddess. The idea that the \"freedom to make choices\" or \"diversity\" were absolute goods and thus could serve as goals or ideals (on a level with, much less above, family, gods, or polis) contradicted the very premises of Athenian society. Thus while democratic practices ultimately had a marked and deleterious effect on Athenian national strength and public morale and arguably contributed to the loss of Athenian independence, Athenian society managed to stave off the most harmful aspects of democratic theory. Even after they lost their democracy and autonomy, there is little evidence that the Athenians completely lost their fundamental conception of a society based on the principle of duties.\\nSection::::Literature.\\nI.

The word is constructed from the Greek: \"orismos\" (definition) and \"logos\" (word, reasoning, study). \\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe word was coined by William Kirby and William Spence in their \"Introduction to Entomology\" in the early 1800s: \"In the \"terminology\", or what, to avoid the barbarism of a word compounded of Latin and Greek, [Kirby and Spence] would beg to call \"orismology\" of the science, they have endeavoured to introduce throughout a greater degree of precision and concinnity\" in the terms used to talk about insects. This approach to definition is particularly applied to disciplines in natural sciences like Kirby and Spence\\'s entomology that depend upon classificatory schemes, such as taxonomies and ontologies, to organize, name, and address their subject matter. Since the emergence of the discipline of terminology, the use of \"orismology\" has been specialized to definitions and returned to its Greek roots. In the construction of glossaries, that is, specialized dictionaries within a specified domain of discourse, \"orismology\" is generally taken as the complement of \"nomenography\", the study of terms necessary and sufficient for discourse within a specified domain.\\nThe \"Imperial Dictionary\" (1882) reported: \"that branch of natural history which relates to the explanation of the technical terms of the science.\"\\n\\nThe \"Oxford English Dictionary\" (1909) reported: \"A name for the explanation of technical terms, or for such terms collectively; terminology.\"\\n\\nIn Elk\\'s view, \"orismology\" includes etymology and should not be confused with terminology, which focuses on current and immediate interpretations of words. He gives this example: The drug name \"penicillin\" was coined by Alexander Fleming from the Latin for \"paintbrush\", which is \"penicillus\". \"Methicillin\", a type of penicillin, gained its name by attaching the stem \"-cillin\" (from the United States Adopted Names Council\\'s list of stems) to a prefix \"meth\" which has no inherent meaning. The study of penicillin and methicillin individually would be an etymological study of terminology. However, the study of methicillin as its name derived from penicillin historically might best be described, according to Elk, as \"orismologic\". Elk\\'s use of the words \"orismology\" and \"terminology\" echo the historical notions of Kirby and Spence rather than modern disciplinary senses of these words. Orismology does not entail etymology, but nomenography may well delve into etymological analysis to construct such neologisms as are needed to satisfy logical requirements for terms within a domain of discourse. Orismology and nomenography are studies overlapping both terminology and specialized lexicography.\\n', 'title': 'Orismology', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11516814'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11519092', 'text': 'Varászló\\n\\nVarászló is a village in Somogy county, Hungary.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Varászló', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11519092'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'VhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11519170', 'text': 'Have Heart\\n\\nHave Heart is an American straight edge hardcore punk band, formed in New Bedford, Massachusetts in 2002. The band recorded a demo that was released in 2003. In 2004, they released the \"What Counts\" EP (Think Fast! Records), with their debut full-length, \"The Things We Carry\" (Bridge Nine Records) arriving in 2006. Their latest full-length, \"Songs To Scream At The Sun\" (Bridge Nine Records), has garnered much critical acclaim from hardcore critics and fans alike, winning \\'album of the year\\' from many Hardcore-oriented websites. \\n\\nHave Heart\\'s lyrics cover a variety of subjects from the hardcore scene to a much larger scale. Many topics include self-image and its transition to popular media, the straight edge lifestyle, self-control and respect, pacifism, pressure (especially youth pressure), perseverance, self-destruction, friendship, and family. Such lyrical themes have allowed Have Heart to have a commanding force in at least the positive hardcore scene, and even the scene as a whole.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nPart of the resurgent Boston hardcore scene, Have Heart formed in 2002 around the core lineup of singer Patrick Flynn, guitarist Ryan Hudon, and bassist Ryan Briggs. Hailing from the coastal town of New Bedford, the trio moved to Boston after graduating high school. Initially working with a revolving lineup of local musicians, the band played their first show in July 2003, and in November, their debut demo was released. The demo came to the attention of Think Fast! Records, who signed them for the release of the \"What Counts\" EP in 2004. The EP showcased long-time guitarist Ben Kelly and drummer Justin Paling.\\n\\nIn 2005, Have Heart moved to the estimable hardcore indie Bridge Nine Records and underwent a lineup change, with Kelly and Paling replaced by Kei Yasui and Shawn Costa, respectively. The following year they released \"The Things We Carry\", their first full length. In 2007, the band toured through the U.S., Canada and Europe. \\n\\nIn 2008, the band released their second full-length album on Bridge Nine, \"Songs to Scream at the Sun\", which debuted and peaked at No.\\xa0193 on the Billboard top 200 and No.\\xa016 on the Top Heatseekers chart.\\n\\nSection::::2009: Disbandment.\\nOn May 13, 2009, vocalist Patrick Flynn told the world that Have Heart was breaking up after they completed their scheduled world tour, posting a bulletin on the group\\'s Myspace account:\\n\\n\"Once the Fall rolls around, we can\\'t really do this band the way we would prefer to anymore. Knowing this deadline of ours and having a whole world tour already booked, we\\'d like to take advantage of the chance to say goodbye to all the people we have met around the world over the years.\\n\\nSo, please come check us out in the remaining months on our little trip around the globe. So far Asia has been a wonderful experience and we\\'re very happy to have had the chance to meet so many kind people and look forward to the rest of Asia.\\n\\nWe will be playing our last show on this year\\'s National Edge Day on October 17, 2009 with a bunch of our friends bands and a sweet guest. It will be somewhere T accessible in the Boston area. It will also be a benefit for a women\\'s shelter in New Bedford, MA, run by my kind mother.\\n\\nIt\\'s been a nice 7 years and we\\'d like to thank all the unique hardcore kids and bands we have encountered. We have met so many wonderful people who we\\'ll just never forget.\\n\\nIt\\'s been so great. Take care and hope to see you over the next couple months.\"\\n\\nThe bulletin received over 400 comments from fans after it was posted.\\nOn May 13, Have Heart announced that after finishing their world tour and doing a final show on October 17, 2009 for National Edge Day in Massachusetts, they will split. Their final tour with support from Shipwreck covered every major continent. However, due to a family crisis, Flynn was absent during the first week of shows on the European tour. In this time, Sam Yarmuth from Triple B Records filled in for Flynn, and he rejoined the tour on July 3 in Wiesbaden, Germany. On July 25, 2009, Pat Flynn told the audience during their set on Moshvalleyfest in Belgium that they might release a last EP later that year, though this plan was later scratched. A day later on July 26, they played Fluff Fest in Czechia.\\n\\nBridge Nine Records posthumously released a live recording of Have Heart\\'s final show, titled \"10.17.09\", on November 23, 2010. The release features, in one package, the performance on both CD and DVD. Included with \"10.17.09\" was a pamphlet announcing \"We Were Supposed To Stay Young\", an upcoming DVD chronicling the band\\'s career and general scene of the time. Named after lyrics from Minor Threat\\'s \"Betray\", the DVD is set to be released at some point in 2012.\\n\\nHave Heart\\'s final show was played on National Edge Day 2009 in Revere, Massachusetts, along with other straight edge bands. Many members of bands presented testimonies of how members from Have Heart had a huge influence on their lives and careers, along with presenting stories of good times shared with members of Have Heart. Have Heart\\'s last performance consisted of songs from all three of their releases and went for roughly one hour. Fans responded strongly, with some even using boogie boards for stage diving. The last song they played was \"Watch Me Rise\" from \"The Things We Carry\". Afterwards, Flynn laid out on the stage and a good majority of the crowd surrounded him onstage cheering and chanting, \"Have Heart,\" along with fans shouting their personal testimonies to the significance Have Heart had on their lives. This lasted for around 20 minutes straight. Patrick Flynn estimated approximately 1500 people attended, whilst Bridge Nine estimated around 2000.\\n\\nSection::::2010-2014: Post-breakup.\\nFollowing the disbandment of Have Heart, Patrick Flynn began working as a history teacher but he and the other members remained active in their local scenes. Flynn and Costa, along with members of Dropdead, Fucking Invinsible, and Voices Forming Weapons, formed the band Sweet Jesus in 2010. Flynn and Stemper formed the straight edge band Clear and released a demo in 2011. Flynn, Costa and members of Basement formed the group Fiddlehead and released their first demo in 2014.\\n\\nSection::::2015-present: Free and reunion tour.\\nIn 2015, four of the final five members of Have Heart – Patrick Flynn, Kei Yasui, Shawn Costa, and Ryan Hudon – in addition to the band\\'s 2009 touring guitarist, Austin Stemper – formed the band \"Free\". Who released a four-track, self-titled demo recorded by Trevor Vaughan (Sex Positions, Soul Control) in their home of New Bedford, MA on November 29, 2015, followed by another EP titled \"Ex Tenebris\" on May 15, 2017, which also consisted of four songs, recorded by Will Killingsworth at Dead Air Studios. Flynn stated that although they kept the last lineup and same creative process, they changed the band\\'s name in order to not take \"the spotlight\" away from younger hardcore bands.\\n\\nIn February 2019, the line-up of Free announced they would be playing four shows under the name \"Have Heart\" in Leeds, Boston, Los Angeles and Cologne in July 2019. To promote a sale in their webstore and to celebrate the return of Have Heart, Bridge 9 pressed the previously unreleased track from the \"Songs to Scream at the Sun\" sessions titled \"Lions and Lambs\" as a stand-alone limited-edition 7\" single in March 2019. The single was also uploaded to most streaming services.\\n\\nSection::::Acclaim.\\nHave Heart has garnered many favorable reviews for their albums from many sites such as Sputnikmusic and Punknews. \"Songs To Scream At The Sun\" gained a 4.0 (excellent) from Sputnikmusic, and a 4/5 stars from Punknews, and later on was given the No.\\xa011 spot as album of the year for 2008.\\n\\nSection::::Influences.\\nPatrick Flynn has cited numerous influences from their local hardcore scene.

It lies on the north shore of the entrance to the Cromarty Firth.\\n\\nSection::::Nigg Old Church.\\nThe present parish church is an 18th-century building on an early Christian site dating back to at least the 8th century. The Nigg Stone, one of the most elaborate stone monuments of early medieval western Europe, is preserved in a room at the west end of the church. This late 8th century Pictish cross-slab formerly stood in the churchyard, but was moved indoors for preservation in recent years.\\n\\nThe nearby manse is one of the oldest to survive in Scotland, dating back to the first half of the 17th century. It is now privately owned and no longer used as the parish minister\\'s residence.\\n\\nNigg Old has its odd and curious features. In the churchyard is the Cholera Stone, dating from the cholera epidemic of 1832. One of the elders, on coming out of the church, saw a cloud of vapour hovering above the ground. He believed it to be a cloud of cholera, threw a blanket or cloth over it and placed this large stone on top to keep it from escaping. And inside the church, according to one tradition, the beadle (church officer) allowed an illicit still to be kept in the space under the pulpit.\\n\\nSection::::Oil Fabrication Yard.\\nNigg is the site of a crude oil storage and processing depot for oil piped in from the Beatrice oil field in the Moray Firth and of a major multi user energy park including a dry dock operated by Global Energy Group.\\n\\nIn the oil boom of the 1970s the oil fabrication yard at Nigg was extremely busy with many of the skilled workers moving up from areas such as Glasgow. This resulted in what was called as Glasgow colonies in towns such as Invergordon and Alness with many of the families choosing to make the move permanent. This can be seen as even now with some of residents still possessing a Glaswegian accent.\\n\\nSince the purchase of the fabrication yard by Global Energy Group in 2011 and with investment from the Scottish Government the area has begun to see a new influx of workers to the area again with the yard having plenty of work in the renewable energy sector and also in oil drilling rig refurbishment. In 2012 Global Energy Group set up a skills academy to create new jobs for local residents and young people and this has resulted in a fall in unemployment in the area and a welcome boost to the local economy. The extra work at Nigg has also seen an increase in work at the docks in Invergordon.\\n\\nSection::::Ferry service.\\nThe Nigg to Cromarty ferry route is often called \"The King’s Ferry\" – the route taken by King James IV of Scotland when on pilgrimage to the shrine of St Duthac at Tain, doing so at least 18 times in the years between 1493 to 1513.\\n\\nIt is the only ferry service from the Black Isle.

The \"middle chronology\" (reign of Hammurabi 1792–1750 BC) is more commonly accepted in academic literature. For much of the period in question, middle chronology dates can be calculated by adding 64 years to the corresponding short chronology date (e.g. 1728 BC in short chronology corresponds to 1792 in middle chronology).\\n\\nAfter the so-called \"dark age\" between the fall of Babylon and the rise of the Kassite dynasty in Babylonia, absolute dating becomes less uncertain. While exact dates are still not agreed upon, the 64-year middle/short chronology gap ceases from the beginning of the Third Babylon Dynasty onward.\\n\\nSection::::Early Bronze Age.\\nEstimation of absolute dates becomes possible for the second half of the 3rd millennium BC.\\nFor the first half of the 3rd millennium, only very rough chronological matching of archaeological dates with written records is possible.\\n\\nSection::::Kings of Ebla.\\nThe city-states of Ebla and Mari (in modern Syria) competed for power at this time. Eventually, under Irkab-Damu, Ebla defeated Mari for control of the region just in time to face the rise of Uruk and Akkad. After years of back and forth, Ebla was destroyed by the Akkadian Empire. Pottery seals of the Egyptian pharaoh Pepi I have been found in the wreckage of the city.\\n\\nLugal-zage-si of Umma rules from Uruk after defeating Lagash, eventually falling to the emerging Akkadian Empire.\\n\\nSince Akkad (or Agade), the capital of the Akkadian Empire, has not yet been found, available chronological data comes from outlying locations like Ebla, Tell Brak, Nippur, Susa and Tell Leilan. Clearly, the expansion of Akkad came under the rules of Sargon and Naram-sin. Its last king, Shar-kali-sharri barely held the empire together, but upon his death, it fragmented. Finally, the city of Akkad itself was destroyed by the Guti.\\n\\nFirst appearing in the area during the reign of Sargon of Akkad, the Guti became a regional power after the decline of the Akkadian Empire following Shar-kali-sharri. The dynasty ends with the defeat of the last king, Tirigan, by Uruk.\\n\\nSection::::Sumer.\\nOnly a handful of the Guti kings are attested to by inscriptions, aside from the Sumerian king list.\\n\\nFollowing the collapse of the Akkadian Empire after Shar-kali-sharri of Akkad under pressure from the invading Gutians, Lagash gradually regained prominence. As a client state to the Gutian Kings, Lagash was extremely successful, peaking under the rule of Gudea. After the last Gutian king, Tirigan, was defeated, by Utu-hengal, Lagash came under the control of Ur under Ur-Namma. Note that there is some indication that the order of the last two rulers of Lagash should be reversed.\\n\\nUniting various Sumerian city-states, Utu-hengal frees the\\nregion from the Gutians. Note that the Sumerian king list records a preceding 4th Dynasty of Uruk which is as\\nyet unattested.\\n\\nIn an apparently peaceful transition, Ur came to power after the end of the reign of Utu-hengal of Uruk, with the first king, Ur-Namma, solidifying his power with the defeat of Lagash. By the dynasty\\'s end with the destruction of Ur by Elamites and Shimashki, the dynasty included little more than the area around Ur.\\n\\nSection::::Middle Bronze Age.\\nThe Old Assyrian / Old Babylonian period (20th to 15th centuries)\\n\\nAfter Ishbi-Erra of Isin breaks away from the declining Third Dynasty of Ur under Ibbi-Suen, Isin reaches its peak under Ishme-Dagan. Weakened by attacks from the upstart Babylonians, Isin eventually falls to its rival Larsa under Rim-Sin I.\\n\\nThe chronology of the Kingdom of Larsa is based mainly on the Larsa King List (Larsa Dynastic List), the Larsa Date Lists, and a number of royal inscriptions and commercial records. The Larsa King List was compiled in Babylon during the reign of Hammurabi, conqueror of Larsa. It is suspected that the list elevated the first several Amorite Isinite governors of Larsa to kingship so as to legitimize the rule of the Amorite Babylonians over Larsa. After a period of Babylonian occupation, Larsa briefly breaks free in a revolt ended by the death of the last king, Rim-Sin II.\\n\\nFollowing the fall of the Ur III Dynasty, the resultant power vacuum was contested by Isin and Larsa, with Babylon and Assyria later joining the fray. In the second half of the reign of Hammurabi, Babylon became the preeminent power, a position it largely maintained until the sack by Mursili I in 1531 BC. Note that there are no contemporary accounts of the sack of Babylon. It is inferred from much later documents.\\n\\nWhen the names of Sealand Dynasty kings were found on cuneiform records like the Babylonian Kings Lists, Chronicle 20, Chronicle of the Early Kings, and the Synchronistic King List, it was assumed that the dynasty slotted in between the First Dynasty of Babylon and the Kassites. Later discoveries changed this to the assumption that the dynasty ran entirely in parallel to the others. Modern scholarship has made it clear that the Sealand Dynasty did in fact control Babylon and the remnants of its empire for a time after its sack by the Hittites in 1531 BC.\\n\\nThe absolute chronology of the Hittite Old Kingdom hinges entirely on the date of the sack of Babylon. In 1531 BC, for reasons that are still extremely unclear, Mursili I marched roughly 500 miles from Aleppo to Babylon, sacked it, and then promptly returned home, never to return. Other than that event, all the available chronological synchronisms are local to the region in and near Anatolia.\\n\\nSection::::Late Bronze Age.\\nThe Middle Assyrian period (14th to 12th centuries)\\n\\n\\nThe Kassites first appeared during the reign of Samsu-iluna of the First Babylonian Dynasty and after being defeated by Babylon, moved to control the city-state of Mari. Some undetermined amount of time after the fall of Babylon, the Kassites established a new Babylonian dynasty. The Babylonian king list identifies 36 kings reigning 576 years, however, only about 18 names are legible. A few more were identified by inscriptions. There is some confusion in the middle part of the dynasty because of conflicts between the Synchronistic Chronicle and Chronicle P. The later kings are well attested from \"kudurru\" steles. Relative dating is from sychronisms with Egypt, Assyria and the Hittites. The dynasty ends with the defeat of Enlil-nadin-ahi by Elam.\\n\\n\\nPerhaps because the capital of Mitanni, Washukanni, has not yet been found, there are no available king lists, year lists, or royal inscriptions. Fortunately, a fair amount of diplomatic, Hittite, and Assyrian sources exist to firm up the chronology. Having become powerful under Shaushtatar, Mitanni eventually falls into the traditional trap of dynasties, the contest for succession. Tushratta and Artatama II both claim the kingship and the Hittites and Assyrians take advantage of the situation. After that, Mitanni was no longer a factor in the region.\\n\\n\\nLong a minor player, after the defeat of its neighbor Mitanni by the Hittites, Assyria rises to the ranks of a major power under Ashur-uballit I. The period is marked by conflict with rivals Babylon and the Hittites as well as diplomatic exchanges with Egypt, in the Amarna letters. Note that after the excavation, in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, of various Neo-Assyrian documents, such as the Assyrian king list, scholars assumed that the chronological data for earlier Assyrian periods could be taken as accurate history. That view has changed over the years and the early Assyrian chronology is being re-assessed. Since there is yet no consensus, the traditional order and regnal lengths will be followed.\\n\\n\\nBeginning under his father, Suppiluliuma I brought the Hittites from obscurity into an empire that lasts for almost 150 years. The Hittite New Kingdom reaches its height after the defeat of Mitanni, an event which ironically leads to the rise of Assyria. The dynasty ends with the destruction of Hattusa by parties undetermined but which may have included the Sea People and the Kaskians.\\n\\n\\nA client state of Mitanni and later the Hittites, Ugarit was nonetheless a significant player in the region. While regnal lengths and an absolute chronology for Ugarit are not yet available, the known order of kings and some firm synchronisms make it reasonably placeable in time. The fall of Ugarit has been narrowed down to the range from the reign of Pharaoh Merneptah to the 8th year of Pharaoh Rameses III of Egypt. This is roughly the same time that Hattusa is destroyed.\\n\\nSection::::Iron Age.\\nThe Early Iron Age (12th to 7th centuries BC). While not subject to the long versus short dating issue, chronology in the Ancient Near East is not on a firm footing until the rise of the Neo-Babylonian and Neo-Assyrian rulers in their respective regions. The dates, regnal lengths, and even the names of a number of rulers from that interim period are still unknown. To make matters worse, the few surviving records, such as the Synchronistic Chronicle, give conflicting data.\\n\\n\\nAfter the fall of the Kassite dynasty of Babylon to Elam, power\\nin the region, and control of Babylon, swung to the city-state of Isin. Assyria at this time was extremely weak, except during the reign of the powerful Assyrian ruler Tiglath-Pileser I. Other polities in the area had yet to recover from the Bronze Age collapse.\\n\\n\\nAfter the Middle Assyrian Kingdom there is an uncertain period in Assyrian history. The current cornerstone of chronology for this time is the Assyrian King List which, unfortunately, conflicts with other records such as the Synchronised King List and the Babylonian King List. In any event, the rulers of Assyria in this time were all fairly weak, except for Tiglath-Pileser I. Note too that this chronology is based on assumed synchronisms with Egypt in the previous period.\\n\\n\\nDynasties V to IX of Babylon (post-Kassite):\\n\\n\\nThe Assyrian empire rises to become the dominant power in the ancient Near East for over two centuries.

As Japan lacked the industrial capacity to build such warships herself, the vessels were built in Britain. They were part of the \"Six-Six Fleet\" expansion program that began after the defeat of China during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The sister ships participated in three of the four main naval battles of the Russo-Japanese War of 1904–05—the Battle of Port Arthur, the Battle off Ulsan and the Battle of Tsushima—but played a much more minor role in World War I.\\n\\n\"Iwate\" was first used as a training ship in 1916 and remained in that role for most of the rest of her career. Her sister, \"Izumo\", was mostly used for training during the 1920s, but became flagship of the IJN forces in China in 1932. She was involved in the Shanghai Incident that year and in the Second Sino-Japanese War that began five years later. The ship was used in the early stages of the Philippines Campaign during the Pacific War until she struck a mine at the end of 1941. \"Izumo\" joined her sister as a training ship in home waters in 1943. Both ships were sunk in a series of American air attacks on the naval base at Kure in July 1945. Their wrecks were refloated after the war and scrapped.\\n\\nSection::::Background and design.\\nJapan initiated the 1896 Naval Expansion Plan after the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894–95. The plan included four armored cruisers and four battleships, all of which had to be ordered from foreign shipyards as Japan lacked the capability to build them itself. Further consideration of the Russian building program caused the IJN to believe that the battleships ordered under the original plan would not be sufficient to counter the Imperial Russian Navy. Budgetary limitations prevented ordering more battleships and the IJN decided to expand the number of more affordable armored cruisers to be ordered from four to six ships. The revised plan is commonly known as the \"Six-Six Fleet\". These ships were purchased using the £30,000,000 indemnity paid by China after losing the First Sino-Japanese War. Unlike most of their contemporaries, which were designed for commerce raiding or to defend colonies and trade routes, the \"Izumo\" class was intended as fleet scouts and to be employed in the battleline.\\n\\nConstruction of the \"Izumo\"-class ships was awarded to the British shipbuilder Armstrong Whitworth of Elswick, the same shipyard that had built the earlier two armored cruisers of the \"Six-Six Fleet\". They were also designed by Sir Philip Watts, who took advantage of rapidly advancing boiler technology to substitute lighter Belleville boilers in lieu of the cylindrical boilers of the earlier ships and used the weight saved to increase the thickness of the protective deck and improve the hull structure. The increased number of boilers required an extra funnel, which became the primary means of distinguishing between the two classes.\\n\\nSection::::Description.\\nThe \"Izumo\"-class ships were long overall and between perpendiculars. They had a beam of and had an average draft of . The ships displaced at normal load and at deep load. They had metacentric heights of . Their crew consisted of 672 officers and enlisted men.\\n\\nThe ships had two 4-cylinder triple-expansion steam engines, each driving a single propeller shaft. Steam for the engines was provided by 24 Belleville boilers and the engines were rated at a total of . The sisters had a designed speed of and both exceeded it by at least a during their sea trials from . They carried up to of coal and could steam for at a speed of .\\n\\nSection::::Armament.\\nThe main armament for all of the \"Six-Six Fleet\" armored cruisers was four Armstrong Whitworth-built 45-caliber eight-inch guns in twin-gun turrets fore and aft of the superstructure. The electrically operated turrets were capable of 130° rotation left and right, and the guns could be elevated to +30° and depressed to −5°. Each turret accommodated 65 shells, but could only be reloaded through doors in the turret floor and the ship\\'s deck that allowed the electric winch in the turret to hoist shells up from the shell room deep in the hull. The guns were manually loaded and had a rate of fire about 1.2 rounds per minute. The 203-millimeter gun fired armor-piercing (AP) projectiles at a muzzle velocity of to a range of .\\nThe secondary armament consisted of fourteen Elswick Ordnance Company \"Pattern Z\" quick-firing (QF), 40-caliber, guns. All but four of these guns were mounted in armored casemates on the main and upper decks, and their mounts on the upper deck were protected by gun shields. Their AP shells were fired at a muzzle velocity of . The ships were also equipped with a dozen 40-caliber QF 12-pounder 12-cwt guns and eight QF 2.5-pounder Yamauchi guns as close-range defense against torpedo boats. The former gun fired , projectiles at a muzzle velocity of .\\n\\nThe \"Izumo\"-class ships were equipped with four submerged torpedo tubes, two on each broadside. The Type 30 torpedo had a warhead and three range/speed settings: at , at or at .\\n\\nSection::::Protection.\\nAll of the \"Six-Six Fleet\" armored cruisers used the same armor scheme with some minor differences, one of which was that the four later ships all used Krupp cemented armor. The waterline belt ran the full length of the ships and its thickness varied from amidships to at the bow and stern. The thickest part of the belt covered the middle of the ship for a length of . It had a height of , of which was normally underwater. The upper strake of belt armor was thick and extended from the upper edge of the waterline belt to the main deck. It extended from the forward to the rear barbette. The \"Izumo\" class had oblique 5-inch armored bulkhead that closed off the ends of the central armored citadel.\\n\\nThe barbettes, gun turrets and the front of the casemates were all 6 inches thick while the sides and rear of the casemates were protected by of armor. The deck was thick and the armor protecting the conning tower was in thickness. The ships had 30 watertight compartments in their double bottom and an additional 136 or 137 between the bottom and the upper deck.\\n\\nSection::::Service.\\nSection::::Russo-Japanese War.\\nThe sisters spent most of the Russo-Japanese War as flagships together in the 2nd Division of the 2nd Fleet; \"Iwate\" for the divisional commander, Rear Admiral Misu Sotarō, and \"Izumo\" for the fleet commander, Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojō. They participated in the Battle of Port Arthur on 9 February 1904, when Vice Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō led the Combined Fleet in an attack on the Russian ships of the Pacific Squadron anchored just outside Port Arthur. Tōgō had expected the earlier surprise night attack by his destroyers to be much more successful than it was, anticipating that the Russians would be badly disorganized and weakened, but they had recovered from their surprise and were ready for his attack. \"Iwate\" was moderately damaged by the Russians, but \"Izumo\" only slightly.\\nIn April 1904, the division was tasked to contain the Russian armored cruisers based at Vladivostok, but failed to do so until 13 August when the latter tried to rendezvous with the ships that attempted to breakout from Port Arthur. Unbeknownst to the Russians, Tōgō had defeated the ships from Port Arthur during the Battle of the Yellow Sea on 10 August and the Russian squadron from Vladivostok was intercepted off Ulsan, Korea by the 2nd Division. The steering of the Russian cruiser was damaged early in the battle and the Russians made several attempts to prevent the Japanese from concentrating fire on her, but were ultimately forced to abandon her to her fate. Kamimura left \"Rurik\" to the tender ministrations of his reinforcements and pursued the two remaining Russian ships for a time before breaking off pursuit prematurely based on an incorrect report that \"Izumo\" had expended most of her ammunition. That ship was hit over 20 times, but suffered fewer than 20 men killed or wounded. \"Iwate\", in contrast, was hit far fewer times, but one of them started a major ammunition fire that killed or wounded dozens of men. After the battle, the sisters were refitted and assigned to different units, escorting troop convoys to northern Korea, providing cover while a minefield was laid off Vladivostok, and blockading the Tsugaru Strait until the Russian ships from the Baltic Fleet approached Japan in mid-1905.\\n\\nSection::::Battle of Tsushima.\\nThe Russian 2nd and 3rd Pacific Squadrons were spotted on the morning on 27 May 1904 and Tōgō ordered his ships to put to sea. \"Izumo\" and \"Iwate\" had rejoined the 2nd Division in anticipation of this battle and Kamimura\\'s ships confirmed the initial spotting later that morning before joining Tōgō\\'s battleships. Together with most of the Japanese battleships, the division opened fire at 14:10 on the Russian battleship , which was forced to fall out of formation at 14:50 and sank 20 minutes later. After a failed torpedo attack was repulsed by \"Iwate\" and several other cruisers around the same time, the Russian battleship suddenly appeared out of the mist at 15:35 at short range. Kamimura\\'s ships engaged her for five minutes before she disappeared back into the mists. Later in the day, Kamimura led his division in a fruitless pursuit of some of the Russian cruisers around 17:30. He abandoned his chase around 18:03 and encountered the Russian battleline about a half hour later. He stayed at long range and his ships fired when practicable before ceasing fire at 19:30.\\nThe surviving Russian ships were spotted the next morning and the Japanese ships opened fire and stayed beyond the range at which the Russian ships could effectively reply. Rear Admiral Nikolai Nebogatov therefore decided to surrender his ships as he could neither return fire nor close the range. Well after Nebogatov\\'s surrender, the coast defense ship was spotted well south of Nebogatov\\'s ships and \"Iwate\" and the armored cruiser, , were tasked to pursue her. The Japanese ships demanded that the Russians surrender when they came within range, but her captain refused. \"Admiral Ushakov\" attempted to close the range to bring the Japanese cruisers within range of her guns, but they were fast enough to keep the range open and the Russian ship could not hit either of them. After about half an hour, \"Admiral Ushakov\" had been heavily damaged to bear and her commander ordered his crew to abandon ship and the scuttling charges detonated. Both \"Iwate\" and \"Izumo\" were struck several times during the battle, but neither was significantly damaged and casualties were light. After the battle, the division covered amphibious landings in northeastern Korea in July and August before the war ended.\\n\\nSection::::Subsequent service.\\n\"Izumo\" was ordered to patrol the west coast of Mexico to safeguard Japanese interests and nationals during the Mexican Revolution and was still there when Japan declared war on the German Empire on 23 August 1914. She was then tasked to search for German commerce raiders and protect Allied shipping off the western coasts of North and Central America. The ship assisted the armored cruiser in early 1915, when she struck a rock off Baja California. In 1917, \"Izumo\" became the flagship of the Japanese squadron deployed in the Mediterranean Sea. After the war, she sailed to Great Britain to take control of some ex-German submarines and then escorted them part of the way back to Japan.\\n\\n\"Iwate\" played a minor role in the war, participating in the Battle of Tsingtao before sailing to the South Sea Islands to search for German commerce raiders. The ship began the first of her many training cruises for naval cadets of the Imperial Japanese Navy Academy in 1916, a task that would last until the end of 1939. \"Izumo\" began making training voyages of her own during the 1920s.\\nIn 1924, four of the ships\\' 12-pounder guns were removed, as were all of their QF 2.5-pounder guns, and a single 40-caliber 8\\xa0cm/40 3rd Year Type anti-aircraft (AA) gun was added. The gun had a maximum elevation of +75 degrees, and could fire a 3-inch, projectile with a muzzle velocity of to a maximum height of . Refitted again in 1930–31, their torpedo tubes were removed as were all of her main deck 6-inch guns and their casemates plated over; they now carried only four 12-pounders. At that time, \"Iwate\" also had her boilers replaced by six water-tube boilers, but \"Izumo\" was not reboilered until 1935. The new boilers produced less steam which limited engine power to and reduced their top speed to .\\n\\nSection::::China service and World War II.\\nIn 1932, during the First Shanghai Incident, \"Izumo\" became the flagship of the newly re-established 3rd Fleet that garrisoned Japanese-occupied China. Two years later, she was equipped to operate a floatplane at the Sasebo Naval Arsenal. During the Second Sino-Japanese War, the ship participated in the Battle of Shanghai in mid-1937 during which she provided naval gunfire support to Japanese troops ashore.\\n\\nStill in Shanghai at the beginning of the Pacific War on 8 December 1941, \"Izumo\" captured the American river gunboat and assisted in sinking the British river gunboat . On 31 December, the cruiser struck a mine in the Lingayen Gulf while supporting Japanese forces during the Philippines Campaign. During this period, \"Iwate\" was still serving as a training ship in home waters. The sisters were briefly re-classified as 1st-class cruisers on 1 July 1942 before they became training ships in 1943. \"Izumo\" returned to Japan late that year and joined her sister in training naval cadets.\\n\\nIn early 1945, the sisters were rearmed when their 8-inch guns were replaced by four Type 89 dual-purpose guns in two twin mounts and four of their remaining 6-inch guns were removed. When firing at surface targets, the Type 89 gun had a range of ; they had a maximum ceiling of at an elevation of +90 degrees. Their maximum rate of fire was 14 rounds a minute, but their sustained rate of fire was around 8 rounds per minute. Their light anti-aircraft armament was significantly reinforced by the addition of 9 (\"Iwate\") and 14 (\"Izumo\") license-built Hotchkiss 25-millimeter Type 96 light AA guns in single, double and triple mounts and two 13.2-millimeter Hotchkiss machine guns in single mounts. The weapon was the standard Japanese light anti-aircraft gun during World War II, but it suffered from severe design shortcomings that rendered it a largely ineffective weapon. The twin and triple mounts lacked sufficient speed in train or elevation; the gun sights were unable to handle fast targets; the gun exhibited excessive vibration; the magazine was too small and, finally, the gun produced excessive muzzle blast. The weapon had a maximum range of , but effective range was only about .\\n\\nThe sisters were attacked, but not hit, during the American aerial attack on Kure in July 1945. However, the shockwaves from near misses caused extensive flooding in both ships. \"Iwate\" sank in shallow water on 25 July and \"Izumo\" capsized three days later. Both ships were removed from the navy list on 20 November and their wrecks were raised and scrapped in 1946–47.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Izumo-class cruiser', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11540257'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'YhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11542610', 'text': \"Chester W.

It is a combination of ancient Sanskrit theatre with elements of Koothu, a Tamil/Malayalam performing art which is as old as Sangam era. It is officially recognised by UNESCO as a Masterpiece of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity.\\n\\nSection::::Origin.\\nKoothu (കൂത്തു് கூத்து) means dance or performance in Malayalam and Tamil. \\nKoodiyattam (kutiyattam), meaning \"combined acting\" as it combines dramas in Sanskrit theatre with elements of traditional Koothu. It is traditionally performed in temple theatres known as \"Koothambalams\" of Kerala. It is the only surviving artform that uses dramas from ancient Sanskrit theatre. It has an attested history of a thousand years in Kerala, but its origin and evolution are shrouded in mystery. Koodiyattam and chakyar koothu were among the dramatized dance worship services in temples of ancient India, particularly Kerala. Both koodiyattam and chakyar koothu originates from ancient south Indian artform Koothu which is mentioned several times in ancient sangam literature of south and also in the epigraphs belonging to subsequent Pallava, Chera, Chola periods. Inscriptions related to the dramatized dance worship services known as Koothu are available in temples at Tanjore, Tiruvidaimaruthur, Vedaranyam, Tiruvarur, and Omampuliyur. They were treated as an integral part of worship services alongside the singing of tevaram and prabandam hymns. There are mentions in epigraphs those forms of Koothu that are called \"aariyam\" when they use languages other than Tamil such as Sanskrit, Pali or Prakrit for plays.\\n\\nSeveral ancient kings and members of other professions are listed to have authored several works for these services. There is evidence of these services being done all over ancient subcontinent during time of cholas and pallavas. A Pallava king called Rajasimha has been credited with authoring a play called \"kailasodharanam\" in Tamil that has the topic of Ravana becoming subject to Siva\\'s anger and being subdued mercilessly for the same. For examples a fragmented inscription at the door step of an ancient Shiva temple (now non-existent) in Pegan in Burma finds mention of these services.\\n\\nIt is believed that Kulasekhara Varman Cheraman Perumal, an ancient king of Chera dynasty, who ruled from Mahodayapuram (modern Kodungallur), reformed Koodiyattam, introducing the local language for Vidusaka and structuring presentation of the play to well-defined units. He himself wrote two plays, \"Subhadraharana\" and \"Tapatisamvarana\" and made arrangements for their presentation on stage with the help of a Brahmin friend called Tolan. These plays are still presented on stage. Apart from these, the plays traditionally presented include Ascaryacudamani of Saktibhadra, Kalyanasaugandhika of Nilakantha, Bhagavadajjuka of Bodhayana, \"Nagananda of Harsa\", and many plays ascribed to Bhasa including Abhiseka and Pratima. The Kutiyattam performance was performed in specially designed temples called koothambalams.\\n\\nThe use of Buddhist themes for plays is a very controversial and moot issue and seem to be a later interpolation not existing since ancient times for the latter not being a then-legal vedic system.\\n\\nSection::::Instruments used.\\nTraditionally, the main musical instruments used in Koodiyattam are mizhavu, kuzhitalam, edakka, kurumkuzhal, and sankhu. Mizhavu, the most prominent of these, is a percussion instrument that is played by a person of the Ambalavas Nambiar caste, accompanied by Nangyaramma playing the kuzhithalam (a type of cymbal).\\n\\nSection::::Performance style.\\nTraditionally, Koodiyattam has been performed by Chakyars (a subcaste of Kerala Hindus) and by Nangyaramma (women of the Ambalavasi Nambiar caste). The name Koodiyattam, meaning playing or performing together, is thought to refer to the presence or more actors on stage who act in consonance with the beats of the mizhavu drummers. Alternatively, it may also be a reference to a common practice in Sanskrit drama where a single actor who has performed solo for several nights is joined by another.\\n\\nThe main actor is a Chakyar who performs the ritualistic Koothu and Koodiyattam inside the temple or in the Koothambalam. Chakyar women, Illotammas, are not allowed to participate. Instead, the female roles are played by Nangyaramma. Koodiyattam performances are lengthy and elaborate affairs, ranging from 12 to 150 hours spread across several nights. A complete Koodiyattam performance consists of three parts. The first of these is the \"purappadu\" where an actor performs a verse along with the nritta aspect of dance. Following this is the \"nirvahanam\" where the actor, using abhinaya, brings to the audience the mood of the main character of the play. The \"nirvahanam\", a retrospective, takes the audience up to the point where the actual play begins. The final part of the performance is \"koodiyattam\" which is the play itself. While the first two parts are solo acts, Koodiyattam can have as many characters as are required to perform on the stage.\\n\\nThe practice was that elders of the Chakyar community taught it to their youngsters and it was an art form performed only by Chakyars until the 1950s. In 1955 Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar performed Kutiyattam outside the temple for the first time. For performing the art forms outside the temples he faced many problems from the hardline Chakyar community. In his own words:\\n\\nIn 1962, under the leadership of Dr. V. Raghavan, noted art and Sanskrit scholar, Sanskrit Ranga of Madras, invited Guru Mani Madhava Chakyar to perform Kutiyattam in Chennai. Thus for the first time in history Kutiyattam was performed outside Kerala. They presented at Madras on three nights: Kutiyattam scenes from three plays \"Abhiṣeka\",\"Subhadrādhanañjaya\" and \"Nāgānda\".\\n\\nIn early 1960s Maria Christoffer Byrski, a Polish student doing research in Indian theatres at Banaras Hindu University came to study Kootiyattam with Mani Madhava Chakyar and became the first non-Chakyar/nambiar to learn the art form. He stayed in Guru\\'s home at Killikkurussimangalam and studied the art form in traditional Gurukula way.\\n\\n\\nSection::::A dying art form.\\nKoodiyattam has traditionally been an exclusive art form performed in special venues called \"koothambalams\" in Hindu temples and access to these performances were highly restricted to only caste Hindus. Also, performances are lengthy taking up to forty \\ndays to complete. The collapse of the feudal order in the nineteenth century in Kerala led to a curtailment in the patronage extended to Koodiyattam artistes and they faced serious financial difficulties. Following a revival in the early twentieth century, Koodiyattam is once again facing a lack of funding, leading to a severe crisis in the profession. UNESCO has called for the creation of a network of Koodiyattam institutions and gurukalams to nurture the transmission of the art form to future generations and for the development of new audiences besides fostering greater academic research in it. The Margi Theatre Group in Thiruvananthapuram is a notable organisation dedicated to the revival of Kathakali and Koodiyattom in Kerala. Also Nepathya is an exclusive institution to promote Koodiyattam and related art forms working at Moozhikkulam. The Sangeet Natak Akademi, India\\'s National Academy for Music, Dance and Drama, awarded the Sangeet Natak Akademi Award, the highest award for performing artists, to Kutiyattam artists like, Kalamandalam Sivan Namboodiri (2007), Painkulam Raman Chakyar (2010) and Painkulam Damodara Chakyar (2012).\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Koodiyattam', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1154786'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'ZhhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1154887', 'text': 'Canguçu\\n\\nCanguçu (population: 55,956) is a city in Rio Grande do Sul, south Brazil.

Ryan was a long-standing staff member of Goodson-Todman Productions and Mark Goodson Productions, where he created the concept for the game show \"Blockbusters\". Ryan also created the rebus puzzles for the game show \"Classic Concentration\". He was also a writer and creator of puzzles for the game shows \"Body Language\", \"Catch Phrase\", \"Password Plus\" and \"Trivia Trap\".\\n\\nAs senior games executive at Goodson\\'s lottery division, Steve created games with million-dollar payoffs for many state and international lottery game shows including: \"The Big Spin\" for California, \"Bingo-Lotto\" for Lithuania Lottery, \"Bonus Bonanza\" for Massachusetts Lottery, \"A Chance de Ouro\" for Brazil Lottery, \"Flamingo Fortune\" for Florida Lottery, \"Illinois Luckiest\" for Illinois Lottery, \"Instant Riches\" for Illinois Lottery, \"New York Wired\" for New York Lottery, \"\" for Multi-State Lottery, \"Second Chance Sweepstakes\" for Ohio Lottery, \"Telelotto\" for Estonia Lottery, \"Win\\'n Spin\" for South Africa Lottery, \"Zama Zama\" for South Africa Lottery, and \"25th Anniversary Game Show\" for Pennsylvania Lottery.

He began his career as a puzzle columnist at Copley News Service where he created several puzzle and game features for readers across America and other English speaking countries. Those features include “Puzzles & Posers” which is a mixed grill of cerebral calisthenics designed to explore player\\'s powers of reason, logic and ingenuity, and “Zig-Zag” the original word maze-puzzle which challenges players to search for words from given categories. Both features have run non-stop from 1973 and 1975 (respectively) to current day. Both of Ryan\\'s features have the distinction of being Copley News Service\\'s longest running features in the history of the news organization. Creators Syndicate absorbed both features when Copley News Service sold in 2008.\\n\\nDozens of Steve Ryan books have evolved from his puzzle features and his work in television. Steve self-published his first book in 1975 titled “Puzzle Cards.” His “Grape Vine” puzzle in that book is recognized as the earliest known puzzle to utilize what is known as the “freeway rule” within a genre of puzzles known as mazes-with-rules as referenced in SuperMazes by Robert Abbott.\\n\\nWorldwide, many Steve Ryan puzzle books have been translated and published for Chinese, Russian, Czechoslovakian, French, Dutch, Portuguese, Spanish, Indian, Malaysian and Indonesian markets.\\n\\nRyan is also co-author of \"The Encyclopedia of TV Game Shows\", the most comprehensive book of its kind. This encyclopedia is often referred to as the Bible of the game show industry. As a reference book it documents every game show that has ever appeared in a national market whether it be in cable, syndication or network. Three updated editions have been published to date. The book has been used as a \"Jeopardy!\" answer: The answer was, \"\\'Beat the Odds,\\' \\'Music Bingo\\' and \\'Fast Draw\\' are entries in an encyclopedia of these by Schwartz, Ryan & Wostbrock.\" A contestant came in with the correct question, “What are game shows?”\\n\\nIn addition to the books authored by Steve Ryan, his work has appeared in such magazines as \"Games\", \"Nick\", \"Nickelodeon\", \"Nick Toons\" and \"World of Puzzles\" in the U.S. and \"Games & Puzzles\" in the United Kingdom. Will Shortz, while editor at \"Games\" magazine, acknowledged the work of Steve Ryan as some of the best in the world of puzzles.\\n\\nPuzzle creations by Steve Ryan have been utilized by the Game\\'s National Puzzle Test. His puzzles always rate as visually intriguing, with a high rate of contestants attempting to solve, yet with a lower than normal rate of success. That\\'s the secret behind most Steve Ryan creations: visually stimulating and mentally captivating. A basic Steve Ryan philosophy has always been to make a puzzle appear easy to solve, yet quite engaging to conjure the solution.\\n\\nStix & Stones, a box game created by Steve Ryan, received the Parents\\' Choice 2010 Award for new game. After years of challenging fans to solve his brainteasers with pencils, players are asked to put down those pencils and grab a handful of sticks and stones to create images using the fewest possible number of sticks and stones. It\\'s a game that encourages creative thinking with little or no artistic skill required. Ryan likes to say, “If you could play against Pablo Picasso, all you’d have to do is out think him because he has to use the same sticks and stones as you do to create his image.\"\\n\\nAs a child, Ryan was inspired by the mathematical recreations of Henry Dudeney and Sam Loyd.

It is situated on the east bank of the Red River. The community is approximately forty-five miles south of Shreveport on U.S. Highway 71. The population, 2,299 at the 2000 census, is nearly two-thirds African American, most with long family histories in the area. The 2010 census, however, reported 1,964 residents, a decline of 335 persons, or nearly 15 percent during the course of the preceding decade.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nRed River Parish and the Red River Valley were areas of unrest and white paramilitary activity and violence after the Civil War, and especially during the 1870s of Reconstruction. The parish was based on cotton cultivation, dependent on the labor of enslaved African Americans who far outnumbered the whites. After the war, white planters and farmers tried to reestablish dominance over a majority of the population. With emancipation and being granted citizenship and suffrage, African Americans tried to create their own lives.\\n\\nFormed in May 1874 from white militias, the White League in Louisiana was increasingly well-organized in rural areas like Red River Parish. It worked to turn out the Democratic Party, as well as suppress freedmen\\'s civil rights and voting rights. It used violence against officeholders, running some out of town and killing others, and acted near elections to suppress black and white Republican voter turnout.\\n\\nIn one of the more flagrant examples of violence, the White League in August 1874 forced six Republicans from office in Coushatta, then assassinated them before they could leave the state. Victims included the brother and three brothers-in-law of the Republican State Senator Marshall H. Twitchell. Twitchell\\'s wife and her brothers were from a family with long ties in Red River Parish. One of Twitchell\\'s several biographies is an unpublished 1969 dissertation at Mississippi State University in Starkville by the historian Jimmy G. Shoalmire, a Shreveport native and a specialist in Reconstruction studies.\\n\\nThe White League also killed five to twenty freedmen who had been escorting the Republicans and were witnesses to the assassinations. The events became known as the Coushatta Massacre and contributed to the Republican governor\\'s requesting more Federal troops from U.S. President U.S. Grant to help control the state. Ordinary Southerners wrote to the White House describing the terrible conditions and fear they lived under during these years.\\n\\nWith increased fraud, violence and intimidation, white Redeemer Democrats gained control of the state legislature in 1876 and established a new system of one-party rule. They passed laws making elections more complicated and a new constitution with provisions that effectively disenfranchised most African Americans and many poorer whites. This disenfranchisement persisted for decades into the 20th century before passage of civil rights legislation and the Voting Rights Act of 1965.\\n\\nAfter World War II, Dr. Lawrence Edward L\\'Herisson, Sr. (1925-1988), a native of Bossier Parish, built a 23-bed regional rural hospital in Coushatta. He subsequently relocated to Shreveport with his wife, the former Mary Sloan (1925-2016). Coushatta is now served by the 25-bed Christus Coushatta Health Care Center.\\n\\nDr. L\\'Herisson\\'s father-in-law, whom he never met, Lawrence Wiley Sloan (1892-1935,) died in an accident during the early attempt to bring electricity to southern Tennessee. The Tennessee Valley Authority, launched in 1933, honored Sloan by designating his then nine-year-old daughter, Mary, to throw the switch that energized the region.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nCoushatta is located at (32.023162, -93.341775).\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which is land and (2.91%) is water.\\n\\nNorth of Coushatta, Loggy Bayou, which flows from Lake Bistineau, joins the Red River.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nAs of the census of 2000, there were 2,299 people, 738 households, and 512 families residing in the town.

The noise awakens Alex\\'s mother, who finds Daniel dead and is approached by the killer.\\n\\nMarie, hearing the mother\\'s screams, quickly arranges the guest room to make it appear that no one is staying there, and hides under her bed.

There\\'s a lot of intelligence in both the script and in Alexandre Aja\\'s direction..For those who enjoy horror films and don\\'t mind copious quantities of red-dyed fluids, this one is not to be missed.

As time passed, BMW M began to supplement BMW\\'s vehicles portfolio with specially modified higher trim models, for which they are now most known by the general public. These M-badged cars traditionally include modified engines, transmissions, suspensions, interior trims, aerodynamics, and exterior modifications to set them apart from their counterparts. All M models are tested and tuned at BMW\\'s private facility at the Nürburgring racing circuit in Germany.\\nBMW M also remains the only performance based company to cater motorcycles at the same time, specifically the BMW S1000RR.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::Origins.\\nEstablished in May 1972 with 35 employees, it grew to 400 employees by 1988, and is currently an integral part of BMW\\'s market presence. The first racing project was BMW’s 3.0 CSL.\\n\\nAfter the success of BMW M products like \"BMW 3.0 CSL\" in racing venues and the growing market for high performance sports cars, M introduced cars for sale to the public. The first official M-badged car for sale to the public was the M1, revealed at the Paris Motor Show in 1978. The M1, however, was more of a racecar in domestic trim than an everyday driver. The direction of the M cars changed with the 1979 release of the M535i, which was a high performance version of BMW’s popular 5 Series mid-size sedan.\\n\\nIn 1993 BMW Motorsport GmbH changed their name to BMW M GmbH.\\n\\nBMW Motorsport GmbH supplied the 6.1 litre V12 DOHC 48 valve engine that powers the McLaren F1, which, like its engine supplier and manufacturer, has enjoyed plenty of racing success, famously winning the 24 Hours of Le Mans in 1995, the first year of competition for the GTR racing variant.\\n\\nSection::::Recent history.\\nAt present, BMW M has offered modified versions of nearly every BMW nameplate, except for the Z1, 7 Series flagship luxury sedan and the X1 and X3 compact crossover SUVs. There is no BMW M version of the 7 Series, as BMW did not want its flagship saloon to be powered by a high-revving engine, and as the recent top-performing versions (usually the BMW 760Li) have V12 engines which while powerful are considered too heavy for a sporty offshoot. So far the unofficial \"BMW M7\" is the Alpina B7, which is produced on BMW\\'s assembly line though its engine and finishing touches are done by auto tuner Alpina.\\n\\nThe BMW X5 and X6 sport activity vehicles received M derivatives for the 2010 model year onwards. These are the first M vehicles with xDrive four-wheel drive and automatic transmissions, and also the first M-badged SUV models. However, the E70 and E71 X5 and X6 M were actually developed by BMW Group rather than by BMW M.\\n\\nAlthough these are considered the most well known in-house tuning divisions, BMW M has a considerably different philosophy than Mercedes-AMG. BMW M has emphasized tuning only vehicles with \"Lateral agility\" (which has long been the 3 Series, 5 Series, and roadsters), while AMG has created high-performance versions of many of its nameplates, including flagship sedans and SUVs. Accordingly, \"an M car has to be responsive and fundamentally keen on turning as well as accelerating. The M5\\'s technical spec is all about connecting the driver to a car that reacts blindingly fast, whatever request the driver hands down.\" Until the 2010 model year, BMW M has also never used supercharging or turbocharging, unlike Mercedes-AMG or Audi; for instance the E39 and E60 iterations of the BMW M5 (using naturally-aspirated engines) competed against the Mercedes-Benz E55 AMG (with a supercharged V8) and the Audi RS6 (twin-turbo).\\nBMW M vehicles typically used manuals and semi-automatic transmissions (the most recent type being a dual clutch transmission), in contrast to Mercedes-AMG which largely has automatic transmissions (the 7-speed AMG SpeedShift MCT dual clutch transmission was used on new models from 2009 onward). However, the BMW X5 M and X6 M were the first M-vehicles offered with automatic transmission, a 6-speed Steptronic unit, since this works with xDrive.\\n\\nBMW M engines were traditionally large displacement naturally aspirated high revving engines, particularly the S85 V10 in the E60 M5 and E63 M6 and the related S65 V8 in the E90 M3. These are the most powerful engines BMW has ever built (not including the BMW S70/2) without supercharging or turbocharging, with an output of 100\\xa0hp per liter of displacement, and each has won numerous International Engine of the Year Awards.\\n\\nHowever, the late 2000s international regulations trends on reducing CO2 emissions and fuel consumption are cited as the reasons not to continue further development on naturally aspirated high redline engines. The N54 twin-turbo inline-6 which debuted in the 2007 BMW 335i (E90) gives almost equivalent performance to the E46 and E90 iterations of the BMW M3, while being much more practical and fuel-efficient as a daily driver. Starting with the X5 M and X6 M, and featured in the F10 M5, BMW used the twin-turbocharged S63 which not only produces more horsepower and torque, but is also more efficient than the S85 V10. Also unlike the S85 and S65 which do not share a design with non-M BMW engines, the S63 has significant parts commonality with the base N63 V8 engine (which is also has twin turbochargers) making them less expensive to build. At the present (2012), BMW has not considered supercharging yet.\\n\\nAs of the 2013 model year, the BMW M3 (E92/E93) is the only \"traditional\" M car left, as the rest of the M lineup features turbocharged engines, and the next iteration of the M3 (F80) and M4 (F82/F83) features a twin turbo straight-6 engine.\\n\\nSection::::M-Cars vs. M-badged cars.\\nThere are several BMW models which BMW Motorsport made changes on, without them becoming M-Cars. This succession of styling (M-tech I, M-tech II) and performance cues came from BMW Motorsports; e.g. BMW 530i M packet or 325i \"M packet\" etc.\\n\\nVehicles which have been modified by BMW Motorsport, but are not full \"M Cars\", may feature \"M\" badges, whilst full M Cars will have \"M\" badges with the model number (e.g., \"M4\" or \"M5\"). Two exceptions would be the M Roadster and M Coupe models, both Z3, Z4 and 1 Series variants, which only have an \"M\" badge with no number displayed on the trunk. These cars are full M Cars.\\n\\nIn recent years, there have been \\'M\\'-badged accessories available on BMW\\'s standard fleet as factory options or as part of the \"M Sport\" package (which is more expensive than the optional Sport package). Examples of this include the E39 and E60 5 series sedans which had optional aerodynamic packages that were strongly influenced by the M5\\'s styling (for example, bumpers with larger intakes). It is not unusual to see \"standard\" BMW vehicles with \"M\" badges or ribbons accenting their design. The plain motorsports badge simply stands for the \\'M-tech\\' upgrades equipped on the vehicle (e.g., suspension, brakes, looks or any other modification that has been developed by the M division), therefore the \\'M\\' badge on these vehicles should not be confused with the true \\'M\\' vehicles (except the Z-cars, as mentioned), as they are not fully fledged \\'M\\' cars, just equipped with \\'M\\'-tech upgrades. BMW has offered these \\'M\\' options on their standard vehicles since the late 1970s which explains why these vehicles carry \\'M\\' badges straight from the factory. In comparison, vehicle maker Audi also employs this same type of nomenclature. There are fully fledged \\'S\\' models (S4, S5, S6, S7 and TTS), as well as an optional \"S\\'-line package that can be equipped to their standard vehicle lineup.\\n\\nAn example of \\'M\\'-badged vehicles in recent times include the E60 BMW 550i and E63 BMW 650i. The standard BMW 5 Series and 6 Series only had a choice of either a manual or automatic transmission, but the \\'M\\' Sport package had an optional Sequential Sport Gearbox (SSG) (a gearbox similar to M5 and M6 (SMG) until after the 2007 model year.\\n\\nSection::::M Performance models.\\nRecently (2012) BMW has introduced a new category for \\'M\\' cars, which was branded as the \\'M\\' Performance. They are the first M diesel cars that BMW produces.\\n\\nTo date this includes the M550d in touring and saloon variants, the X6 M50d and X5 M50d which all share a 381\\xa0bhp 740NM triple turbo diesel engine, the former pair are only LHD drive markets currently due to the xDrive layout in the F10 series not being compatible with RHD markets (a RWD F10 M550d was mentioned by Auto Express but has not been confirmed). Official figures put the M550d xDrive’s 0-to-62-mph time at 4.7 seconds and top speed at 155mph (limited).The first petrol M Performance car is the M135i which is a 320\\xa0bhp 1 series car. M135i is available with rear- or all-wheel drive.\\n\\nThe M550d is available in both sedan and touring chassis, with a ZF 8HP eight-speed sport automatic transmission including auto start/stop function. Manual and non-sport automatic gearboxes are not available.\\nUnique features on the M550d are the twin trapezoidal exhausts in dark chrome and both wing mirrors and air-intake bars in ferric grey. Other 5 series models have wing mirrors in the same colour as the rest of the vehicle. The front fog lamps, standard on all other F10/F11 5 series models are removed, to make space for additional air-intakes. The door-sill plates are also unique on this vehicle, having a \"M550d\" inscription. \\nIn addition, the F11 Touring model features air suspension on the rear axle, with automatic self-levelling.\\n\\nNothing yet has been announced as regards the F30 3 Series M Performance line up but BMW have trademarked (amongst many other monikers) M335, M340 and M350. Further to this M President Friedrich Nitschke has confirmed that the new triple turbo diesel engine will \"easily fit\" within the F30 engine bay but did not elaborate any further.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::Lineup.\\nSection::::M badged cars.\\nAll these cars are true BMW Motorsport models, not M-line sport models that bear BMW Motorsport features such as sport body kits, and interior specs.\\n\\n\\nSection::::M engined cars.\\nIn the late 80s, due to prohibitive taxes for cars above 2.0 liters of engine displacement in Italy and Portugal, BMW decided to build the E30 320is as an alternative to the 2.3 liter M3. This car was equipped with a shorter stroke S14 engine and produced 192 PS. BMW produced a total of 3648 units between 9/1987 and 11/1990 of which a majority of 2542 units were made available in two door form (code name AK95). No catalytic converters were installed on this limited version. The steering rack, springs, shock absorbers, and brakes were similar to the normal E30 6 cylinder models (i.e. 325i) with sports suspension. The engine was mated to a Getrag 265 five-speed gearbox in dog-leg configuration.\\n\\nSection::::Competition.\\nAudi\\'s RS models, Mercedes-Benz\\'s AMG models, and more recently Lexus F model(s), are often reviewed in direct competition to a similarly-sized BMW M car, such as the Lexus IS-F vs. Audi RS4 vs. Mercedes C63 AMG vs. BMW M3.\\n\\nIn contrast to aftermarket tuners, Alpina BMW-based automobiles are currently mostly built by BMW on its production lines and are more comfort-oriented. Alpina is recognized as an automobile manufacturer and works very closely with BMW, sometimes participating in the development of BMW models and engines. Some Alpina models are even sold in North-America by BMW and either compete with the BMW M6 Gran Coupé, in the case of the Alpina B6 Gran Coupé, or replace them, in the case of the Alpina B7 as there is no M7 variant of the 7 Series to compete with the model.\\n\\nBMW M also faces competition from several independent companies offering their own performance versions of BMW models; some performance packs can be retrofitted to existing cars while others are applied to new cars bought directly from BMW AG and converted prior to first registration. Such companies include Hamann Motorsport, Dinan Cars, G-Power, AC Schnitzer and Hartge.\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'BMW M', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1158851'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'dxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11589054', 'text': 'Rancho Boca de Santa Monica\\n\\nRancho Boca de Santa Monica (mouth of Santa Monica) was a Mexican land grant in present day Los Angeles County, California given by governor Juan Alvarado in 1839 to Ysidro Reyes and Francisco Marquez.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nIn 1839, Ysidro Reyes (1813–1861) and Francisco Marquez (1798–1850) were granted Rancho Boca de Santa Monica, comprising what is now Santa Monica Canyon, the Pacific Palisades, and parts of Topanga Canyon.\\n\\nFrancisco Marquez and his wife, Roque Valenzuela, built an adobe house in the upper mesa of the canyon.

Even as late as the \"1940s and early 1950s some high British officials still believed that Persian petroleum was actually and rightly British petroleum because it had been discovered by the British, developed by British capital, and exploited through British skill and British ingenuity.\"\\n\\nIn stark contrast, Iranian Premier Mohammad Mosaddegh believed the 1933 concession granted to the AIOC by Iran was \"immoral as well as illegal\". Mosaddeq \"challenged every aspect of the British commercial presence in Iran\". The British feared that if Mosaddeq\\'s policies prevailed, \"nationalists throughout the world could abrogate British concessions with impunity.\"\\n\\nSection::::Nationalization.\\nThe AIOC was nationalized by the Iranian Parliament in March 1951. In Iran this was enormously popular and seen as a long overdue staunching of the bleeding of its national wealth which could now be harnessed to fighting poverty in Iran. In Britain, the nationalisation was widely seen as an intolerable breach of contract or theft. British emissaries in the United States after the nationalisation, argued that allowing Iran to nationalise the oil company \"would be widely regarded as a victory for the Russians\" and would also \"cause a loss of one hundred million pounds per annum in the United Kingdom\\'s balance of payments, thus seriously affecting our rearmament program and our cost of living.\"\\n\\nBritish warships blockaded Abadan. On 22 August, the British cabinet imposed a series of economic sanctions on Iran. It prohibited exports of key British commodities, including sugar and steel, directed the withdrawal of all British personnel from Iranian oil fields and all but a hard core of about 300 administrators from Abadan and blocked Iran\\'s access to its hard currency accounts in British banks.\\n\\nAfter the withdrawal of the British workers in the fall of 1951, the Iranians felt confident that they could easily hire non-British technicians to run the industry and then quickly train their own nationals to replace them. Unfortunately, this did not prove to be the case; the United States, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Pakistan, and West Germany all refused to make their technicians available to the nationalized Iranian industry. Only Italy agreed, demonstrating that most industrialized countries supported Britain over Iran in the nationalization dispute.\"\\n\\nIn July 1952, the Royal Navy intercepted the Italian tanker \"Rose Mary\" and forced it into the British protectorate of Aden on the grounds that the ship\\'s petroleum was stolen property. News that the Royal Navy was intercepting tankers carrying Iranian oil scared off other tankers and effectively shut down oil exports from Iran.\\n\\nSupporters of the nationalization, including the National Poet of Iran Adib Boroumand, sent out propaganda in the form of poetry in support of Mossadegh\\'s movement. Poems were read out on radio broadcasts, passed out to people on paper pamphlets, and published in newspapers.\\n\\nSection::::Coup d\\'état.\\nThe democratically elected government of Iran was overthrown on 19 August 1953, following a coup d\\'état orchestrated by the United Kingdom and the United States, and Iranian Prime Minister Mohammed Mossadegh was ousted from power. During the coup, codenamed Operation Ajax, the CIA and MI6 restored Mohammad Reza Pahlavi to power. In August 1954, the AIOC was set under the control of an international consortium. Initially, ownership shares in the consortium proposed to be divided along the following lines: 40% to be divided equally (8% each) among the five major American companies; British Petroleum to have a 40% share; Royal Dutch/Shell to have 14%; and CFP, a French Company, to receive 6%. Iran now received 25% of the profits compared to 20% of the original treaty with the AIOC. Saudi-Arabia and other oil-exploiting countries of the region received up to 50% of the profits in cooperation with American oil companies at the same time.\\n\\nIt was only in 1980, after the US and British backed Shah regime was ousted through a people\\'s uprising in 1979, that the oil company was nationalized into what is today known as the NIOC (National Iranian Oil Company).\\n\\n', 'title': 'Abadan Crisis', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1159294'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'eRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11593724', 'text': \"Reuben L.

Col. Ezekiel Cushing purchased the island in 1732 and is credited with being the first European to settle and build a house on the island. He died in 1765, and willed the island to his nine surviving children. Soon after, other settlers arrived to make a livelihood out of farming, fishing, and catching lobsters.\\n\\nDuring World War II, Casco Bay became United States Navy base \"Sail\" for destroyers escorting HX, SC, and ON convoys of the Battle of the Atlantic. Facilities constructed on the island included the Torpedo Control Officers School of the Portland Naval Training Center, a navy supply pier with a naval fuel annex often cited as a source of contamination for both the island\\'s marsh and Casco Bay, and the Naval Auxiliary Air Facility Casco Bay (NAAF) seaplane base operated as part of Naval Air Station Brunswick from 14 May 1943 to 15 December 1946.\\n\\nAfter the war, tourism became the most popular industry, and several small stores, a fire station, and a K-5 school (1953) were built. In the summer, several hundred or even thousands of tourists travel from places such as Massachusetts and New York to vacation in their summer cottages.\\n\\nThe island was originally part of the city of Portland, which re-evaluated property taxes in 1990. Due in part to high real estate prices paid by out-of-state residents and property aesthetic values, property taxes increased substantially. Many residents felt this move created an unfair discrepancy between the money paid to the City of Portland and the services they received in return. The island voted to secede from Portland, and on July 1, 1993, the island was declared the Town of Long Island. The Long Island Historical Society now houses every news article that was printed about the secession movement as well as video and film footage of the secession ceremonies. These archives also include copies of the local and national news coverage given to the community during its \"rebellion\".\\n\\nSection::::Long Island today.\\nLong Island is still a popular destination in the summer, and is a 45-minute ferry ride from Portland. Popular attractions include South Beach (also known as Sandy Beach). The first 2/3 of this beach are state owned. The last third or so is privately owned. Another beach is Fowler\\'s Beach, located on the western end of Long Island, although this is commonly reserved for residents of the island. Popular hiking areas of the island include the town\\'s Conservation Area, often referred to as \"The Area\", and the back shore rocks, located toward the East End.\\n\\nIndependence Day events include a parade of floats, the vehicles of the Volunteer Fire Department, a Mr. and Ms. Town of Long Island election and an award ceremony for the most creative floats.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Long Island, Maine', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=115942', 'cat_id': '115942', 'cat_title': 'Early_Modern_Ireland', 'cat_pages': '32', 'cat_subcats': '6', 'cat_files': '0'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'exhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1159441', 'text': 'Beverley Mahood\\n\\nBeverley Mahood (born 2 November 1974 in Belfast, Northern Ireland) is a country music singer-songwriter and television host in Canada.

The plant used high grade concentrates from the mines at Broken Hill and as they were owned by the same controlling interests these came from the Zinc Corporation and New Broken Hill Consolidated Mines.\\nTo haul the concentrates the New South Wales Government Railways modified 80 G class open wagons by permanently closing the bottom discharge doors to form the GC wagon.

It is in the local government area of the City of Darebin. It is 4 or 5\\xa0km from Melbourne\\'s central business district, just north of Clifton Hill, and a few hundred metres south of the main part of Northcote. Merri Creek forms its western border, and to the east lies Fairfield.\\n\\nWestgarth is part of Northcote for administrative purposes, although it retains its own geographically distinct commercial centre.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nBefore European occupation, the area was home to the Wurundjeri people. Land c.2\\xa0km to the south, where Merri Creek meets the Yarra, was an early site of colonial contact, briefly home to the Native Police Corps in 1842, and a school for Aboriginal children until 1851. Land sales first occurred in the Northcote area in 1840, and land was purchased in the area then known as Northcote-by-the-Merri (now Westgarth) but not immediately developed. Three of the buyers later had streets named after them - Cunningham, Urquhart and Walker. As Northcote, Victoria developed in the mid-to-late 19th century, Northcote-by-the-Merri became known as Northcote South. Land was gazetted for development in 1853, but development was relatively slow. All Saints Anglican church on High Street Westgarth dates to 1860 (present building, 1870), and the Bridge Hotel to 1864.\\n\\nWestgarth\\'s development accelerated - along with that of many other Melbourne suburbs - in the economic boom of the 1880s. As the children of the Gold Rush generation formed their own families, Melbourne\\'s population swelled. The Victorian Parliament reacted by using railway lines to open up new housing areas. The railway line from Clifton Hill to Alphington was opened in 1884, and the railway station was linked to Melbourne via a western loop in 1888. A cable tram line down High Street to Clifton Hill was opened in 1886, faltered after the land market collapse of 1892, and opened and closed again until reopening permanently in 1901. Building continued through the Edwardian era and into the 1920s, and in 1925 the Northcote tram (now route 86) was connected right through to the city centre. The present commercial and shopping strip along High St. dates to the early 20th century, and Westgarth Primary School to 1925, when it opened as Westgarth Central School. The suburb won its present name between 1906 and 1910, with the decision to name the railway station after William Westgarth. The art nouveau Westgarth Theatre, the suburb\\'s best-known landmark, opened in 1920.\\n\\nThe 1960s and 1970s saw an influx of southern European immigrants to the area, in common with other City of Darebin suburbs. By the 1970s the Westgarth Theatre catered largely to a Greek-speaking cinema audience. Westgarth school photos and class lists from the 1970s are dominated by Greek names and faces. That influence began to fade in the 1980s, with the arrival of a new generation of Westgarth residents with higher incomes and education levels. The process of gentrification accelerated through the 1990s, fuelled by the suburb\\'s central location, attractive streets and housing stock, and its proximity to pricier inner-city suburbs including Fitzroy, Clifton Hill and North Fitzroy. The Westgarth Theatre became an art-house movie venue in 1986 when the Valhalla Cinema relocated there after the demolition of its original premises in Richmond. Ten years later, it became the Westgarth Cinema, now part of the Palace Group. A number of industrial buildings along High St. were converted to residential use in the late 1990s and early first decade of the 21st century. Westgarth Primary School\\'s original building was demolished in 1990 and replaced by an open-plan building, extended in 2011.\\n\\nSection::::World War II.\\nA partially excavated tunnel and bunker is located in Westgarth on the north bank of Merri Creek about 30 metres downstream from where a trail crosses the stream near the southwest corner of Oldis Gardens and East Street. The tunnel entrance is locked and it is reported that it lies under a high pressure gas pipeline.\\n\\nSection::::Westgarth today.\\nToday, Westgarth retains its southern European presence, with many children of the 1960s and 1970s immigrant wave still living in the area. But Westgarth also houses a wide variety of other cultural and language groups. Gentrification has brought back some of the children of Melbourne residents who moved to middle and outer suburbs in the 1950s and 1960s. The area is now known for its local artists, and a lesbian community has also been associated with Westgarth for some years. The best-known local resident is the Australian actor Vince Colosimo.\\n\\nThe Westgarth Cinema remains the centre of the small commercial strip at the southern end of High Street, which is now populated by bohemian fashion outlets, cafes and other retail businesses. The strip remains noticeably less developed than its counterparts in Clifton Hill and Fairfield, arguably due in part to the traffic intensity of the relatively narrow High Street. New development has been rare, although new businesses open every few months and apartments above shops were constructed in 2009 and again in 2011. The lack of local shops means most Westgarth residents currently travel to other suburbs for groceries and many other needs. Retaining the \"village\" feel of Westgarth, against mounting commercial pressures to redevelop Victorian heritage buildings and development sites, was the aim of the now-defunct \"Save Westgarth Village\" campaign.\\n\\nThe Westgarth Cinema was one of the last two remaining single-screen venues in Melbourne, until being redeveloped in 2006. After several years of uncertainty about its commercial survival, the family owners finally sold it to Palace Cinemas in 2005, while retaining ownership of the building. Although many original features have been preserved, it is now a popular multiplex with a 300-seat cinema downstairs and now four smaller cinemas upstairs.\\n\\nThe train line through Westgarth station is now part of the Hurstbridge line, following an easterly route into the city. A second, proximate station on the Mernda line, Rushall, is accessed via a pedestrian and cyclist bridge over the Merri Creek (the bridge connects through to an east-west cycle route along Linear Park, one of the nicest such parks in Melbourne). The High Street tram line is now part of Melbourne tram route 86. Upgrading the tram line occurred in 2011, with three stops reduced to two in Westgarth and increased dangers to cyclists and pedestrians close to the relocated central stop. The tram changes are noted in Council consultation and in many media articles and community campaigns. In August 2013, in the last phase of the tram works, metal sculptures designed by Syrinx Environmental were added to the new median strip, producing a local outcry on social media and featuring in the national press. The Council voted to remove them again after 3 weeks.\\n\\nThe Jika Jika Community centre on Plant Street is the main meeting place for local events and activities.\\n\\nSection::::Education.\\nWestgarth Primary School is the area\\'s main school, although Merri Creek, Fairfield and Spensley Street Schools are closer by distance for many Westgarth residents. Westgarth Primary was founded in 1924 as Westgarth Central School, Number 4177 in the Victorian system. Originally Primary to Year 8, it eventually became primary-only. It now caters to approximately 650 students in grades from preparatory to year six. It has two campuses, Clarke St (for Grade 3-6 students), and Brooke St (for students in years Prep-2). It has a kindergarten attached to the Clarke St campus. It is one of the biggest primary schools in the region and is currently seeking government funding to redevelop its facilities to cater for significant growth in student numbers.

The population was 2,381 at the 2010 census. Popular with tourists, Hallowell is noted for its culture and old architecture. Hallowell is included in the Augusta, Maine micropolitan New England City and Town Area.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nThe city is named for Benjamin Hallowell, a Boston merchant and one of the Kennebec Proprietors, holders of land originally granted to the Plymouth Company by the British monarchy in the 1620s.\\n\\nFirst to settle here was Deacon Pease Clark, who emigrated with his wife and son Peter from Attleborough, Massachusetts, in the spring of 1762. Legend has it that after disembarking on the west side of the Kennebec, near present-day Water Street, the Clarks took shelter in their overturned cart. On a riverfront lot measuring 50 rods (275 yards, about 250 meters), the Clark family raised corn, rye and other crops. The first land they cleared was occupied by the fire department in 1859.\\n\\nIn 1797, the modern city of Augusta split from Hallowell to be a separate town. The part of Hallowell that is the current city was then known as \"The Hook\". Today, the city\\'s population (2,467) is only slightly smaller than it was in 1820, the year Maine seceded from Massachusetts and became a state. Yet 183 years ago, Hallowell\\'s inhabitants enjoyed the services of 71 stores along Water Street (by contrast, Augusta had a population of 1,000 and just 20 merchants).\\n\\nThriving industries included logging, trading, publishing and shipbuilding. Location on the navigable Kennebec River estuary allowed 50 ships launched from Hallowell\\'s wharves to reach the Atlantic Ocean between 1783 and 1901. Two grist mills, five sawmills and two slaughterhouses served the needs of residents near and far.\\n\\nIn 1815, the first granite quarried near the Manchester town line signaled the birth of an industry that would support Hallowell until 1908, when cement displaced stone as the construction material of choice. In 1826, the ice industry began in earnest, employing thousands over the next 75 years. Frozen blocks loaded onto Hallowell\\'s schooners were delivered to Cuba and the West Indies. Other local products exported via the Kennebec (and, after 1857, by train) from Hallowell included sandpaper, textiles from cotton from the Deep South, rope, linseed oil, oilcloth, wire, books and shoes.\\n\\nWhile the Kennebec River sustained the city from its inception, this mighty freeway also inspired fear. Spring floods regularly terrorized shopkeepers and sometimes brought commerce to a standstill.

The cavity formed between the layers is pressurized with air producing a rigid structural element which allows large span structures to be achieved. The key difference between air-supported buildings and inflatable buildings is that air-supported buildings require airlocks at all the access points to prevent air being lost when doors are opened since the entire occupied space of the building is pressurized.\\n\\nSection::::Structure.\\nAn inflatable building only requires pressurized air within the cavities of the walls and so does not require airlocks since the occupied interior of the building is at normal atmospheric pressure. Since a much lower volume of air is pressurized, inflatable buildings require less power for continuous operation.\\n\\nThe air contained within the walls of an inflatable building becomes a true structural part of the building. The membranes used in the construction of such buildings are typically less than 1mm thick, so the amount of membrane used compared to the volume of air contained within the walls is incredibly low (typically less than 0.5%). This makes inflatable buildings efficient in terms of the amount of raw materials required to construct them.\\n\\nThe small amount of material used in the construction of inflatable buildings makes them highly portable. When a building needs to be moved, the air can simply be allowed to escape enabling an entire building to be packed into a small volume compared to its inflated size. The building can then be transported easily to its new location and re-inflated.\\n\\nSection::::Types.\\nInflatable structures and inflatable buildings are used in many ways including membrane roofs and covers, sails, buildings and pavilions, airships, furniture, airspace structures, boats, escape slides, security mattresses, swimming pools, coverings, games and castles, air bags and many other applications. Examples include an inflatable church and an inflatable pub.\\n\\n\\nSection::::References.\\nhttp://inflatable.pub/\\n', 'title': 'Inflatable building', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11605730'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'gxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11606954', 'text': 'Andrew Russell\\n\\nAndrew Russell may refer to:\\n\\n\\n', 'title': 'Andrew Russell', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11606954'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11608122', 'text': 'Nicholas Elko\\n\\nNicholas Thomas Elko (December 14, 1909 – May 18, 1991) was the third bishop of the Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh, the American branch of the Ruthenian Catholic Church. At the age of 46 he became the first American-born Bishop of the Greek Catholic Church. He later served as Auxiliary Bishop of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati, Ohio.\\n\\nSection::::Early life.\\nBorn on December 14, 1909, to Rusyn immigrant parents in Donora, Pennsylvania, a steel town in the Monongahela River Valley, he attended the public schools there and in 1930 graduated from Duquesne University in Pittsburgh. He completed graduate theological studies at the Greek Catholic Seminary in Uzhhorod and at the Catholic University of Leuven in Belgium. Bishop Basil Takach ordained him to the priesthood on September 30, 1934, at St. Nicholas Greek Catholic Church in McKeesport, Pennsylvania.\\n\\nHe next served as pastor in several parishes throughout the Exarchate and as the spiritual director of the Greek Catholic Union of the USA, the oldest continuous fraternal benefit society for Rusyn immigrants and their descendants in the U.S. Elko also served in the administration of the Exarchate as Dean of the Cleveland Deanery, Consultor, and eventually as Vicar General. Pope Pius XII in 1952 named him a domestic prelate with the title of Reverend Monsignor. He was appointed that same year as the Rector of the Exarchate\\'s new seminary, the Byzantine Catholic Seminary of SS. Cyril and Methodius. \\n\\nBishop Daniel Ivancho appointed Elko in 1954 as the Rector of St. John the Baptist Byzantine Catholic Cathedral. Yet just three months later, Ivancho abruptly resigned as bishop, and the Holy See directed Elko, as the Vicar General of the Exarchate, to administer it. On February 16, 1955, Archbishop Amleto Giovanni Cicognani, the Vatican\\'s delegate to the United States, announced that Elko would be elevated to the episcopacy. On March 6, 1955, he was ordained as Bishop at St. Peter\\'s Basilica in Rome, Italy, by Cardinal Eugène-Gabriel-Gervais-Laurent Tisserant, Dean of the College of Cardinals and the Secretary of the Congregation for the Oriental Churches.\\n\\nSection::::Episcopate of Bishop Elko.\\nThe formerly immigrant Ruthenian Church was by the 1950s now overwhelmingly American-born and modernizing rapidly in the post-World War II era. Bishop Elko sought to engage the new generation by leading change within the Exarchate. He immediately sought and was granted permission by Rome to permit English, in addition to the ancient liturgical language Old Church Slavonic, to be used in the celebration of the Divine Liturgy. \\n\\nHe next established in 1956 a new weekly newspaper, \"The Byzantine Catholic World\". The term \"Byzantine Catholic\" was relatively new and represented something of a re-branding for the Church. The term began in usage in the 1940s in an effort to clarify the ritual identification of the Church to the majority American Latin-Rite Catholics, replacing the traditional European appellation of \"Greek Catholic\". The Church roots were historically \"Greek\" in the sense that Christianity came to the Slavs in the 9th century by the missionary brothers Saint Cyril and Saint Methodius. But the new name aimed to evoke the even older and more glorious history of Eastern Christianity in Constantinople and the Byzantine Empire.\\n\\nElko\\'s administration also undertook the construction of more than one hundred churches and schools. However, in the spirit of modernism, Elko recommended that many traditional Byzantine architectural features, such iconostasis, or as icon screens, be omitted or removed from the new or renovated churches. The Church\\'s membership, largely in the northeastern United States, began to migrate to the West. Elko assigned priests to do organizational work there, and established new parishes in California and Alaska. \\n\\nSection::::Rome upgrades the American Church\\'s status.\\nSince its inception in 1924 as the \"Apostolic Exarchate of United States of America, Faithful of the Oriental Rite (Ruthenian)\", the organizational status of Elko\\'s American Greek Catholic Church was merely that of a missionary territory with limited self-governing authority, the homeland being Europe—albeit under Communist persecution since 1946. \\n\\nOn July 6, 1963, the Vatican upgraded the status of the church from Exarchate to Eparchy, or diocese according to the Latin-Rite terminology. A decree by the newly elected Pope Paul VI divided the entire U.S. territory of the Church into two separate ecclesiastical jurisdictions. The first, centered in Passaic, New Jersey, included the Eastern states and the second jurisdiction, centered in Pittsburgh, included the rest of the nation. Both jurisdictions now held the canonical status of an eparchy or a full diocese. Elko continued as the American Church\\'s senior hierarch, but a new bishop, Stephen Kocisko, was installed for Passaic. \\n\\nSection::::The Second Vatican Council and the Eastern Catholic Churches.\\nElko was appointed a Consultor to the Congregation for the Oriental Churches and took part in the proceedings, held in Rome from 1962–1965, of the Second Vatican Council. It issued a decree, promulgated by Paul VI on November 21, 1964, titled \"Orientalium Ecclesiarum\". The new policy underscored the richness of the Eastern Rite churches and respect for them. It urged Eastern Rites to return to the roots of their distinctive rituals and to avoid Latinization of their practices.\\n\\nThe decree heartened conservatives in the Byzantine Church, and to many seemed a repudiation of Elko\\'s \"reforms\", particularly during the building boom of the previous years.\\n\\nSection::::Controversy.\\nBy 1967, Elko\\'s popularity within his own Church waned on account of the rapid change he led, the confusion among laity around many Vatican II reforms, and especially Elko\\'s authoritarian management style. Whether priest or laity, liberal or conservative, many in the Church were agitated by Elko\\'s leadership. Petitions were signed and sent off to Rome. The Vatican, fearing more dissension in the Church like that experienced during the 1930s, transferred Elko to Rome, where he was elevated to the dignity of an Archbishop and appointed as the ordaining prelate for the Byzantine Catholics in Rome and head of the Ecumenical Commission on the Liturgy. This prompted his resignation as Byzantine Catholic Bishop of Pittsburgh, and Monsignor Edward V. Rosack, the Chancellor of the Eparchy, was named as the temporary apostolic administrator.\\n\\n\"Time Magazine\" reported on the unusual situation, noting that a \"\"bishop is almost never separated from his see. For the past seven months, however, the Most Rev. Nicholas T. Elko, Ruthenian-rite bishop of Pittsburgh, has been in Rome, barred by his church superiors from returning to his diocese. The case of Bishop Elko, who describes his situation as \\'exile\\', casts fascinating light on Catholicism\\'s current internal stresses...\"\". Three years later, the Vatican sent Elko back to the U.S., but not to his Byzantine Church. \\n\\nSection::::Transition: The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati.\\nIn 1970 Archbishop Elko started anew as Auxiliary Archbishop in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Cincinnati (the first and only Eastern Rite Bishop to serve as Auxiliary of a Latin Rite Diocese in the U.S.). He served in this capacity for fourteen years, and upon reaching his seventy-fifth birthday, retired.\\n\\nHe wrote an historical novel at this time, which was published posthumously in 1994. \"White Heat Over Red Fire\" features Thomas Christophe, a young Eastern Rite Catholic Bishop ministering in post-war Austria. The novel makes much of the intrigues of the Cold War years, the struggles of the Church in Eastern Europe, the attempts to reconcile the Catholic and Orthodox Churches, and the upheaval within the Catholic Church in the wake of Vatican II.\\n\\nIn 1987, Archbishop Elko, asked me to help him create a charity, where The Rosary would be sent to missions. With his permission, I named the project \"Rosaries Around The World\" He provided an Archdiocesan Directory and we created stationary for the letters to the missionaries. I sent out hundreds of letters and received an incredible response. In a 3 year span, we mailed over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Brown Scapulars and many other items, to world wide missions. We even received a personal letter from St. Mother Teresa. She received thousands for her houses around the globe. Fr. Malachy Brogan, a Franciscan missionary in the Philippines wrote to me this quote-\"Jim, your Rosaries are now to be found in the hands of the praying, the dying and the dead.\" The good Archbishop\\'s brother funded this project and this very Marian Archbishop left me with many stories to share. This was the highlight...Jim Hungler, his Altar Boy, driver, confidante and friend. Archbishop Pilarczyk allowed me to serve Archbishops Funeral Mass, RIP Your Grace. \\n\\nElko died on May 18, 1991, aged 81.\\nHe is interred in the Priest\\'s Circle at Gate of Heaven Cemetery, Montgomery, Ohio.\\n\\n\\n\\nSection::::References.\\nI had the honor to be Archbishop Elko\\'s assistant for 3 years. He was a true son of Mary and loved our Lord and lived the life. In the last 2 years I was with him, we created a mission project entitled: \"ROSARIES AROUND THE WORLD\". We shipped to over 40 countries and a total of over 1,000,000 Rosaries and Scapulars. They went from St. Mother Teresa to Fr. Malachy Brogan, OFM. He wrote me once saying: \"Jim, the Rosaries you sent are now found in the hands of the praying, the dying and the dead.\" This was funded in total by the good Archbishop\\'s brother and blessed by Archbishop Elko and St. Pope John Paul II. \\n', 'title': 'Nicholas Elko', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11608122'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'hRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1160830', 'text': \"Swan Districts Football Club\\n\\nThe Swan Districts Football Club, nicknamed the Swans, is an Australian rules football club playing in the West Australian Football League (WAFL). The club is based at Bassendean Oval, in Bassendean, an eastern suburb of Perth, Western Australia. The club was formed in 1932, and joined the then-Western Australian National Football League (WANFL) in 1934, acting as a successor to the Midland Junction Football Club, which had disbanded during World War I, in the Perth Hills region.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSwan Districts finished seventh on the WANFL ladder winning seven out of 21 games in their debut season in 1934. The presence of established WANFL players like inaugural captain-coach “Judda” Bee from East Fremantle and Fred Sweetapple from West Perth was critical to the fledgling club's competitiveness. In 1935, Swans finished sixth on the WANFL Ladder with six wins and twelve losses and George Krepp won the Sandover Medal. The 1936 season saw the Swans pick up nine wins and eleven losses but still finish seventh on the League Ladder.\\n\\nThe 1937 season saw Swan Districts, under new coach Jim Ditchburn, finish in third place on the League Ladder with 14 wins and 7 losses, and play in their first finals series. Ted Holdsworth kicked 109 goals in the first 14 games before injury ended his season and East Perth beat them in the first semi-final 13.9 (87) to 11.7 (73). Swan Districts had another good season in 1938, finishing third with 11 wins and nine losses but were again beaten in the first semi-final by East Perth 8.18 (66) – 9.11 (65).\\n\\nIn 1939, with the loss of champion spearhead Holdsworth to Kalgoorlie, Swans slid to sixth on the ladder with seven wins from twenty games. In the following two seasons, despite Holdsworth's return, the club slid still further to finish last with only two wins in 1940 and three in 1941. Due to the Second World War the WANFL suspended its senior competition and implemented an under age competition to replace it. In 1942 Swans were unable to raise a side to play and did not compete at all. By 1943 Swan Districts assembled a side to compete in the under-age competition and performed exceedingly well, finishing fourth on the ladder with nine wins and eight losses, then winning the first semi-final against West Perth and the preliminary Final against Subiaco. Swans thus played in their first Grand Final only to be defeated by East Fremantle, the final score being East Fremantle 17.15 (117) to Swan Districts 11.11 (77). Jim Davies became the second Swan Districts player to win a Sandover Medal in 1944 with 33 votes in what was otherwise a forgettable season with Swans finishing sixth on the ladder, but in the restored open-age competition of 1945 their fortunes improved as they finished fourth on the league ladder only to be defeated in the first semi-final by South Fremantle.\\nHowever, Swan Districts fell off dramatically for the next fifteen seasons. During this period they never finished higher than sixth of eight teams, and overall won only sixty-one and drew one of their 301 matches, suffering from the fact that much of the area around Bassendean was “un-allotted” so that players such as Keith and Roy Harper, and Frank Coulson moved to more successful clubs. They were nonetheless instrumental in having the WANFL introduce its “Provident Fund” to allow league revenue to be shared amongst the clubs. In 1957 Swan Districts won their first Colts Premiership, repeating the dose in 1958, and these teams provided the nucleus of their successes in the early to middle 1960s.\\nAfter finishing last in 1960, Swan Districts appointed Haydn Bunton junior as senior captain-coach in early 1961, and improvement was immediate. Swan Districts won twelve and drew two of their twenty-one regular season matches to be a clear second and an ingenious tactic by Bunton against champion East Perth ruckman “Polly” Farmer won them a huge upset in the Grand Final, and two more premierships followed in 1962 and 1963. Swans’ fall afterwards was however just as rapid as their rise from 1960 to 1961. In 1964 Swans won seven of their first nine matches, but then State representative calls and form lapses affected the team so badly that they won only two of their final twelve encounters. After achieving their most successful home-and-away season under new captain coach Fred Castledine before being overwhelmed by a mediocre East Fremantle team in the 1965 Grand Final, they fell off completely in the following eight seasons. Swans in this era were hindered by the lack of a full-time coach or secretary that made it harder for them to recruit than other WANFL clubs. In 1968, Swan Districts came nearer to a winless season than any team in senior WA(N)FL competition between 1918 and 1998: winning only one game after the siren by a point against East Fremantle, and scored their all-time lowest score against East Perth. Swan Districts were also last in 1970 and 1971, and not until 1974 did they again make the finals, under the coaching of Jack Ensor, who most unusually never played senior League Football. Again, however, they declined abruptly, falling to wooden spooners in 1977 and 1978.\\n\\nJohn Todd, who took the coaching reins at Bassendean in 1977 and began with a big clean-out of players, brought with him a new winning culture, one which would emulate that of the Haydn Bunton era. By the 1980s, Swans became the dominant side in the WAFL, winning three straight flags in 1982, 1983 and 1984. Swan Districts fell drastically to be last in 1986 and 1988, but rose equally rapidly and after a stint coaching the West Coast Eagles in 1988 and 1989, Todd returned to the club and after being fifth with ten wins in 1989 they won a seventh premiership, beating Claremont 16.7 (103) to 10.17 (77). However, after several unsuccessful finals campaigns between 1991 and 1994 Todd returned to South Fremantle, where he began his football career, and Swan Districts fell rapidly downhill on and off the field under coaches Graham Melrose (1995 and 1996), Phil Cronan (1997 and 1998), Peter Wilson (1999) and Todd again from 2000 to 2002. Between 1995 and 2002 they did not play in the finals and overall won only 51 of 158 games.\\nAt the end of 2002, a season where Swans ran last in all three grades and were as lucky as in 1968 to escape a winless season in the seniors, the club's desperate financial trouble came to the public's attention and a concerted financial drive saw them rise to ten wins and a draw under new coach Steve Turner, and back into the finals in 2004 and 2005. They could not challenge Subiaco or South Fremantle for the flag, and in 2006 fell to only seven wins before Turner gave way to former Eagles star Chris Lewis early in 2007. Brian Dawson took over as coach of the seniors in 2008 and the club rebounded from disappointing results in the previous two years to play in the 2008 Grand Final which they lost to Subiaco. Dawson then steered the team to a preliminary final in 2009. Dawson announced his retirement at the end of the 2010 season. then took the team to the Grand Final which they won over Claremont by a single point.

Although filled with oil, it is electrically heated and does not involve burning any oil fuel; the oil is used as a heat reservoir (buffer), not as a fuel.\\n\\nSection::::How it works.\\nOil heaters consist of metal columns with cavities, inside which a heat transfer oil flows freely around the heater. A heating element at the base of the heater heats up the oil, which then flows around the cavities of the heater by convection. The oil has a relatively high specific heat capacity and high boiling point. The high specific heat capacity allows the oil to effectively transfer thermal energy from the heating element, while the oil's high boiling point allows it to remain in the liquid phase for the purpose of heating, so that the heater does not have to be a high pressure vessel.\\n\\nThe heating element heats the oil, which transfers heat to the metal wall through convection, through the walls via conduction, then to the surroundings via air convection and thermal radiation. The columns of oil heaters are typically constructed as thin fins, such that the surface area of the metal columns is large relative to the amount of oil and element which provides the heat. A large surface area allows more air to be in contact with the heater at any point in time, allowing for the heat to be transferred more effectively, which results in a surface temperature which is safe enough to touch. The relatively large specific heat capacity of the oil and metal parts means this type of heater takes a few minutes to heat up and cool down, providing a short-term thermal store.\\n\\nSection::::Efficiency.\\nAlthough oil heaters are more expensive to run and provide far less spatial heating than gas heaters, they are still commonly used in bedrooms and other small-to-medium-sized enclosed areas. This is because gas heaters, especially when unflued, are not suitable for bedroom use - gas heaters cannot be used in confined spaces due to the reduced oxygen, and the emissions produced. This leaves electrically powered heaters, such as oil heaters and fan heaters, as the only alternative.\\n\\nSeveral efficiency metrics can be measured in regard to heaters, such as the efficiency of heating a room with a given amount of power, and the efficiency of the electrical generator which powers the heater and power loss from transporting the electricity over power lines. Measures may also consider how well a heater keeps the temperature of a space above a certain point. Such a measure would find inefficiencies in heating an already warm room. Many heaters (the majority of available models) are equipped with a thermostat to prevent this inefficient heating, which in turn reduces running costs. This feature was much more common in oil heaters than in the cheaper fan heaters until recently; thus many older oil heaters will be cheaper and more efficient to run than their contemporary fan heaters that lack the thermostat.\\n\\nTypical oil heaters range in power consumption/output from 300 to 2400 watts, and their length and number of columns is roughly proportional to their power rating. A 2400 watt oil heater is usually approximately 1 meter (3.3 feet) in length.\\n\\nAll electric resistance heaters are 100% efficient, with operating costs determined by their wattage and the length of operating time. A 500 watt heater will take at least twice as long to reach the same thermostat setting as a 1000 watt unit; the total consumption of electricity is the same for both.\\n\\nBy contrast, an electrical heat pump used for home heating typically has an efficiency well above 100%, expressed as its coefficient of performance.\\n\\nSection::::Safety and features.\\nThe primary risk of oil heaters is that of fire and burns. In both regards they are generally more dangerous than hydronics and air conditioning, but less dangerous than electric fan heaters or bar radiators; this is due to the surface temperature of each type of heater.\\n\\nMost modern small heaters have some form of tilt sensor to cut power if they are knocked over or placed on an unstable surface. This can reduce the risk of fire if a heater is knocked over.\\n\\nFrom a safety standpoint, it is best to avoid having any object within three feet of an oil heater. Using an oil heater to dry clothes is not recommended by any modern manufacturer. There is a substantial fire risk if flammable materials such as clothing or bedding are left near a heater, especially synthetic fabrics such as polyester, which can melt or burn. Even though the surface temperature of the heater in normal operation is quite low, the extra thermal resistance of the clothing on the heater can cause its surface temperature to rise to the material's autoignition temperature. It should also be noted that some oil heaters contain strong warnings to avoid operation in damp areas (such as bathrooms or laundry rooms) because the moisture and humidity can damage components of the heater itself.\\n\\nOil heaters have been known to explode when their thermal fuses fail to shut them off. This can cause fire, thick black smoke, unpleasant odors, oil on walls and other surfaces, and disfiguring scalding.\\n\\nSome companies offer oil heaters with a fan, to increase the air flow over the heater. Since it is constantly bringing the colder air from the room into contact with the heater, that can improve the rate of heat flow from the heater into the room. The rate of heat flow from the heater into the air in contact with it is higher when there is a greater temperature difference between the heater and the air.\\n\", 'title': 'Oil heater', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11625477'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'khhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '1162889', 'text': \"A.

Breuil initially thought that the microburins had a functional use as a type of microlithic burin. However, he later came to realize that the manufacturing technique was different from that of the burin and that they could be waste products from the manufacture of microliths, but they may have occasionally been reused for a useful purpose.\\n\\nA microburin is a fragment of a lithic flake, or more precisely, of a lithic blade, that shows on its upper face the beginnings of a notch terminating in an oblique flection (whose surface can only be seen from the lower side) that ends in a very acute trihedral apex. As stated earlier, it was thought that microburins were functional microliths, but carving experiments, along with the reassembly of pieces with perfectly aligned edges have demonstrated that they were a characteristic waste of a technique called microburin technique, or more correctly microburin blow technique, following a study of thousands of microburins originating from a variety of \\nsaharan sites.

As of the 2010 census, the town had a population of 1,404. As the town developed at the beginning of the 20th century, it assumed a name derived from its proximity to the District of Columbia—the first syllable of Columbia and that of Maryland were combined to form \"Colmar\". Colmar Manor was incorporated in 1927.\\n\\nSection::::History.\\nSection::::19th Century.\\nThe town is home to Dueling Creek, formerly in Bladensburg, Maryland, a small waterway that because of its secluded location was a popular site for dueling. Duels were banned in neighboring Washington, D.C., but legal in Maryland, and Dueling Creek was the site for more than 50 duels between 1808 and 1868. The most famous duel fought on the site was on March 22, 1820, between Stephen Decatur and James Barron. Decatur was mortally wounded in the exchange.\\n\\nDuring the War of 1812, on August 24, 1814, the area was the scene of the Battle of Bladensburg. The place became a battlefield again in the early days of the Civil War when Confederate troops mounted an assault on Battery Jameson, Fort Lincoln, now northeast Washington, D.C., which was one of a number Union defensive forts built around the nation\\'s capital to protect it from capture. The remains of Fort Lincoln are located on the hillside that is now a part of Fort Lincoln Cemetery.\\n\\nSection::::20th Century.\\nIn 1912, the Capitol Cemetery of Prince George\\'s County was incorporated on the Washington, D.C., boundary line. Directly north of the cemetery was the Shreve estate. The Shreve house was destroyed in the 1890s. The farm site was used by the 6,000 jobless men from Ohio who descended on the Capitol in 1894 as \"Coxey\\'s Army\". Bladensburg Road traversed the area, becoming more heavily traveled in the 1920s, and eventually became designated as U.S. Route 1. Part of the former Shreve estate was subdivided into building lots in 1918. The lots were wide by deep, arranged along a grid pattern of streets. The streets were originally named after President Woodrow Wilson (1913–21), members of his cabinet, and other prominent men of the era. Some time later, the streets were renamed to conform to the system in use in the District of Columbia. The location of the development within the first service area of the Washington Suburban Sanitary Commission offered homeowners modern water and sewer lines. The houses constructed were modest one- and two-story wood-frame buildings. In 1931, the town\\'s streets were paved and gutters were installed. A concrete block municipal building was constructed in 1934, followed by the construction of a brick schoolhouse in 1935. In 1959, a new municipal building was constructed to house the town\\'s administrative offices and police department.\\n\\nDuring the second half of the 20th century, the area along Bladensburg Road, now known as Alternate Route 1, became lined with commercial establishments, and much of the housing stock was used as rental units. A large urban renewal project in the 1970s and 1980s resulted in the demolition of many commercial properties along Bladenburg Road. The old businesses were replaced with new structures such as fast food restaurants and a shopping center. Streets and houses were also improved. The Colmar Manor Community Park was established along the west bank of the Anacostia River in the 1970s on the site of a sanitary landfill.\\n\\nIn 1999, Colmar Manor, Bladensburg, and Cottage City were lauded by the Joint Center for Sustainable Communities for their collaboration with Prince George\\'s County for the Port Towns Revitalization Initiative, which created a common \"Port Towns\" identity for the towns; encouraged businesses development through infrastructure and façade improvements; acquisition of historic properties and plans for their reuse; and reconstruction of the Bladensburg waterfront and marina.\\n\\nSection::::Geography.\\nColmar Manor is located at 38°56\\'2\" North, 76°56\\'49\" West (38.933811, -76.947077).\\n\\nAccording to the United States Census Bureau, the town has a total area of , of which, is land and is water.\\n\\nSection::::Demographics.\\nSection::::2010 census.\\nAs of the census of 2010, there were 1,404 people, 374 households, and 282 families residing in the town.

Barnafoss is near Hraunfossar which burst out of Hallmundarhraun which is a great lava plain. Barnafoss is a waterfall in Western Iceland, about from Reykjavík. Barnafoss is on the river Hvítá in Borgarfjörður. Hraunfossar flows out of a lava field into Hvítá near Barnafoss, creating a stunning scenery.\\n\\nSection::::Barnafoss in folk mythology.\\nMany Icelandic folk tales have been associated with Barnafoss, the most famous being about two boys from a nearby farm, Hraunsás. One day, the boys' parents went with their ploughmen to a church. The boys were supposed to stay at home, but as they grew bored they decided to follow their parents. They made a shortcut and crossed a natural stone-bridge that was above the waterfall. But on their way, they felt dizzy and fell into the water and drowned. When their mother found out what had happened, she put a spell on the bridge saying that nobody would ever cross it without drowning himself. A little while later, the bridge was demolished in an earthquake.\\n\\nAnother waterfall, Barnafoss, is on the River Skjálfandafljót near the abandoned farm Barnafell in Ljósavatn County. There the river runs in a narrow, and close to deep canyon. According to legends, young and brave men jumped across its narrowest parts. During prolonged subzero periods, the spray creates an ice arch across the river above the waterfall and sometimes a rope was strung across the river there to quicken this development. Flocks of sheep were driven over that bridge to graze on Þingey, the island between the two branches of the river.\\n\", 'title': 'Barnafossar', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=1166285'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qRhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11663918', 'text': 'Peter Martin (photographer)\\n\\nPeter Martin is one of Canada\\'s most respected photojournalists having covered over 10,000 assignments over an ongoing 40-year career.

Released for Microsoft Windows in early March 2013, it is the first major installment in the \"SimCity\" series since the release of \"SimCity 4\" a decade prior. An OS X version was released on August 29, 2013.\\n\\nThe game is considered to be a reboot of the \"SimCity\" series. Players can create a settlement that can grow into a city by zoning land for residential, commercial, or industrial development, as well as building and maintaining public services, transport and utilities. \"SimCity\" uses a new engine called GlassBox, allowing for more detailed simulation than previous games. Throughout its development, \"SimCity\" received critical acclaim for its new engine and reimagined gameplay; however, publications cautioned the game\\'s use of a persistent Internet connection, with which it stores saved games and allows players to share resources.\\n\\nPrior to release, \"SimCity\" received positive reviews; however, the game\\'s launch was met with negative reception as a result of widespread technical and gameplay problems related to the mandatory use of a network connection to play and save game data. These issues included network outages, problems with saving progress and difficulty connecting to the game\\'s servers. As a result, some reviewers were unable to review the game, labeling the launch a \"disaster\" and the game as \"unplayably broken\", urging players to avoid purchasing the game until the issues were resolved.\\n\\nSection::::Gameplay.\\nAlong with many of the cosmetic changes (such as up-to-date 3D graphics), \"SimCity\" uses the new GlassBox engine. \"We try to build what you would expect to see, and that\\'s the game,\" explains system architect Andrew Willmott, meaning that visual effects such as traffic, economic troubles, and pollution will be more obvious. Two other new features are a multiplayer component and finite resources.\\n\\nUnlike previous games in the series, the game has non-orthogonal and curved roads and zoning areas that can conform to different road types. Types of zones will include residential, commercial and industrial. The density is driven by the types of roads built around these zones.\\n\\nCities in a region are connected to each other via predefined regional networks such as highways, railways, and waterways. Elements such as traffic and air pollution are visible flowing between cities. Cities can trade resources or share public services with their neighbors like garbage collection or health care. Cities can also pool their collective wealth and resources to build a \"great work\" to provide benefits for the entire region like a massive solar power plant or an international airport. The larger the region, the higher is the number of cities and great works that can be built.\\n\\n\\nModules in \"SimCity\" are attachable structures that can add functionality to existing user-placeable buildings. One example is the extra garage for fire stations, which can provide additional fire trucks for increased protection coverage Another example is the Department of Safety for the City Hall, which unlocks more advanced medical, police and fire department buildings.\\n\\nThe user interface, which was inspired by Google Maps and infographics, was designed to convey information to the player more clearly than in previous \"SimCity\" games. Animations and color-coded visual cues that represent how efficiently a city functions are only presented when needed at any given moment. For instance, opening up the water tower instantly changes the landscape to a clear world where the density of water is recognizable. Or clicking on the sewage tab will immediately show how the waste of the citizens is flowing, and where the system is over capacity. Some of the other visualized data include air pollution, power distribution, police coverage, and zones.\\n\\nMany resources in the game are finite. Some are renewable, such as ground water. Lead gameplay engineer Dan Moskowitz stated, \"If you\\'ve built up an entire city on the economic basis of extracting a certain resource, when that resource runs out your economy will collapse.\"\\n\\nDifferent from some previous \"SimCity\" titles, each type of zone (residential, commercial, and industrial) is not divided into density categories. Instead the density of the roads next to them determines the type of buildings that will be created there. This means that there is only one of each zone type, and density of the buildings are determined by the density of the roads.\\n\\nRoads in \"SimCity\" are one of the most fundamental elements of the mechanics. Unlike previous \"SimCity\" games, roads carry water, power, and sewage. There are also many new tools for drawing roads. They include a straight line tool, one for making rectangular road squares, one for making sweeping arcs, one for making circles, and one for making free-form roads. There is also a more diverse range of roads to choose from. Starting at dirt roads and going up to six lane avenues with street car tracks, the density of the roads determines the density of the buildings next to them, so dirt roads will only develop low density buildings. There are two different categories of roads, streets and avenues. Streets are 24 meters wide and avenues are 48 meters wide. Since all streets are the same width, a dirt road can be upgraded to a high density street. In order to upgrade a street to an avenue, one would need to fully demolish the old street and replace it with a larger avenue. When high and low capacity roads intersect, the higher density roads have the right-of-way, thus stop lights and stop signs will be automatically placed. In order to space the roads so there will be enough room for buildings to develop, road guides are shown when hovering over an existing road.\\n\\nPlayers will be able to specialize cities on certain industries, such as manufacturing, tourism, education, or others. Each have distinct appearances, simulation behavior, and economic strategies. Players have the option to heavily specialize on one or build multiple specializations in any given city for diversity. The game will feature a simulated global economy. Prices of key resources like oil or food will fluctuate depending on the game world\\'s supply and demand. In particular, if players all over the world are predominantly selling drilled oil from within their game onto the global market, this will drive the price for this resource down. Conversely, a resource that has experienced very little exposure on the world market will be a scarce resource, driving the price up.\\n\\nSection::::Multiplayer.\\nThis version of \"SimCity\" is the first to feature full online play since Maxis\\'s \"SimCity 2000 Network Edition\", allowing for regions to house multiple cities from different players. Regions can alternatively be set to private or the game switched to an offline single-player mode for solo play.\\n\"SimCity\" requires players to be logged into EA\\'s Origin service to play the game, including when playing single player. An active Internet connection was required every time the game was launched and had to be maintained throughout gameplay at the time of release. The connection is asynchronous, so any brief network disturbance will not interrupt the gameplay though outages of longer than 19 minutes, as an editor posted on Kotaku, will cause loss of gamestate when playing online.\\nCities in a region can share or sell resources, and work together to build \"Great Works\", such as an Arcology.\\n\\nSection::::Development.\\nPrior to its announcement, the German magazine \"GameStar\" leaked concept art. Soon thereafter, a pre-rendered trailer was leaked. The official announcement took place on March 6, 2012 at the Game Developers Conference. Initially it was revealed that the game would be available for the Windows platform, and a later OS X edition was confirmed. EA showcased two new trailers for the game at the Electronic Entertainment Expo 2012, showcasing in-game graphics for the first time.\\n\\nIn August 2012, applicants were allowed to sign up to test closed beta versions of the game that were later released in January and February 2013, in order to perform load testing on the game servers.\\n\\n\"SimCity\" creative director Ocean Quigley confirmed that an OS X version was in development, but would not be released at the same time as the Microsoft Windows version. A Maxis graphics engineer had earlier commented that the purchase of the Windows version through the Origin platform will entitle access to the future OS X version.\\n\\nSection::::Game engine.\\nEA/Maxis developed the game using a new simulation engine called GlassBox, which takes a different approach from previous simulation games. Those games first simulated high-level statistics and then created graphic animations to represent that data. The GlassBox Engine replaces those statistics with agents, simulation units that represent objects like water, power, and workers; each graphic animation is directly linked to an agent\\'s activity. For example, rather than simply displaying a traffic jam animation to represent a simulated traffic flow problem, traffic jams are instead produced dynamically by masses of Sim agents that simulate travel to and from work.<ref name=\"GlassBox Engine w/ SimCity\"></ref> A four-part video has been released featuring Dan Moskowitz, the lead gameplay engineer, talking about the engine simulation behavior.\\n\\nThe citizens in the game are also agents and do not lead realistic lives; they go to work at the first job they can find and they go home to the first empty home they find.\\n\\nAfter the release of the game, modders created mods that enabled offline play and access to debug developer tools. On January 9, 2014 Maxis published its policy on mods where they allow re-skinning and building creation but not mods that change the gameplay.\\n\\nSection::::Audio.\\nThe game\\'s audio is bound to the pulse of the simulation. When a building is running a simulation rule like generating power for example, its driving music and sound effects that are synchronized to the overall beat of the simulation. The audio is telling the player what the simulation is doing. Audio Director Kent Jolly stated that cars in the game are tracked individually. When a car leaves an intersection, the simulator plays a sound of a car pulling away. The sound also changes based on the speed of the game. As cars go faster, the audio is matched to what the player sees, while remaining true to the actual traffic.\\n\\nChris Tilton is the composer of the game\\'s orchestral score. The music subtly adjusts to the player\\'s experience based on various game states. An example of this is when the view is zoomed out, the player will hear a fuller version of the score. When zoomed in, certain elements of the tracks are taken away. This is done to help make room for all the activity going on in the player\\'s city. The music tracks are also written with population in mind, and the game exposes the full playlist as the player\\'s city develops and grows. Tilton sought to reinvent \"SimCity\"s music and not rehash the musical sensibilities of previous games.\\n\\nSection::::Release.\\nThe initial release of \"SimCity\" on March 5, 2013 in North America suffered multiple severe issues, particularly regarding the game\\'s requirement for a persistent Internet connection. After the game was made available for purchase through EA\\'s Origin delivery service, the high volume of users attempting to download and connect to EA\\'s game servers caused network outages. Players reported experiencing frequent problems during gameplay due to the outages such as long loading times, disconnections, crashing, and loss of saved game data.\\n\\nThe server problems and negative feedback led some publications to refer to the launch as \"disastrous\" and others have compared the launch unfavorably to that of \"Diablo III\", which experienced similar problems when it was first released. The issues caused online retailer Amazon.com to temporarily withdraw the downloadable version of \"SimCity\" from its marketplace citing customer complaints.\\n\\nIt was also discovered that there were several issues with the GlassBox engine such as traffic taking the shortest route instead of the route with the most available capacity and sims not living persistent lives but rather going to the nearest available workplace for work and nearest available house after work.\\n\\nSection::::Post-release.\\nEA responded to server issues by adding additional servers and developing a server patch that disables \"non-critical gameplay features [including] leaderboards, achievements and region filters.\" On the evening of March 7, Maxis general manager Lucy Bradshaw issued a statement in response to the launch problems, stating that more servers would be added over the weekend, thousands of players were playing and \"more than 700,000 cities have been built by our players in just 24 hours\". She went on to acknowledge that \"many are experiencing server instability\" and that \"players across Europe and Asia are experiencing the same frustration\". She confirmed that the number of servers would be increased stating \"We added servers today, and there will be several more added over the weekend.\"\\n\\nSenior producer Kip Katsarelis commented that the game servers were constantly at maximum capacity, partly due to the large number of players connected for extended periods of time, which has made it difficult for new users to connect: \"We added more servers to accommodate the launch in [Australia, Japan, and Europe]... our plan is to continue to bring more servers online until we have enough to meet the demand, increase player capacity and let more people through the gates and into the game.\"\\n\\nIn an article about \"games as a service\", Nathan Grayson from Rock, Paper, Shotgun said that the situation was unacceptable and that EA was handling the situation as well as could be expected, but the problem was that they had damaged the idea of \"games as a service\" and lamented the fact that games publishers hadn\\'t learned from previous similar launch failures: \"this just keeps on happening. ... servers have gone toe-to-toe with day-one stampedes in much the same fashion as a turtle against an 18-wheeler: ... Then nature runs its course, and developers and publishers alike scramble to glue one billion bits of finely pulped turtle back together again,\" and added \"A strong service – the kind people latch onto and ultimately demand as the norm – doesn\\'t just react.\"\\n\\nOn March 8, 2013, EA suspended some of \"SimCity\"s online marketing campaigns because of the game\\'s ongoing technical problems. EA has stated it will not be offering refunds for users.\\n\\nIn a blog post on March 8, Bradshaw gave an update on the server situation, reporting that the issues had improved and server space had expanded, but acknowledged that some users were still suffering stability problems. She also explained the reason for the failure; \"So what went wrong? The short answer is: a lot more people logged on than we expected. More people played and played in ways we never saw in the beta\" and called their error \"dumb\". She reported that server capacity had been increased by 120 percent and that errors had dropped by 80 percent. She also promised another update during the weekend. She also announced an offer of a free game from the EA catalogue, saying \"I know that\\'s a little contrived – kind of like buying a present for a friend after you did something crummy. But we feel bad about what happened. We\\'re hoping you won\\'t stay mad and that we\\'ll be friends again when SimCity is running at 100 percent.\" Maxis ruled out making the game able to be played offline, saying it would take a significant amount of engineering work for this to happen. Shortly afterwards, it was discovered that a line of code could be commented out, allowing the game to be played offline indefinitely. In addition, an article published by Rock, Paper, Shotgun highlighted ways in which, \"They could make an entire region single player offline with absolute ease.\"\\n\\nThe launch failures also led to fans of the series filing a petition through We the People on the official White House website calling for \"an industry-wide return policy for video games that rely on remote servers and DRM to function properly\" which was later covered by mainstream news organizations such as NBC News.\\n\\nTo compensate for the issues during the release, EA offered to early purchasers a free game on March 2013. All Origin users who purchased and registered the game before March 23 were allowed to choose a game for free among a small list of titles including \"SimCity 4\", \"Battlefield 3\", \"Dead Space 3\", \"Mass Effect 3\" and \"\".\\n\\nEA had maintained a Server Status page in the \"SimCity\" website. This allowed players to check the status of \"SimCity\" servers around the world.\\n\\nSection::::Patches.\\nSince the initial release, Maxis has distributed patches to the game via the in-game patching utility that automatically runs when the game is launched on a user\\'s computer. These patches have addressed, though not entirely fixed, among many other things, issues such as traffic intelligence, game-save rollbacks, and emergency vehicle routing. Maxis has continued to update the game to improve gameplay quality and eliminate bugs.\\n\\nA month following the game launch day, Maxis had released 8 official patches, bringing the game to version 1.8. Maxis released a 2.0 patch, purported to make significant improvements to gameplay and curb defects, that was distributed on April 22, 2013. On May 23, 2013, Maxis released patch 4.0, giving players more updates to the game and re-enabling leader boards. Patch 6 was released July 30, 2013, and included the game\\'s second new region added since the original release date. Patch 7.0, a notable update for users, was released on August 22, 2013. This patch included the addition of a bridge and tunnel tool, letting players create overpasses and underpasses. The update also improved traffic, making it smarter. All patches that have been released have included patch notes describing the contents of the patch and can be found on EA\\'s forums.\\n\\nAn offline mode was released in Update 10. The game can now be saved onto the local disk, and cities are static and do not operate while the player is working on an adjacent city.\\n\\nSection::::Expansion.\\nAn expansion called \"Cities of Tomorrow\" was announced on September 19, 2013. It was released on November 12, 2013 and is set 50 years in the future. It features new regions, technology, city specializations, and transportation methods.\\n\\nThe new features in \"Cities of Tomorrow\" are divided into three categories – \"MegaTowers\", \"Academy\" and the \"OmegaCo\". The MegaTowers are massive buildings built floor by floor with each floor having a specific purpose, being residential, commercial or to provide services like schools, security, power and entertainment. Each floor can provide jobs, services or housing for hundreds of citizens at the same time. The Academy is a futuristic research center that provides a signal called \"ControlNet\" to power up structures and improvements developed there and the OmegaCo is composed of factories used to produce an elusive commodity only known as \"Omega\" to increase the profits from residential, commercial and industrial buildings alike and manufacture drones to further improve the coverage of healthcare, police, fire services or just be used by citizens to perform shopping in their places, thus reducing traffic.\\nThe expansion also supports \"futurization\", in which futuristic buildings tend to \"futurize\" the buildings, roads, and services around them by significantly blending the roads and buildings to simply make them look more futuristic, such as differences in traffic lights (they have a different sprite), turning service cars more futuristic (futurizing a police station will significantly change the cars and architecture), and so on. Buildings that will futurize the vicinity are distinguished with a hexagon pattern at the lower part of the building when viewed in the Construction screen.\\n\\nSection::::Reception.\\nSection::::Pre-release.\\nAt E3 2012 in June 2012, \"SimCity\" won 8 awards out of 24 nominations. On August 23, 2012, \"SimCity\" won Gamescom\\'s \"Best PC Game\" award. The Gamescom jury described the video game as having \"fantastic graphics\" and \"struck the right balance between retaining the trademarks of the old parts and making it interesting for beginners\". On December 14, 2012, the \"SimCity\" development team ran a questions and answers session on the Internet community Reddit where they received criticism for the game\\'s DRM-mechanisms, which require the user to be persistently connected to Electronic Arts\\' servers in order to be able to play the game.<ref name=\"reddit.com/r/IAmA\"></ref> The video games-focused blog Kotaku also voiced concern over the issue, worrying that Electronic Arts could one day shut down their servers, rendering the game unplayable.\\n\\nThis prompted a blog response from Bradshaw, in which she defended the always-online component with the comment that \"real cities do not exist in a bubble; they share a region and affect one another.\" She goes on to say that increased connectivity to neighboring cities allows for a better experience, allowing for better trade and wider scale effects such as crime and pollution to keep synchronized across the region. Bradshaw also noted the performance benefit due to the engine using EA\\'s server hardware to assist in gameplay calculations.\\n\\nHowever, \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\" pointed out after the release that cloud resources were not used to support gameplay computation but simply to support inter-city and social media mechanisms. The information was also reported in the mainstream media Those were confirmed by a change in rhetoric from Bradshaw.\\n\\nAfter the first beta, EA Management staff discussed Q4 2012 results during which Peter Moore commented on the success of the beta, \"\"SimCity\", a completely new version of the treasured classic, includes deep online features. More than 100,000 people played the \"SimCity\" beta last weekend, (...) and the critical reception is shaping up well.\"\\n\\nSection::::Critical reception.\\nUpon release, \"SimCity\" was met with mostly mixed reviews, many of which were downgraded after reviewers received reports of server problems. It received mixed to negative reception soon after, with GameRankings and Metacritic assigning scores of 63.82% and 64/100, respectively.\\n\\nThe issues surrounding the launch affected critics\\' opinions and reviews of the game. Eurogamer, CNET, and IGN delayed their reviews due to being unable to connect to the game servers, and Polygon, which had reviewed the game before the launch, later dropped its 9.5/10 score down to 8/10, then later dropping it again to 4/10 in response to both the issues, and EA\\'s decision to disable gameplay features. Josh Derocher of Destructoid gave a rating of 4/10, saying that despite his enjoyment of the game, \"the online dependency, forced multiplayer, and DRM ruin it.\" Other critics such as Rock, Paper, Shotgun also noted the launch issues with the always-online nature of the game, servers, and cloud save systems. According to \"Rock, Paper, Shotgun\", because a server connection is required even for single-player games, \"the game, by its very design, is hideously broken.\" Leif Johnson writing for GameTrailers gave the game an 8.0/10 stating, \"Aside from some issues with its online requirements, bugs, and restrictions on city size, it\\'s still a satisfying and addicting simulator that will grant dozens of hours of entertainment with one well-designed city alone.\" CNET UK reported on March 6 that review aggregator Metacritic accumulated a user score of 2.0/10 and several critics reported that the product on Amazon.com had an average rating of 1/5 stars. Amazon customers and the press reported problems with path-finding and artificial intelligence, broken economic simulation, multiplayer aspect not working as advertised, and iconic features missing compared to previous installments of the game.\\n\\n\"SimCity\" was also criticized for the size of the area the player is given to build a city; critics have noted it to be significantly smaller than what was available in previous games. Maxis responded to this criticism by stating that this was a deliberate compromise to ensure that the game would run smoothly on the majority of users\\' computers. Maxis has acknowledged that city size is a major complaint, but has stated that they are not currently working on an increase in size. However, they have stated that larger areas may appear in an upcoming release or expansion of the game. In October 2013, Maxis stated that due to player feedback, they attempted to implement larger cities through \"months of testing,\" but ultimately decided to abandon the concept as \"the system performance challenges [Maxis] encountered would mean that the vast majority of [SimCity\\'s] players wouldn\\'t be able to load, much less play with bigger cities.\"\\n\\nSection::::\"Cities of Tomorrow\" reception.\\n\"SimCity: Cities of Tomorrow\" received mixed reviews from critics. Brett Todd for GameSpot noted that \"you\\'re left with a game that hides the same dissatisfying experience under a more attractive surface,\" calling the expansion \"more of the same.\" Paul Dean for EuroGamer wrote the expansion pack was \"heading in the right direction,\" but \"it still doesn\\'t make SimCity a particularly good game.\"\\n\\nSection::::Commercial.\\n\"SimCity\" sold over 1.1 million copies in its first two weeks, 54 percent of which were of the download version of the game. As of July 2013 the game has sold over two million copies.\\n', 'title': 'SimCity (2013 video game)', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11664080'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'qxhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11665055', 'text': 'Lauri Viljanen\\n\\nLauri Viljanen (1900, Kaarina, Southwest Finland – 1994) was a Finnish literary critic and writer.\\n\\nHe was the leading critic of the literary group Tulenkantajat (The Flame Bearers) during the 1930s and 1940s.\\n\\n', 'title': 'Lauri Viljanen', 'url': 'https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki?curid=11665055'}}}, {'index': {'_index': 'birdie-wiki-final', '_type': 'articles', '_id': 'rBhR_GoBH77kAisjAZi3', 'status': 403, 'error': {'type': 'cluster_block_exception', 'reason': 'blocked by: [FORBIDDEN/12/index read-only / allow delete (api)];'}, 'data': {'id': '11666975', 'text': 'Fermentation starter\\n\\nA fermentation starter (called simply starter within the corresponding context, sometimes called a mother) is a preparation to assist the beginning of the fermentation process in preparation of various foods and s.
